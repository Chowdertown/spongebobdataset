[The episode begins at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff are getting ready for a camping trip in the kelp forest.]
Mrs. Puff: [laughs while reading a camping brochure] We are going to have so much fun! A weekend in a cabin in the woods with the Gal Pals!
Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff: Gal Pals! Yeah!
[Mrs. Puff takes out a Krabby Patty and goes to eat it.]
Karen: [takes the Krabby Patty from Mrs. Puff] Oh, a Krabby Patty! [squeezes its juice in the boatmobile's engine] Perfect.
Mrs. Puff: [grossed out] Ugh.
Karen: The engine needed greasing. [closes the boatmobile's hood]
Sandy: [lassos the trailer towards her] Congratulations, Mrs. Puff! [hooks the trailer on the boatmobile] Your boat and trailer just got hitched! [puts a bride tiara and groom hot on both the boatmobile and trailer, throws some confetti and shares a good laugh with Karen and Mrs. Puff]
Mrs. Puff: [checks her watch] Hmm, I wonder what's keeping our newest Gal Pal?
[Meanwhile, the newest member of the Gal Pals, Pearl Krabs, is skipping down the road with her backpack.]
Pearl: This is gonna be so funny. The Gal Pals will obviously try to prank the newbie, but this newbie is gonna prank them right back. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [pops out of Pearl's backpack] Boo! Who likes eggs? [laughs]
Pearl: Not now, SpongeBob. [stuffs SpongeBob back in her backpack] Wait until you're around the campfire. And you're supposed to act scary, not lame.
SpongeBob: Oh, scary. Got it! Wait until the fire then make with the scary. [makes goofy faces and weird noises]
Pearl: [pushes SpongeBob in her backpack] Keep working on it. [meets up with Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff]
Sandy: Here comes our newest member!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Gal Pals! Yeah!
[The four girls share a good laugh.]
Sandy: Here, let me get your bag. [takes Pearl's backpack and throws it in the trailer]
[The girls stuff the trailer with many camping supplies: tents, sleeping bags, sporting equipment, lanterns, pillows, extra blankets, umbrellas, food, a grill, swimwear, and suitcases with extra clothing. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out through all those camping supplies just as the trailer door closed.]
SpongeBob: Nice and cozy.
[The girls climb in the boatmobile and begin driving away to the kelp forest.]
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: ♪We're Gal Pals and, yes, we shall conquer the world one day! We're no sea bunnies, we're smart and funny and we demand equal pay! We'll shout "Gal Pals" right into your ear canal and bang it on a drum! We're sweet and nice, but take our advice cross us and you'll be chum!♪
[The girls' singing comes to an abrupt halt when they see a moose snail in the middle of the road. They let the moose snail cross and drive away while sharing another good laugh.]
Mrs. Puff: Ooh, this is gonna be so much fun! We're gonna have a real adventure with our newbie, aren't we, ladies?
[Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff snicker quietly together. Pearl makes a nervous laugh and share another good laugh with the others. Pearl quietly snickers to herself for the prank she planned on her own. Suddenly, the trailer hits a bump and gets unhooked by the boatmobile. The trailer skidded off the road and rolls down into a ditch filled with mud. SpongeBob, feeling sick, climbs out of the trailer, slips on the mud, and gets a bit messy. He wrings the mud off him.]
SpongeBob: Where am I? [climbs out of the mud pit and finds himself in the kelp forest] Huh? All right, I'll just sit tight and wait to hear from Pearl. I've got the trailer, so there's plenty of food and blankets. [the trailer full of camping supplies sink in the mud; he growls and kicks a pebble] Barnacles! Now what am I gonna do? [sticks his hands in his pockets and finds a peanut] Hey, a peanut! A lucky peanut! Mm, I'm not gonna go hungry out here. I'm gonna survive! [his voice echoes] Wait a minute, I can't eat this peanut. You're my lucky peanut. [giggles] I've got a lucky peanut! [his voice echoes again]
[Meanwhile, the girls made it to the cabin they rented for their camping trip.]
Mrs. Puff: Here we are.
Sandy: [notices the trailer is gone] Uh-oh, looks like we lost something.
Pearl: [gasps] Oh, no, my backpack! This is the worst thing that could ever happen! [cries a river of tears]
Karen: [comforts Pearl] Aww, there, there, sweetie. It's just a backpack. We can buy you a new one. It's not like losing a friend.
Pearl: [stops crying and whimpers] She must be psychic. [resumes crying]
Sandy: Aww, heck, we'll just have to rough it! [opens the door and sees the cabin a complete mess; there are bones, algae, toadstools, cobwebs, a wolfworm who steals a bone and runs off, and the floor and ceiling are decaying] All right, gals, let's not just hang here like mama's washing! Time to gussy up the place!
[The scene changes to the cabin looking good as new. It now has a radio with stereo equipment, new wallpaper, a lamp, some beanbag chairs, a sofa, a dining table with chairs, a chandelier, some new windows, and a refrigerator filled with many kinds of food.]
Karen: Good thing we have a Texas tornado among the Gal Pals. Who knew you could use a jellyfish as a recharger. [grabs a jellyfish and recharges herself with its stingers] Oh, yeah. [sighs and faints]
Sandy: Yep, nature always provides.
Mrs. Puff: [sets a cornucopia with food in it on the table] Hey, where's the newbie?
[Pearl is outside the cabin trying to contact with SpongeBob on her cellphone.]
Pearl: Oh...Oh, please, SpongeBob, be all right. [dials the number on her cellphone]
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is exploring the kelp forest by swinging on vines like a jungle man.]
SpongeBob: [making goofy jungle noises while swinging] I'm Sponge-zan of the brine apes! [swings on several vines, crashes into a tree, and falls in a bush; then he hears ringing sounds and takes out the peanut] Oh, my lucky peanut's ringing. [pulls a human ear out of his head] Hello? [hears ringing in his other pocket, takes out a shellphone and answers it] Shell-lo? [laughs]
Pearl: SpongeBob! Oh, thank Neptune, you're still alive.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Pearl, I'm still gonna do the prank. I just have to find your cabin. Are there any landmarks I can head to?
Pearl: Uh, well, there are a lot of trees.
SpongeBob: Trees, perfect! I'll just follow the trees. [hangs up the shellphone] Are you sure you didn't ring, too, lucky peanut? Hello, hello? Ugh, bad reception. No peanut bars. [the peanut shows connection bars on it; he puts it in his pocket and goes to follow the trees] Follow the trees! Follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees, follow the trees...
[As time passes, day turns to nighttime. The girls are sitting together around the campfire drinking kelp cocoa.]
Mrs. Puff: [slurps some kelp cocoa] Oh, this kelp cocoa is delicious.
Karen: [scans her kelp cocoa] Yeah, my sensors indicate an agreeable flavor. [dumps her kelp cocoa on the ground]
Sandy: [grabs a flashlight] Okay, Gal Pals, [turns it on and leans it to her helmet] it's time to initiate our newest member. [turns it off and puts a Gal Pal necklace on Pearl]
Mrs. Puff: You are now a Gal Pal.
Pearl: That's it? Just this necklace? No swats or parading around in my PJ's? No tryin' to scare me with urban legends?
Sandy: Why would we do that?
Karen: Yeah, we like you.
Mrs. Puff: We haven't had a forth member since that incident with Flibberty Gibbet. I—[gets her mouth shut by Sandy]
Sandy: Puff! Shh.
Pearl: Who's "Slippery Giveth"?
Sandy: Oh, Flibberty Gibbet. She was the fourth member of our group. We had a fight with her years ago right here at this very cabin one dark and stormy night. [thunder crashes in her eyes]
Mrs. Puff: We don't even remember what the fight was about.
[While Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff explain, their shadows tell every detail of the argument they had with Flibberty Gibbet.]
Sandy: It sure was a humdinger of an argument!
Karen: She went bananas and vowed to destroy any and all the Gal Pals. [the green line on her screen turns red]
Mrs. Puff: Then she just ran off into these woods!
Sandy: Some say she's still out there, all hot-headed and waiting to get her revenge. [hides in her suit]
Karen: That's her pendant you're wearing.
Pearl: [looks at the pendant and sees Flibberty Gibbet's name on it] "Flibberty Gibbet"?! [screams in fear, takes off the necklace and throws it away] Why did you give me that? Why did you take me here?! [Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff laugh; Pearl blushes and laughs as well] Thanks, gals, you got me. But I knew you were gonna prank me.
Karen: Sure you did.
Mrs. Puff: You should have seen your face.
Sandy: We got you good!
[While the girls are talking, a creepy hand comes out and takes the pendant.]
Pearl: [laughs] Mm, Gal Pals.
[All of a sudden, the girls hear scary sounds from within the trees. Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff huddle together in fear.]
Sandy: [gasps] What was that?
Pearl: 'Kay, you can stop trying to scare me. I know Flipperty Giblets is a prank.
Karen: Flibberty Gibbet is partly true.
Mrs. Puff: She was a Gal Pal. We did have a fight with her.
Sandy: And she did run off into these woods.
Pearl: Wait, that was all the parts!
[The scary sounds are getting louder. Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff quiver in fright.]
Mrs. Puff: Quick, let's hide in the cabin!
Pearl: Wait, it—it's okay. It's only SpongeBob. I asked him to make noise and prank you. All right, SpongeBob, you can come out! I'm canceling the prank!
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is still following the trees. But it turns out that he's only walking back and forth from one tree to the other.]
SpongeBob: [laughs quietly and touches a tree] There's another tree. [skids to the tree next to it] And another tree. Wow, following the trees really works. [touches the trees between him] Tree, tree, tree, tree.
[Back at the cabin, the girls are still sitting by the campfire.]
Mrs. Puff: So, SpongeBob thinks he can prank us, huh? We'll prank him right back. [begins to go insane] We can rig up the cabin with trap doors, flying ghosts, and a thousand cadavers in a zombie ballroom! [covers her mouth after realizing she's losing her composure] Ooh, what am I saying?
Sandy: Let's scale it down a smidge.
Karen: Yeah, let's hide behind this tree and scream when he shows up.
[The girls hide behind a nearby tree and giggle.]
Sandy: You coming, Pearl?
Pearl: Well, I'm certainly not staying by myself in the dark. [joins the girls in hiding behind the tree to prank SpongeBob]
Sandy: Shh, he's coming. Wait for it. Now!
[The girls jump out and make a loud, scary scream. However, it turns out that it was just a scary old lady, not SpongeBob. The old lady roars angrily.]
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Flibberty Gibbet! [scream as they run into the cabin and try to hold the door shut]
Mrs. Puff: It's her! Oh, s—she looks like she's been in the woods too long!
Sandy: I have a plan. We'll run out the back door and into Puff's boat. Count of three. One, two, three!
[The girls run from the door and scream. The old lady breaks through the front door and roars. The girls run out the back door and jump into the boatmobile.]
Karen: Let's go!
[Just then, SpongeBob jumps out and makes scary noises.]
SpongeBob: Rawr! Hmm? [shrugs and skips to the cabin's front door]
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: No, no! SpongeBob! Don't go in!
SpongeBob: [sees the girls] Oh, hello.
[The old lady grabs SpongeBob and drags him in the cabin. SpongeBob's screaming is heard from the inside. The girls scream in horror.]
Sandy: Gal Pals, we have to save SpongeBob!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: [whimpering] Gal Pals.
[The girls break through the front door to rescue SpongeBob. But, to their relief and surprise, the old lady turns out to be a sales lady giving SpongeBob pinecones on a stick.]
SpongeBob: Wow! [the old lady gives SpongeBob a pinecone on a stick] Ooh, another pinecone on a stick! I love it. [takes it and gets another one from the old lady] Wow! [takes another pinecone on a stick] I'm gonna get one of these for each of the Gal Pals.
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: [confused] Huh?
Sandy: [laughs in relief] It's only a cabin-to-cabin country sales lady. Not Flibberty Gibbet at all.
Flibberty Gibbet: [off-screen] Did someone say my name? [the girls turn and see her for real this time] Hi, gals!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Flibberty Gibbet! [scream as they run out of the cabin and into the woods]
Flibberty Gibbet: I—I just wanted to say all's forgiven!
SpongeBob: [follows the girls] Hey, wait! You'll need my lucky peanut!
Sandy, Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl: Gal Pals! [crash onto the screen]
[The words "The End" is shown and the episode ends.]


[Inside in his pineapple house, SpongeBob is laying in bed snoring. His foghorn alarm sounds and he wakes up immediately; then, he inhales deeply and sighs before opening his window curtains]
SpongeBob: Good morning, day! [he begins to walk, but accidentally steps on the top of his big toe] Ow! [falls over, but gets back up with his toe sore] I stubbed my toe! [he cries profusely, and continuously like a fountain, leaving a puddle surrounding him] I stubbed my toe! I was walking around and I stubbed my toe! [later, he walks into his closet and searches though a long line of identical SquarePants while humming; he picks one, but the wire hanger rips through the side] D'oh, that was my favorite shirt. [cries; later, he appears at his breakfast table eating oatmeal while listening to the radio]
Radio DJ: And that was "Aja" by Eely Dan. Next up is Lionel Fishy with his hit, "Sad Song."
[The sad song begins to play, and SpongeBob begins sobbing again.]
SpongeBob: That's a sad song!
Squidward: [inside his house, wearing a robe and towel, while holding a cup of tea and a danish] That SpongeBob is such a crybaby. Lucky me, I get to work with him all day. [he takes a bite out of his danish while SpongeBob continues to cry from inside his house; later, at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is flipping Krabby Patties while singing]
Mr. Krabs: [enters abruptly, startling SpongeBob, who flips the patty into the air] SpongeBob, guess what? [the patty lands on the ground] Yeah, I'll come back later. [goes back into his office, SpongeBob sadly picks the patty up by his spatula and carries it to the trash can]
SpongeBob: He was a good little Krabby Patty. [sniffs] I didn't know him well, but in the few short seconds between grill and floor, I--[opens the trash lid and begins crying]--I came to love him! [the patty slowly slides off his spatula and into the trash bin] It just isn't fair! [he cries even louder, soaking and enraging Squidward from the counter window]
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you stop crying?!
SpongeBob: But the Krabby Patty fell on the floor and he—
Squidward: Krabby Patty nothing! [SpongeBob tries to speak again, but Squidward interrupts him very loudly] Krabby Patty nothing! [he pants heavily, then SpongeBob whimpers with tears] What now?
SpongeBob: [stifled] You yelled at me! You yelled at me!!! [sobs even louder than before, continuing to soak Squidward with tears while Squidward gives himself a depressed look on his face, realizing yelling isn't going to help]
Squidward: All right, look. So far today, and it's not even 2:00 yet, you have cried 43 times.
SpongeBob: And you wrote that number on a chalkboard.
Squidward: Yes!
SpongeBob: Why?
Squidward: [pauses for a second] I have no idea.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, there's no way I cry that much. There's not that many tears in my brain.
Squidward: Au contraire. [turns on a TV]
SpongeBob: What's this?
Squidward: It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years.
[the video begins to play, showing SpongeBob crying in the Krusty Krab, in a grocery store, at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, in Jellyfish Fields, in the bathroom, and more like near a bus stop for no reason]
SpongeBob: [in the video] Boo! Hoo! Boohoo! Sob. Whimper.
Narrator: Thousands of tears later...
[SpongeBob continues to watch himself crying in the video]
SpongeBob: Wow, guess I do cry a lot. I promise I won't cry anymore.
Squidward: Oh, nonsense! I bet you can't go the rest of the day without crying.
SpongeBob: [realizes something] Excuse me a minute. [he walks up to a rotary telephone and dials it, Patrick appears lazily sitting on his couch when his own phone rings]
Patrick: [answers it] Star... residence. Patrick speaking.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Hey, buddy! Is it 7:30 already?
SpongeBob: No, I'm still at work.
Patrick: How can I help you?
SpongeBob: Do you think that I could go the rest of the day without crying?
Patrick: [mouth full with popcorn] Well, of course you can.
SpongeBob: Okay, great, thanks, Patrick.
Patrick: Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?
SpongeBob: Yeah, but I left it in a different spot. Just ask Gary, he knows where it is.
Patrick: Oh, yeah. [laughs with his mouth full] Hey, good one, buddy. You almost had me there.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Okay.
Patrick: Yeah, talk to you later.
SpongeBob: All right, see ya. [hangs up, then walks back up to Squidward] Okay, it's a bet.
Squidward: [shakes SpongeBob's hand] Fine. If you cry one tear before midnight, you have to... [thinks] Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year.
SpongeBob: Sounds fair to me. And if I make it to midnight without crying, you'll come to a slumber party at my place. Just you and me. [Squidward retches and swallows] Ooh, what's the matter?
Squidward: Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth. [begins talking in his thoughts] No need to worry, Squiddy. You've outdone yourself. He'll be crying in ten minutes. [laughs out loud; in the evening, he and SpongeBob are now walking home from work]
SpongeBob: Thanks again for walking home with me, Squidward.
Squidward: There's a first time for everything. [under his breath] Also, I'd like to win this bet as soon as possible. [chuckles devilishly]
SpongeBob: [hears this; speaking in his thoughts] I am not gonna cry. I am not gonna cry. [straining, he speaks out loud] I can do this!
Squidward: [smiling] Do what? [sees something and gasps] Oh, my! What a lovely sunset. Take a look, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob looks at the sunset and gasps] Isn't that beautiful?
SpongeBob: I've never seen such a beautiful underwater sunset.
Squidward: Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it?
SpongeBob: [gasps quietly in awe] It's... [the Bikini Bottom Choir drives by singing an angelic note, Squidward chuckles as SpongeBob's eyes begin to twinkle and water]
Squidward: Is that a tear I see? [the sunset disappears; SpongeBob snaps out]
SpongeBob: Oh, well, sunset's over. [walks off, Squidward scoffs in frustration; later, they both enter SpongeBob's house] Nice of you to drop in, neighbor.
Squidward: Nice of you to have me, I--[sees something] Oh, look SpongeBob. Gary's sleeping.
[Gary appears on a stack of newspapers sleeping, snoring and meowing]
SpongeBob: [with his hands together, up to his mouth] Aww. He looks like an angel.
Squidward: That is just so adorable. Almost makes you want to cry.
[Gary begins to drool in his sleep]
SpongeBob: Yeah... [snaps out of it] No! There shall be no tears in this house tonight! [walks off into the kitchen] La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
[the mail comes in through the mail slot in SpongeBob's door]
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [pouring drinks] Yes?
Squidward: Your mail's here. Ooh, oh look, it's a postcard from your dear mother and father so far away.
SpongeBob: [turns around] Mother, father?
Squidward: [reading the postcard] "Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much.
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed at first] Ohh... [grabs another postcard; snaps out] My subscription to Jellyfishing Monthly's expired. Remind me to renew that, will you, Squidward?
Squidward: [with spite] No problem.
[Later on, SpongeBob and Squidward sit on the couch watching the news]
Anchor Fish: Welcome back to Bikini Bottom News. Our top story tonight: a series of sad tales.
Squidward: Ooh, let's turn it up.
Anchor Fish: Tragedy in the park when a young snail caught in a tree almost didn't get down.
Petey: [stuck on a coral tree branch] Meow.
[SpongeBob gasps and gets ready to cry]
Anchor Fish: However, he did get down.
SpongeBob: [raising his arms] Hooray!
Anchor Fish: Coming up, an interview with a manatee who didn't get what he wanted for his birthday.
SpongeBob: [sad again] Oh, no.
Anchor Fish: And finally, sad news for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fans.
[Squidward excitedly raises up the volume]
SpongeBob: [voice breaks] What, what, what?
Anchor Fish: They will only be showing The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Show seven times a day instead of eight—
SpongeBob: [sweating, changes the channel] Let's watch something else Squidward, okay?!
Squidward: Fine!
[the channel changes to a show where a dad fish is walking out of his house for work while a kid fish plays with a baseball in the yard]
Kid Fish: Hey, Dad, how about a game of catch? [he throws the baseball in front of his bored dad]
Unnamed father: Sorry, son, I'm late for work.
Kid Fish: [disappointingly] Okay, Dad. [his dad throws the baseball back]
Unnamed father: [tosses his briefcase] I guess I can stay for a few throws.
Kid Fish: [teary-eyed] I love you, Dad.
Unnamed father: [teary-eyed] I love you, son.
[the show ends with the two happily playing catch, SpongeBob turns the TV off and madly throws it out of his window, then walks back to the couch panting]
SpongeBob: [to Squidward] You know what they say about that television. Rots the brain.
Patrick: [from outside] Hey, thanks for the TV, SpongeBob! [he carries the broken-up TV set on his head] I'm gonna watch it all night! [he runs into his rock house with it. SpongeBob and Squidward awkwardly stare at each other, Squidward glances at the cuckoo clock, which says 8:41, then speaks in his thoughts]
Squidward: It's getting late. I'd better bring out the big guns. [out loud] Oh, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?
Squidward: What would you say to a little music? [pulls out his clarinet]
SpongeBob: [gasps happily] I'd say... I'll go get some refreshments. [walks off]
Squidward: Don't be long. My secret weapon is waiting. [gets out sheet music titled "Hearts &amp; Flowers (or Some Such Sad Song)," then chuckles]
SpongeBob: [appears, holding a tray of tea] You said something, Squidward?
Squidward: Oh, I just said, "Relax and enjoy the song." [he begins playing the such sad song on his clarinet, SpongeBob goes stifled, trying to fight back tears, Squidward strains hard playing the last single note, then pants]
SpongeBob: That's a really sad song, Squidward.
Squidward: You're not gonna cry though, are you?
SpongeBob: No. [Squidward growls, the scallop cuckoo clock then chirps 9:00] Time really does fly when you're having fun. Well, I'd better start getting ready for bed. [starts to put the tray of tea down]
Squidward: [nervously] Uh, SpongeBob. No-no-no-no, wait.
SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?
Squidward: How about a bedtime story?
SpongeBob: Now you're talking! [later in his room, he lays in bed with Squidward] Whatcha gonna read me, Squidward?
Squidward: Umm... [nervously searches through the pages] How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost?
SpongeBob: That sounds like a very sad story.
Squidward: Oh, very sad. Umm... "There once was a little angler [the page he's reading is actually of the story Jack and Jill] who was, uh, little and sad. [SpongeBob whimpers] One day the little sad angler was walking through the park. [SpongeBob begins to chuckle with joy]
SpongeBob: Walking...
Squidward: But, he was sad, because...because he was lost... he was lost and very sad. And then, he— he started to cry. [SpongeBob begins to choke up] He cried and he cried. And he cried even more. [SpongeBob shakes with sadness] And he kept crying... [SpongeBob strains and forces back tears] ...and crying and crying and crying and...that's right. You can do it.
SpongeBob: I'm wondering if it might not be so healthy to hold in all my tears, Squidward.
Squidward: You're exactly right, SpongeBob. Let it all out. Don't fight the feel--[the second hand on the clock ticks closer to midnight] Ten, nine...do it, do it, cry...eight, seven, six, five...come on! [the dam inside SpongeBob's brain begins to crack] ...four, three, two, one! [the dam breaks, and a river of tears begins to rush out] Midnight! [sighs, SpongeBob's body is turning wide] Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the... [SpongeBob's eyes burst with tears, shooting a flood towards Squidward and smacking him against the wall. The tears shoot out the windows, door crack, chimney, and other holes in his house. They spread to Patrick's house, causing an entire waterfall inside]
Patrick: Wow, what a great show.
[The tears flood the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [standing on his desk, holding a fat stack of money away from the tears] Well, at least we're still together, little ones.
[The Bikini Bottom Choir drives through the flood holding the angelic note; at SpongeBob's house, the tears continue to spray into Squidward's face, then stop; the cuckoo scallop hits him on the head. Now, SpongeBob and Squidward sit in front of the TV]
SpongeBob: [holding out a bowl of popcorn] More popcorn, Squidward?
Squidward: No, no. No, no. Please.
SpongeBob: [eating popcorn] Don't be shy now. I made extra. [Squidward begins to whimper, SpongeBob rubs his shoulders] That's all right, let it out. You can cry all you want. You're among friends here.
[Squidward whimpers even harder then starts bawling hysterically]


[The camera zooms in on SpongeBob sitting crying in the area between his pineapple and Squidward's house. He lies down face-down and his tears send him up and down off the ground. He goes back to normal crying while sitting, he then bends his top half in towards his bottom half. Patrick walks up, picks SpongeBob up, and pats his back.]
Patrick: There, there, SpongeBob. No need to cry.
SpongeBob: [pops off Patrick's shoulder] Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for 2 whole days.
Patrick: 2 whole days?!?! [tears pour out of his eyes like a hose as he begins to wail]
SpongeBob: Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!
Patrick: Tejas! [cries]
SpongeBob: [sniffles, looks at his watch] She won't be back for 1 more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds!
Patrick: Oh, 47 seconds! [SpongeBob and Patrick cry tears in each others faces] I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles, [waves his arms] the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose! [a nose like Squidward's pops onto his face]
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's Squidward. [Patrick's Squidward-like nose disappears] He's not gone, he's right here. [pan over to Squidward planting a flower]
Squidward: [he is shown wearing a gardening hat and holding a shovel and holding a flower in one hand and a trowel in the other. He is also digging a hole. He finishes digging the hole and looks at SpongeBob.] No, I'm not. [drops the flower into the ground and walks into his home, slamming the door behind him]
SpongeBob: I sure do miss that squirrel. [sniff] Her karate chopping, [karate chops ground] that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth? [his buck teeth come together and sparkle. They return to normal.] After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her.
Patrick: Is Sandy the one I call Mom?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome! [runs off, distorted trumpet fanfare plays]
Patrick: Wa-hey! [Patrick runs after SpongeBob.]
[The scene changes to show Sandy's house. SpongeBob and Patrick sneak into it with party supplies. SpongeBob twirls the handle open and the two run in and start painting on a blue banner with light blue paint. SpongeBob writes from left to right, and Patrick does the opposite. They run out of space on the banner, and it reads "WELCOMANDY." Balloons rise up, transitioning to Patrick inhaling deeply. He holds an un-inflated balloon to his water helmet and tries to blow it up, failing. SpongeBob walks over, knocking on Patrick's Helmet to get his attention. He looks up at the tree. Patrick and SpongeBob jump out of the tree holding balloons. The balloons fill with air as the two float down. They stop, floating in mid-air just above the ground and start to kick their legs trying to reach it. There is another balloon transition to SpongeBob icing a cake which reads "WELCOME HOME SANDY!"]
SpongeBob: Ah. [cake is shown, with two red hearts on the both sides of the of the word "Home." SpongeBob sets the icing down. The cake is missing from the tray and SpongeBob gasps. Patrick is next to him eating the cake. His water helmet is sitting on the table. He notices SpongeBob glaring at him, pulls the cake out of his mouth and sets it on the tray. The cake is now in the shape of Texas] Huh? [View of the cake. The two red hearts are at the top of the Texas-shaped cake, above the words "Welcome Home Sandy!" written in cursive. The 'y' in 'Sandy' curls down to a waving SpongeBob and Patrick decoration. The two smile, SpongeBob has a "good job" type smile and Patrick has a reluctant smile. There is another balloon transition to Patrick and SpongeBob pulling ropes to hang a blue "WELCOME 'DOME' SANDY" banner in the branches of the tree. A wooden sign points out from the top of the tree that reads "WE MISSED YOU!" Balloons are hung in the tree's branches as well as pink banners.] We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be in about... [He looks at his watch] ...Whoo! Right now! [The normal submarine-like bus comes down the road, pulls up to Sandy's house and stops. The door opens and Sandy walks out, carrying a suitcase. Patrick and SpongeBob run out from the treedome and stop in front of Sandy] ♪ Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya! ♪
Nat Peterson: [off-Screen] NO! [on-Screen] NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR YOU SING!
Sandy: Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy. [bus drives off]
SpongeBob: That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy! [Sandy giggles. The three go inside the treedome] First cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then...
Sandy: [She notices the decorations the two had put up earlier] Wow, guys! You two, uh... [she scratches her neck. All but her helmet is off] Really know how to, uhhh... [scratches her back] throw a party...
SpongeBob: I knew it! You have been itching to see us!
Sandy: Well, something's making my skin crawl.
SpongeBob: Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide. [The scene changes to show the three at the picnic table with cake.] Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return. [SpongeBob passes a slice of the cake to Patrick]
Patrick: This is gonna taste so good again.
SpongeBob: Dig in, Sandy! [Sandy is scratching her back with a fork] Uh...
Sandy: Looks... tasty, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [He drops his fork] Are you okay, Sandy?
Sandy: I'm fine. My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air. [Sandy's fur begins to be pulled out with her scratching, it floats onto SpongeBob's plate and slice of cake. He moves the plate away with his fork, looking disgusted. He looks over to Patrick and sees him combing the hair on his cake, formed into a mustache and hairdo]
SpongeBob: Uh... hey, Sandy. Sandy. [he pokes her back, and holds up a pink box with a red ribbon on it] Surprise! [sets it on the table] Patrick and I chipped in and got ya a little somethin' somethin'.
Sandy: Aww, guys, you shouldn't have. [she rips the wrapping and lid off of the box, and lifts up a purple sandboard] A new itch board? I mean, a new snowboard? Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain.
SpongeBob: Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?
Sandy: Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat.
SpongeBob: Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?
Sandy: [still scratching her neck] Rashy sore! I mean, sure!
SpongeBob: [the scene changes to show SpongeBob and Sandy in their karate gear] Ya ready? [Sandy scratches her back with her karate gloves on] And how 'bout now? You ready?
Sandy: [gets on the floor and scratches her head like a dog, then gets up and scratches her arm] Creepin' critters! Feels like somethin's bitin' me. [she looks at her arm closely, her eyes move back and forth, she spots a flea. The flea is biting Sandy's skin. The flea looks up and screeches] I've got a flea? Well, I ain't gonna take that without a fight! [she karate chops her arm] Hi...yah! [the flea jumps off Sandy's arm and lands on her leg] I'll get ya! [she chops her leg three times and tosses her gloves away. She starts biting her leg. SpongeBob and Patrick stare at her, then look at each other. Sandy scratches her leg and her back with her hands, then turns over to scratch her back. SpongeBob walks over] SpongeBob, my suitcase! Hurry! [SpongeBob brings over a blue suitcase. Sandy opens it] I'm ashamed to say this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea. [she digs around to get something]
SpongeBob: What's a flea?
Sandy: A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'. [the flea jumps off Sandy and lands on SpongeBob's hand. The flea screeches]
SpongeBob: Ahahaha, he tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad! [the flea bites him] OWWWW! [gasps] He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?
Sandy: No, but you can use this one right quick. [she puts the collar on SpongeBob's wrist. The flea jumps off SpongeBob and lands on Patrick's belly]
Patrick: Ow! Ah, ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah! [breathes heavily, then notices the bite marks on him] Hahaha, connect the dots! [pulls out a pencil and draws lines between the bite marks] I drawed a horsey! [we see the "horse" he drew for a moment and the flea still bites him] Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?
Sandy: 'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites ya, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition.
Patrick: I've been bit by a vampire flea! [looks up into the air] Noooooo! I'm gonna turn into a vampire now! [starts pulling out grass] It's already happening!! Ah, ah!! [growls, blows raspberry, his tongue goes around his mouth, then opens and closes mouth and has a squirrel nose]
Sandy: Patrick, [Patrick's nose disappears] there ain't no such thing as vampires.
Patrick: [scratches side like a dog] Augh! Doesn't matter! [grabs flea collar off SpongeBob] Oh, this itch is killing me! Yagh!!! [puts the collar on like a belt. The flea jumps off Patrick screeching and lands back on Sandy. She starts scratching]
Sandy: Aah! Gimme that! [she takes the collar and puts it on her neck] Phew! [the flea jumps back on SpongeBob and goes under his tie]
SpongeBob: Nyahh! Oh. Sandy, please. Hellllp meeeee! [Scratches]
Sandy: [holds onto the collar] I need this!
SpongeBob: I need it more. [takes the collar and wears it like a belt. The flea jumps of of him and onto Patrick.]
Patrick: Eee! [grabs the collar]
Sandy: Yah! [the flea jumps and goes in Sandy's nose. The flea passes by both eyes and scratches the inside. Sandy shrieks and takes the collar. They all fight for it and at one point, Patrick throws SpongeBob aside. Sandy is exhausted from scratching. Then the flea lays eggs. The eggs hatch and two fleas emerge screeching. The three fleas jump off of Sandy's head. The fleas land on SpongeBob and he spins around on the floor scratching] Enough! I will not take this anymore! [wraps the collar around SpongeBob, Patrick, and herself] Whatcha gonna do now, punks? [the fleas jump off of them] Looky, it worked! Phew. I'm glad that's over.
SpongeBob: Um, is that what "over" looks like? [he points to an increasing amount of fleas]
Sandy: Tarnation! They're multiplyin' like mad! [the flea "pile" comes over and eats away the flea collar. Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick scream] Run!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Okay! [a flea "cannon" shoots flea "cannonballs." They hit the glass and go back into a pile. The "cannon" shoots "cannonballs" at the three]
Patrick: Wah!
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Sandy: Hey! ["cannonballs" hit the glass and the flea pile grows bigger] Y'all got the aim of a cross-eyed armadilla! [the flea pile grows even bigger and makes the shape of an ocean wave. The three scream] Run again!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Okay! [the flea wave hits the three of them. SpongeBob looks at his arms and they swell with flea bites. Sandy and Patrick swell, too.]
SpongeBob: Aah!
Patrick: Mraah!
Sandy: Aah!
SpongeBob: Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go!
Patrick: Yeah, good to see ya. [they run toward the door, but a flea tornado beats them there. The tornado then chases after them]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Raah! [Squidward is seen walking and listening to some music] Help! Help! Help!
Squidward: Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk. Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.
Sandy: Back off! [Sandy is squishing the fleas by stepping on them, but they overpower her and run her over. SpongeBob and Patrick rush over]
SpongeBob: Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay? [Sandy gets up and spits out fleas]
Sandy: Them varmints is tough. They're from Texas, phew!
Patrick: It's gonna be all right. [picks her up] We will help you. [fleas come down like planes. SpongeBob and Patrick scream, but Patrick angrily points at Sandy] Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas and trouble and pain and itching... and a rash. And pain and fleas and itching and... pain. Soooooo much pain! So much pain. [looks at SpongeBob] And as for you. If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess.
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! You had as much to do with this party as I did!
Patrick: You call this a party? I'm beginning to question [taps on SpongeBob's helmet] our friendship!
SpongeBob: Stop smudging my helmet!
Patrick: Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy!
Sandy: [gets between the two] WOULD YOU TWO MEN STOP YELLING AT EACH OTHER!!! [pushes them to the ground] WHAT DOES THAT PROVE!!?? IF WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THIS, WE GOTTA WORK TOGETHER!
Patrick: You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders. [SpongeBob does so] Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you! [straining to get on top of SpongeBob's shoulders. He sits down] Ahhhh... [munches on an apple, then burps] Ahhhhhhhh. Much better. [the "tower" topples over] Whoa!
Sandy: [annoyed at Patrick's stupidity] I do not play games! [the fleas assemble to make an evil face, then laugh maniacally. SpongeBob and Patrick hold each other in fright] Quick! Get in the tree house, it's the only safe place left! [shuts the door behind her] We should be protected here. [SpongeBob and Patrick look shocked as the tree house rumbles and shakes and fleas enter through the window] Hold on! [Sandy throws an acorn on a button labeled "Emergency Escape Hatch." The floor opens and leads them back outside. Fleas start to take over the treedome, and break the picnic table, and start to cover SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy]
SpongeBob: Is this how we're gonna spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?
Sandy: [her mind pings with an idea] SpongeBob! That's it! Water! [she puts on her helmet and karate chops her way to the door. She opens it, and water starts to fill the dome. Patrick and SpongeBob start to sob, but become happy. Their helmets come off]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Water! [Bikini Bottomites are being sucked into the dome]
SpongeBob: It sure is good to have you back, Sandy.

 
[SpongeBob's alarm rings, his house blows toward Squidward's house, Squidward wakes up in dread, sand hands then cover the house's ears, then SpongeBob, in brown plaid, poses for one second then runs to Patrick's house.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Tee time, Patrick! Patrick! [cuts to Squidward] Tee time, Patrick! [cuts to Patrick's house] Patrick! Wake up!
Patrick: [laughs] Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course. [There is a rumbling sound then storm clouds move in and start rain and thunder]
SpongeBob: Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged. [twist putter]
Patrick: Dumb rain! Doesn't anybody know I'm the sheriff in these parts? [points to sky with putter] Hey, rain! You better stop that! [Patrick gets shocked by lightning then screams. Cuts to Squidward grumbling &amp; covers head with blanket]
Patrick: [continues screaming then gets burned to ashes] AAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Squidward: [opens window] If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sorry, Squidward.
SpongeBob: I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how...
Squidward: Don't care. [closes window, cuts to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. Thanks a lot, rain! [slams fist onto table and makes golf ball ricochet off of door then Gary into Gary's food bowl] Hey, [raises finger]  that gives me an idea. [card comes up saying: BRIEF CONSTRUCTION MONTAGE]
French narrator: What follows is a brief construction montage.
[Shows SpongeBob and Patrick hammering on boards, ripping a sofa, pouring sand, drilling holes, filling holes with water, making holes, and taking Gary's shell off. cuts back to card.]
French narrator: We hope you enjoyed this brief construction montage.
[cuts to outside of house, with sounds and SpongeBob's house shaking. Cuts to inside of Squidward's house.]
Squidward: [grumbles then gets so angry his sleep mask burns off, puts three pillows on a desk, ties them to his face with a rope, still hears them, then rips pillows off and screams. He walks to SpongeBob's house with umbrella, cuts to inside, where SpongeBob and Patrick are constructing] Hey! Hello?! Nitwit, morons. [Patrick hits Squidward with a hammer, Squidward screams]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward. Up from your slumber, I see. Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of [shows course] indoor miniature golf!
Squidward: I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two! Presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap!
Patrick: But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five. [cuts to sculpture]
Squidward: I don't care! Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna...
Patrick: Join us on the back nine?
Squidward: Just don't let it happen again! Or else. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Let's get this game teed off. [balls come out of his head, he catches them, places a ball and tee on grass] You're up first, my good man.
[Patrick stretches, yawns, stomps, ululates.]
Squidward: Would you two KEEP IT DOWN?!
SpongeBob: Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick. Don't want to upset Squidward.
Patrick: Can't wait to lose, huh? [aims, pulls back, and shoots. Ball ricochets back to tee] NO! Ooh. If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot!
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it. [places ball on tee] Besides, we're just playin' for fun, right? And back, and- [makes it]
Patrick: Nice shot. [moves ball]
SpongeBob: What are you doing?
Patrick: Moving my ball.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you have to play it where it lands.
Patrick: Fine. Have it your way. [moves ball back to original place, shoots, makes it] Ready to give up?
[cuts to a hole]
Patrick: Ha! Let's see how you do against the windmill. You haven't got a chance.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, this is just a game.
Patrick: Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win.
SpongeBob: I think you're missing the point. [aims, practice shots]
Patrick: Speaking of m-m-MISSING! [SpongeBob shoots by accident, startled by Patrick] Ha! Gotta play it where it lands. Watch and learn, SquarePants. Watch and learn. [shoots and makes it] YES! See if you can top that!
SpongeBob: [uneasily] Okay.
Patrick: [with microphone and headphones] SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey. [SpongeBob swings but stops] A pressure-packed shot to be sure. [leaves]
[SpongeBob sweats and wipes his forehead and shoots, and the ball stops right before it's about to go in.]
Bikini Bottomites: Aw. [all whisper]
[cuts to hole]
Patrick: Looks like we're tied, three shots to three.
SpongeBob: Shots. [chuckles] They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots.
Patrick: Whatever. [shoots and makes it] AND HE SINKS ANOTHER HOLE IN ONE! That's two in a row!
SpongeBob: All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe. [shoots and makes it] Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now.
Patrick: Watch out for the water hazard.
SpongeBob: Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot.
Patrick: I have no idea what you're talking about.
SpongeBob: Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you. [shoots ball an ball ricochets off of a picture, through a sculpture and out the window] Oops.
Patrick: Show-off. I can do that. [shoots, SpongeBob ducks and goes out the window]
SpongeBob: Oh, where did our balls go?!
Patrick: Well, how do I know? I was just copying you.
SpongeBob: [shows side of Squidward's house and broken window] Uh-oh. Oh well, I guess that's game point.
Patrick: Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet.
SpongeBob: But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise!
Patrick: Who said anything about noise? We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course!
SpongeBob: Hey! Patrick. Patrick! What's the big idea? I thought we were in here to play golf, remember?
Patrick: Okay, okay!
SpongeBob: Now where is that darn ball?
Patrick: Oh!
SpongeBob: Patrick, have you seen my ball?
Patrick: Was it a red one?
SpongeBob: M-hmm.
Patrick: It might have been in the kelp salad.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you ate my ball?
Patrick: Don't worry, I'll get it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, no.
Patrick: No?
SpongeBob: I have to play the ball where it lies. [goes inside Patrick and opens his mouth] You'll need to leave this open. [goes back inside] Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore! [the ball goes through wall and hits lamp] Where's your ball?
Patrick: I don't know. Got to be around here somewhere. [ball is seen on Patrick's butt on the outside of his pants]
SpongeBob: There it is!
Patrick: Uh-oh.
SpongeBob: Play it where it lies.
Patrick: [angrily grumbling. Cuts to him shooting it and ricocheting off a cabinet to a overhead desk lamp, picture, and through a wall] Hole in one! Top that!
SpongeBob: I could do that blindfolded. [Patrick hands him a blindfold]
[cuts to blind SpongeBob. He hits a door. Feels around to identify it and slams the door.]
Patrick: Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot!
SpongeBob: [slams a door] Aha!
Patrick: Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot! [SpongeBob splits a table] Wait, My mistake. You're right. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! SpongeBob, red hot! [kills a plant] Wrong again.
SpongeBob: Patrick... [peeks out]
Patrick: Stop peeking! Hotter. [wrecks Squidward's house along the way] Hotter! Hot! Hot! Cold. Hot. Cold. Hot! Cold.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is ridic- [sees Squidward's wrecked house] -ulous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick...!
Patrick: [in shower] AAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!
SpongeBob: What are you doing?
Patrick: I was just freshening up. But these fancy fixtures are touchy [steam builds up around Patrick] Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold! Cold! [SpongeBob turns off the shower]
SpongeBob: Would you please get back in the game?
Patrick: But I wanted to try his loofah.
SpongeBob: Those balls have got to be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick.
Patrick: Uhh, look a little closer, buddy.
SpongeBob: [uneasily] Play it where it lies?
Patrick: Play it where it lies.
SpongeBob: But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?
Patrick: All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse.
SpongeBob: Okay, you're good to go.
Patrick: Fore! [wrecks top front of house] It's all yours.
SpongeBob: This one's for all the marbles.
Patrick: But I thought we weren't betting.
SpongeBob: No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game. [Squidward wakes up and takes off his blindfold to see SpongeBob and Patrick talking]
Squidward: [muffled] What's going on here? [screams]
[SpongeBob and Patrick shoot, landing Gary's food bowl, spilling on him.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hole in one! [Squidward sits up]
SpongeBob: Good morning.
Patrick: Sorry we woke you.
Squidward: [muffled and stammering] Wha-What? [his mouth is shown, with no dentures]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?
[cuts to Gary, with dentures in his bowl.]
Patrick: Good game, pal.
SpongeBob: Rematch next Saturday?
Patrick: Rain or shine, SpongeBob. Rain or shine.
[stops raining, focusing on Squidward's house, which collapses.]
Squidward: [muffled] SpongeBob?!

 
[Episode starts at Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob is eating ice cream, while Patrick is tanning.]
SpongeBob: This is how to live, isn't it my friend?
Patrick: You said it buddy.
[Larry comes in riding a motorcycle. SpongeBob and Patrick scream, and sand gets in their face. Larry does flips, then rides through a picnic blanket, then pulls one of his breaks causing him to go in circles, getting more sand on SpongeBob and Patrick. He then rides on top of the pile of sand, then through the life guard station causing it to set on fire, and everyone cheers.]
Evelyn: He's amazing!
Frank: I'll say! [Larry then throws a basketball into the hoop, then is about to fall, but he presses a button to cause a sky glider to come out, and he causes the flag on some children's sand castles to catch on fire]
Kids: Whoa! [the sky glider then comes off, and Larry stops. Everyone cheers, then Larry takes off his helmet]
Evelyn: Who is that guy?
Nazz: That's Larry the Lobster. He's like living large!
Nat: What's your secret Larry?
Larry: Well, you've gotta take risks. [Larry hops back on his motor cycle] Live on the edge. [Larry rides his motorcycle, then jumps off at the lagoon. He then gets on someone's surfboard upside down]
All: Ooh! [Larry then comes back to shore]
Larry: And you can't... Uh... You can't... [hears SpongeBob and Patrick whimpering, then picks them up] And you can't live like these two. Just look at 'em. Spineless, [shakes them] weak, [touches them, and they fall] afraid of their own shadows. [They see their shadows, scream, and whimper] Pathetic!
Nat: Larry, how can they redeem their worthless lives?
Larry: I'll tell you how: by living each day as if it were their last!
Patrick: How do we do that?
Larry: By living like me, Larry.
Patrick: But what's that have... [Larry covers his mouth]
Larry: By living, like Larry.
Both: Living, like Larry.
Larry: Living like Larry! [walks away]
Patrick: Living like Larry. Living like Larry. [cuts to later when SpongeBob and Patrick are blowing bubbles. Patrick is sighing, which is like blowing the bubbles] This is bogus!
SpongeBob: What's that Pat?
Patrick: SpongeBob, these are the best years of our lives, and you want to waste them blowing bubbles? We should be living in the moment! We should be living like Lar... [hears sea horses neighing] This is it SpongeBob! This is where we redeem are miserable lives! It's time to start... [jumps in the air, then stops] ...LIVIN' LIKE LARRY! [he then goes back down, and onto the back of a sea horse, and he then rides around] Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob? [SpongeBob is on a kiddie ride outside a grocery store]
SpongeBob: I'm living like Larry! Whoo-hoo! [cuts to later at SpongeBob's house. Patrick kicks the door down, and he is all bandaged up]
Patrick: Where were you SpongeBob? That was awesome! [picks up SpongeBob, and runs outside]
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, where you going?
Patrick: To live my friend! We are going to live! [cuts to "A-1 Wreckers"] This is going to be the best fun yet! [a boat gets smashed from the sides, then from the front and back, then from the top, then a giant spatula puts in a pile of boats, then three flame throwers burn it, then a giant fist comes down and punches it]
SpongeBob: I don't know about this Patrick.
Patrick: You must defeat your reason, before you can start... [jumps up in the air again, then stops] ...living like Larry! [he then goes into a boat] Wo-hoo! SpongeBob, this is it! [he gets smashed from the sides, cringing Spongebob until his stunt end, then cuts back to SpongeBob as the rest happens. Cuts to SpongeBob's house where he is putting the letters of the alphabet on his pairs of socks]
Music: Livin' Like Larry
SpongeBob: De dee do dee do livin' like Larry. Dee dee dee doo livin' like Larry. Deedeedeedee livin' like Larry. [Patrick barges through the door in the boat. He then falls, then breaks out of it]
Patrick: Come on SpongeBob! What are you waiting for? Let's go! [SpongeBob and Patrick run outside. Cuts to later when they are still running]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, where are we going?
Patrick: Just you wait! it's the ultimate! [they run onto a giant ramp that leads into a trench] What do you think? And wait 'till you see the best part! [stomps on the ramp] Hey you guys. [lots of monsters are in the trench. growling and snapping..]
SpongeBob: I don't know Patrick, this looks very danger... [Patrick attaches a skate board on SpongeBob's back, then does so with him]
Patrick: Here's to living like Larry!
SpongeBob: Well, wait a minute Patrick, I think your missing the point. "Living like Larry" doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life.
Patrick: Don't you mean, cost us our lives SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: No Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going.
Patrick: I see. And that's your final word on the subject?
SpongeBob: Mmm-hmm.
Patrick: I feel sorry for you. [goes down the ramp to the trench with all the monsters in it. Scene then cuts to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is working. captions version: I feel sorry for you. screaming. animals growling and roaring..]
SpongeBob: I wonder how Patrick's doing with his "living like Larry" thing.
Patrick: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob looks out the window] SpongeBob! [Patrick is being chased by tough fish on motorcycles. He then runs into the Krusty Krab] You were right SpongeBob! I went too far! I went too far!
SpongeBob: Oh it's okay buddy, I think you learned your lesson. Hmm?
Patrick: Uh-uh.
Tough Guy 1: Don't make us come in there kid! [captions version Gang Member: Don't make us come in there, kid]
SpongeBob: Now you just let me handle those guys out there. [SpongeBob walks outside] Gentlemen, Gentlemen.
All: What the?
SpongeBob: I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look [scene reveals Patrick is a shell] So let me assure you, his days of "living in the moment" are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did? [they thin]
Tough Guy 2: Sure pal. Sure. [Shakes Patrick's hand]
SpongeBob: By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky? [SpongeBob leans on there motorcycles, and they fall]
Tough Guy 2: He knocked over our motorcycles! [SpongeBob laughs nervously, then they chase SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: So scared! Adrenalin pumping! [getting excited] Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo! [gets knocked in the air by a motor cycle] Now I am finally living like Larry! [cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick on top of ballast]
Patrick: Are you sure about this SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh come on Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?
Patrick: I don't know SpongeBob, this looks pretty dangerous.
SpongeBob: [immediately slaps Patrick in the back] Yeah, yeah, you said it buddy! Now we're really living like Larry! [Larry notices them on the ballast]
Larry: Well, would you look at that. Now there's two guys who know how to live!
SpongeBob: Prepare for countdown!
Larry: I'm proud of them. [takes a closer look] Wait a minute, with that angle of trajectory, they'll land right in...Rippers Reef! They'll be ripped to shreds! [runs over with a life preserver with rope tied to it] Wait, don't do it! Stop!
SpongeBob: 3-2-1 Lift off. [pulls a rope, which causes the arrow to set off]
Larry: Drat! [uses the life preserver to catch on to the arrow]
SpongeBob: Whooooo!!! Whoohooooo!!! Whoowoowoo!!! [life preserver catches arrow]
Larry: Whoooooa!!! [climbs rope] Look, guys, my advice wasn't meant to be taken literally! I meant to live life to the fullest, not to maim yourselves! Look! [then notice the reef]
Patrick: Uh oh!
Larry: AAAAAHHHHHH!!!! [shows Rippers Reef then flips back to happy SpongeBob and screaming Larry] AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! [they crash into it, then cuts to scene of them in the hospital]
SpongeBob: What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more. [looks crazy in eyes] What would Larry do?
Larry: [angry] What would Larry do? I'll show you what Larry would do! [chases SpongeBob] Come here! Come here I said! Hey! [chases him off the screen and the episode ends]


[Episode starts when SpongeBob feeds Gary. Then, SpongeBob pours the organic snail food into Gary's food bowl and Gary eats the organic snail food. SpongeBob throws the can of organic snail food by the dirty dishes, and a barrel hits SpongeBob back in the living room and his can of snail food lands on his nose. Gary slithers to him.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay, Gare. I'll get out of your hair, buddy. [pushes his nose and his Krusty Krab uniform hat pops up from his head He walks out the door] See you later, Gare. [Gary is seen holding a leash in his mouth] Oh, you want to go for a walk. Sorry, buddy, I don't have time for a walk right now. Gotta get over the old job. You'll just have to stay here alone, little buddy. But I promise as soon as I get done we'll have fun… together. Okay… …Love you, Gare-bear. Bye. [goes outside &amp; closes the door. Gary picks up a leash. He lassos the leash and opens the top cabinet and gets out a can of snail food and puts it next to them. He lassos the soda drinking cowboy hat and floats it right on top of the chair he slithers towards the chair with the remote in his mouth, while the soda drinking cowboy hat lands on his shell. He turns on the TV as we see a cowboy riding a sea horse]
SpongeBob: Poor little snail just wanted some fun time. [sighs] I can only image the tortured loneliness he must be feeling right now. [walks away, while Gary is watching TV laughing and meowing. Cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is sweeping all the dust from the floor with his broom next to the customer sitting at the table eating a Krabby Patty. Another customer walks in] Welcome to the Kru- [notices that he has a purple pet worm on a leash which barked] Sorry, sir, but the Krusty Krab has a strict no pet policy. I'm afraid your worm will have to wait outside.
Customer: Oh, I could never do that. He gets far too lonely and upset when he's left alone. [to his pet worm] Sorry, buddy, I guess I can't buy you that Krabby Patty you wanted. Let's just go home.
Mr. Krabs: Eh? [walks towards the customer blocking the double doors] Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be hasty. Why didn't ya say you were buying your pet a Krabby Patty? Listen. Tell you what, for your troubles I'll give you two Krabby Patties at regular price. [laughs] SpongeBob, give this responsible pet owner two Krabby Patties. [we hear Gary meow inside SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: Responsible pet owner. I leave Gary alone all by himself all day. I'd better call him just to be sure if he's okay. [walks towards the phone and answers it and calls Gary but no answer] Too distraught to even answer the phone.
Phone: [in SpongeBob's voice] Hello. You've reached SpongeBob and… C'mon Gary. [in Gary's Voice] Meow. [SpongeBob's voice] Gary. [laughs] The two of us are having too much fun together to answer the phone right now. so, leave the massage and will call you right back. Not as long as we take a break and have fun… together! ['SpongeBob &amp; Gary laugh]
SpongeBob: My outgoing message is a lie. [cut to SpongeBob's home where Gary is still watching the TV on the phone] Gary, are you there? Gary, it's SpongeBob. Just checking in. If you're there please pick up…
Gary: [meowing and laughing and drinking a soda in a cowboy hat]
SpongeBob: Just hang in there, Gary, Daddy'll be home soon. [hangs up the phone and sighs. cut to that night where SpongeBob changes the "open" sigh to "closed" sigh and walks out the door where he closes the double doors. Just then we see Mr. Krabs working on the tar machine]
Mr. Krabs: Well, well, well, SpongeBob SquarePants. I was just about to re-tar the parking lot. Why don't you come help me, boy?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'd really love to help, but I've got a lonely pet snail alone at home.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, say no more. You go on home to your pet turtle or whatever.
SpongeBob: Really, Mr. Krabs? You'd let me do that?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, sure just come in five hours early tomorrow to finish up the parking lot.
SpongeBob: You're the best, Mr. Krabs! [cut to SpongeBob running home] Poor Gary must have been left alone. How am I going to keep him happy when they're not alone while I'm at the Krusty Krab?
Timmy: Wow, Dad, is it really mine to keep?
Fred: Sure, son. Now you have a furry friend to give your pet without getting lonely. [SpongeBob stops and sees Timmy with a blue mini eel] And now Daddy can go on his business trips guilt-free.
SpongeBob: Maybe if I get Gary a pal he could play with, he wouldn't be so lonely while I'm at work.
Timmy: Hey, thanks, Dad.
SpongeBob: [runs over there] They're so precious! [we see a bunch of mini colorful and cute eels surrounding the mysterious store owner lady] SOLD! I'll take that one right there!
Store Owner: You wish to have one of my rare and extremely dangerous… huh?
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, this is the one. [picks a green mini eel which is in a small cage]
Store Owner: Beware, boy, this is no ordinary pet!
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary's gonna be so happy!
Store Owner: You must to understand. These pets can be very unstable. especially around other pets! [shows a picture of a cat next to another green mini eel which he growls at it]
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, bye. [walks off]
Store Owner: Why bother? They never listen. [sighs]
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob's house where Gary is still watching TV, drinking a soda from the soda drinking cowboy hat]
Cowboy: [on TV] Sheriff, I've caught the bank robber. [throws a small cowboy hat on the table] There's your culprit right here. Now cuff him. [SpongeBob appears from behind the TV]
SpongeBob: Hello, Gary!
Gary: [Sees SpongeBob by taking off the drinking soda cowboy hat then gets bored] Meow.
SpongeBob: I've brought you a surprise. [takes out a mini green eel from behind his back] Your very own play pal. [sets it on the chair next to Gary] His name is Puffy Fluffy and he'll keep you company while I'm at work. Oh, you two get to know each other. I'll be right back.
[He runs off to get something. Gary meows at Puffy Fluffy, who takes one look at him and snarls. SpongeBob comes back with Gary's food bowl while Puffy Fluffy returns to his cute self.]
SpongeBob: Eat up, you two. [sets food bowl down and pours a can of snail food inside it. Gary slithers to his food bowl and starts to eat but SpongeBob stops him] Gary! What happened to your manners? You be nice and share with Puffy Fluffy. [SpongeBob gets a marker and writes Puffy Fluffy's name with a slash "Puffy Fluffy" on the food bowl] Come here, you. [sets him next to the other side of Gary's food bowl] There you go, Fluffy. Now eat up, I'm gonna go make some enchiladas.
[He walks off; When Gary starts eating his food,  Puffy Fluffy scares him, eats Gary's food bowl and Gary runs and hides behind the wall next to the TV. Puffy Fluffy chases after him and is about to eat him when SpongeBob comes back]
SpongeBob: Done! [Puffy Fluffy returns to his cute self] Oh, these enchiladas are hot, hot, hot! [sits down on the chair and begins to eat when he sees Gary hiding behind the TV, scared] Garold, it is not nice to ignore new friends. [picks up Gary and Puffy Fluffy toward the toys] Why don't you two play a little? That will help you bond. [went back to his chair] Great, now my enchiladas are cold.
[Gary plays with his squeaky toys with Puffy Fluffy when Puffy Fluffy scares him. Fluffy rips the squeaky carrot toy with his sharp teeth onto SpongeBob's enchilada dinner. Puffy Fluffy jaws on Gary, but Gary runs and hops on SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: Gary, what has gotten into you, boy, huh?! [picks Gary from behind his head] Because you refuse to show the least bit of respect for our new friend, and because you have ruined my enchilada dinner, I have but no choice to put you to siesta early tonight. [cut to the living room where SpongeBob puts Gary down on a small bed] I hope you're happy now.
Gary: [doubtful] Meow.
SpongeBob: Good. Maybe you can extend that happiness your new friend. [sets Puffy Fluffy on the small bed and Gary gets scared. SpongeBob covers them up with a small green blanket] Aww, look at you two so cute together.
Gary: Meooooooow.
SpongeBob: I accept your apology, Gary. Now, you be good to him. Good night.
[He walks off to bed when Puffy Fluffy snarls at Gary; cut to SpongeBob going in his bed in his room]
SpongeBob: Ahh. I can rest so peacefully, now that Gary's got a good pal they could play with. [goes to sleep when Gary bursts through the door and runs toward SpongeBob scared]
Gary: [in horror] Meow! [hops on SpongeBob's bed]
SpongeBob: Gary! Shame on you! [takes Gary back in the living room] Puffy Fluffy is perfectly harmless. [takes off the blanket and sees it] See? There he is, fast asleep. Now will you let me sleep, Gary, please? [sets Gary back on a small bed and covers him with a small green blanket] Good night. [He turns off the light and closes the door. Gary looks at Puffy Fluffy but his skin deflates, revealing that it was not him. Just then there's a noise coming from the down stairs kitchen. Gary goes into the kitchen and sees a big green thing behind the fridge eating. Gary slithers over there. It is Puffy Fluffy as a monster, and it roars.]
Gary: Meow!
Puffy Fluffy Monster: Rawr! [sticks out four tongues with large sharp teeth]
Gary: [in terror] Meow! [Cut to SpongeBob who is sleeping. Cut back to Gary slithering toward the oven. Gary looks behind, grabs a pan, and turns around. Gary tries to stop Puffy Fluffy Monster with the pan. Cut back to SpongeBob who is still sleeping. A bit of slobber hangs from his lips as if he were a kid sleeping as lullaby music is heard in the background Cut back to Gary being chased by Puffy Fluffy Monster]
Gary: Mah! [Puffy Fluffy Monster chases him into SpongeBob's library. Gary stops in front of the books, turns around, and sees Puffy Fluffy Monster who's about to eat them. They get away quickly as they can and hides behind a pile of books, as Puffy Fluffy Monster chases Gary around the pile of books and uses his big tail fin and hits the fireplace where the log is. Gary gets away quickly as they can and dodges the fire which burns the library all over the place. Puffy Fluffy Monster scares Gary by the fire. Cut back to SpongeBob who is still sleeping when he sniffs something burning coming from down the stairs]
SpongeBob: [talking to his sleep] Mmmmm. You're making meatballs, Grandma? Time for dinner already? [Cut back to Gary, in the bathroom putting out the fire with a bucket full of water from the tub. The fire is put out]
Gary: Phew. [sees that Puffy Fluffy Monster is ruining several of SpongeBob's pants with his big sharp teeth. Puffy Fluffy Monster roars at Gary, and he screams. Puffy Fluffy Monster spits out several of SpongeBob's torn pants] Meow! [runs towards Puffy Fluffy Monster Who's ruining the library books and tries to stop him on the back with their teeth. Puffy Fluffy Monster looks at Gary trying to stop him with his teeth on his back but he hits him toward the bookshelf]
Gary: Oooow! Mah! [sees Puffy Fluffy Monster who's about to eat him but he jump over him and runs quickly toward the garage he turn around screams and sees Puffy Fluffy about to eat him. Cut back to SpongeBob who is still sleeping and the ceiling is starting to crack and fall. Cut back to Gary who is chased by Puffy Fluffy rushing towards the wall]
Gary: Mah! [being chased by Puffy Fluffy Monster in the living room. Zooms out to SpongeBob's Pineapple house which is shaking. The next morning, the foghorn alarm goes off with the ceiling cracks falling off]
SpongeBob: [mumbles as he rubs both eyes due to the fact that it's morning] Better go check and see how my little buddies are getting along! [notices a piece of cracked ceiling] Hmm, that's interesting. Must have been a sea quake last night. Oh, well, what are you gonna do? [opens the galley door which falls over] That's unusual. Whoa! [sees the library which is a total wreck] My library! [gasps] And my prized memoirs of T.S. Halibut! [gasps] My clothes! [picks up his torn pants] This was no random sea quake. Who could have done this? There was no one here except for... [gets mad] ...Gary. I bet he's jealous about the new friend. [goes down the stairs to the gym door] Gary! You are in big trouble, mister! [tries to open the exercise room door but it's locked] Gary, Gary, unlock this door immediately. Gary, Gary, did you hear?[we see Gary is about to get eaten by Puffy Fluffy Monster which he puts his four long tongues on Gary] Gary? All right, Gary, you have left me no choice! [rushes toward the door, knocks it over. looks up, gasps in shock as he sees Gary about to get eaten by Puffy Fluffy Monster]
SpongeBob: Gary! [to Gary, which he didn’t believe that Gary was getting eaten] You put Fluffy down right now! Bad boy, Gary! [Puffy Fluffy Monster looks at SpongeBob] Bad! Bad! Bad boy! Bad! Bad Gary! Bad! [Puffy Fluffy Monster puts down Gary gently on the floor] I have told and told you and told you and told you and told you and... Oh, hello. Are you a friend of Fluffy? [Puffy Fluffy Monster bites SpongeBob with one of his four long tongues] What's goin' on? Okay, now this is starting to hurt.
Gary: [gets up and sees SpongeBob about to get eaten] MEOW!
SpongeBob: This is exactly what I was talking about--
[Puffy Fluffy Monster shuts SpongeBob up with one of his four long tongues. Gary rushes as fast as he could and comes back with his cowboy gear on when dramatic western music plays. He lassos his leash and hits Puffy Fluffy Monster right in the face and it lets go of SpongeBob covered in monster slime. Gary lassos his leash and puts it through Puffy Fluffy Monster's four long tongues and pulls on ‘em really tight. It rushes outside the house and runs off roaring in pain.]
SpongeBob: [runs out] Fluffy! Fluffy, wait! [Gary slithers to SpongeBob] Well, Gary, what do you have to say for yourself?
[Gary looks at the screen disappointed. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob carries Gary into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Ah, this is more like it. From now on, I'm taking you wherever I go. No more lonely days alone at home. [puts Gary down. Mr. Krabs gasps]
Mr. Krabs: What's that filthy animal doing in me kitchen?
SpongeBob: [laughs] It's me, SpongeBob. I brought Gary along to help out. [puts a Krusty Krab uniform hat on Gary]
Mr. Krabs: Free... labor? Why didn't ya say so? [takes out a spatula] Serve ‘em up, snail! [hands Gary a spatula. Gary sighs]


[Mr. Krabs walks outside of his house, opens his mailbox, and then sticks his claw into it.]
Mr. Krabs: [With his eyes closed] Please be money, please be money. [Pulls out postcard from mailbox.] Oh! That's not money. It's from SpongeBob. [Puts on his glasses, and reads the postcard] "Dear Mr... Krabs, please come to my house tonight. I am having a free money party." Free money party!? This sounds too good to be true!
[Cuts to scene to show Squidward by his mailbox]
Squidward: [Reads postcard] "Dear Squidward, come to my house tonight, I am having a... [surprised] ...latte sipping contest?" This sound too good to be true!
[Cuts to inside of Sandy's treedome]
Sandy: [Reading postcard] "Please come by my house tonight. I'm having a science fair!" Oh, SpongeBob, this sounds too good to be true! [Her science experiment fizzes]
[Cuts to Larry lifting weights]
Larry: [Reading postcard] "I am having a weight lifting competition!?" This sounds too good to be true!
[Cuts to Mrs. Puff at boating school]
Mrs. Puff: [Gasps as she reads postcard] "A quiet evening studying the rules of the road!?" [Laughs] Oh! Ahem... That sounds too good to be true.
[Cuts to the inside of the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: [Reading postcard] "A meeting of the minds to discuss the ultimate downfall of the Krusty Krab!?" This sounds too good to be true!
[Cuts to Mr. Krabs knocking on SpongeBob's door]
SpongeBob: [opens the door] Welcome, friends! Please come in!
[Everyone walks inside]
SpongeBob: I'm so glad you all could make it! Tonight is going to be a magical evening filled with... magic!
Mr. Krabs: Eh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Can we skip the magic and get right to the free money?
Squidward: How 'bout the latte sipping?
Larry: And what about the pumping of the iron?
Plankton: And diabolical conspiracies?
Sandy: And let's not forget the science fair!
SpongeBob: The real reason I called you here was to watch this slideshow of photos from my family vacation!
Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Mrs. Puff, Larry, and Pearl: I knew it was too good to be true!
[Patrick then bursts through the crowd]
Patrick: Ahaha! Ahaha! Sorry I'm late, SpongeBob! I had to find my movie watching hat!
Plankton: That does it... I'm gone. [Plankton starts to leave, but the others exit, and Larry squishes him, followed by Pearl, Mrs. Puff, and Sandy, all stepping on him] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! You're going to miss the first slide! [Clicks button and sticks his tongue out]
[A slide of Patrick appears on the screen next to the wall.]
Squidward: Looks more like a slip than a slide. Ha ha!
Mr. Krabs: I've seen enough.
[They start leaving while Sandy is angry]
SpongeBob: Wait! Come back! [Moves projector] See, it's Patrick!
Patrick: Hey! It's me!
Squidward: Why is it all orange and blurry?
SpongeBob: Where?
Squidward: See, right there on the entire thing!
SpongeBob: Oh! That's because Patrick kept spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz!
[Ripples to SpongeBob taking picture]
SpongeBob: Patrick! You're spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz! The pictures will come out all orange and blurry.
Patrick: I can't help it, SpongeBob! I'm so excited about going on a family vacation with you and your parents that my aim is off! [Patrick sprays himself in the eye with Cheese Fizz.] See? [Patrick blinks, squirting the Cheese Fizz into his mouth and then licks his lips.] There we go...
SpongeBob: I know what you mean. Sometimes it feels like I've been waiting my entire life to go on this trip!
Patrick: Really? Why is that?
SpongeBob: Probably because I have.
Patrick: Have what?
SpongeBob: Been waiting.
Patrick: [Breathing heavily] Wait... you mean so... What?
[SpongeBob throws the camera behind him and then gasps]
SpongeBob: Patrick! They're here!
[SpongeBob's parents pull up in their station wagon. Harold pokes his head out of the window.]
Harold: Good morning son, are you ready to head out?
SpongeBob: You bet!
Margaret: SpongeBob! Don't leave your luggage behind! [points to Patrick]
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's not luggage, it's Patrick! He's coming with us, remember?
Harold: Well, shake a leg, boys. The Great Barrier Reef isn't gonna visit itself!
Margaret: Your father's right, son!
Harold: [Muttering] They know I'm right...
[Cuts to the family driving.]
Patrick: [As SpongeBob pulls out a map] You brought homework?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, it's a brochure detailing all the fun we'll have at our final destination! [opens brochure] The Great Barrier Reef! See? there's a huge assortment of slides, and trampolines...
Patrick: [Drooling] And forts...
SpongeBob: And ropes to swing on...
Patrick: [Still drooling] And forts.
SpongeBob: And a water park! [Camera zooms out, pans to Patrick drooling on map.] Oh wait, that's just where you drooled on it. [Closes brochure] I can't wait to get there! How about you?
Patrick: No, I can't.
SpongeBob: [With his eyes closed] Yeah...
Patrick: [Sweating] No, I mean I really can't. [Shouting] I've been in this confined space for too long, somebody help! [bangs on the car windows] Get me out of here! 
[Cuts to the car driving on the ride with Patrick silently banging on the window.]
Harold: Alright, boys, alright, turn down the volume back there.
Margaret: [Turns to face the backseat] I have an idea! Why don't we play a road game to pass the time?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Maragaret: Anybody know any?
Patrick: [Raises hand frantically] Oh! Oh! Oh! Hide and seek! [Patrick dives under the passenger seat.]
SpongeBob: Hey, why does he get to go first?
Harold: [Singing] "And she threw it all away..."
Patrick: [Flies into windshield] Okay find me!
Harold:  Egad!
[Car spins out of control, crashing into a sign for The Great Barrier Reef. The car crashes in the Outskirts Outlet Mega Mall, bouncing through. The car goes down the escalator, while a tan female fish looks over at the car, and doesn't seem to care. The car then crashes out of the mall, flying through the air, and landing on a race track. The car bounces off of a siren, and then circles the track. The car crosses the finish line, and wins the race. The crowd cheers, and the car crashes through the trophies, exiting the race. The car leaves the ocean, and flies into the air, eventually flying through space. The car hits the cow that jumped over the moon, and falls back down into the ocean. The car crashes between a multitude of rocks, before landing back on the road, and driving away with Patrick now inside.]
SpongeBob: Maybe we should just sing the road song.
Patrick: ♪Road. Road. Road. Road.♪ [Continues for rest of song]
SpongeBob: ♪When I'm on the road, I see stuff going by. When I'm on the road.♪
Patrick: ♪I got a bug in my eye.♪
SpongeBob: ♪When I'm on the road.♪
Margaret: ♪Looks like clear skies ahead.♪
SpongeBob: ♪When I'm on the road.♪
Harold: ♪Please stop touching my head.♪
All: ♪Let's all sing the road song.♪
SpongeBob: ♪I want to sing it all day long.♪
All: ♪Let's all sing the road song. Let's all sing along!♪
[Song ends abruptly when fire starts on top of car. Cuts to show car from the outside.]
SpongeBob: Um... anybody know any other good road tunes?
[Cut to the gang pushing the car, sans Patrick who thinks he is pushing the car, but is not pushing anything.]
SpongeBob: How much farther to the nearest service station?
Harold: Probably pretty far son.
[Cuts to show road sign that shows that the nearest service station is "Proabably pretty far."]
SpongeBob:  Oh, you're right!
[Gang continues to push car, cut to them at a service station.]
Harold: So, uh, how's it lookin'?
Service Station Worker: [Pointing to objects in car] Well, it's got a cracked timing case cover, you've broken a couple keys off the timing gear, your radiator is damaged at the core, you got a cracked water pump, and a fractured injector line.
Margaret:  And what does all that mean?
Service Station Worker:  Well little missy, in technical terms... if she don't wanna run, she don't wanna run!
[Cuts to Margaret and Harold staring blankly.]
Harold: Uh-huh. So what are we looking at time wise?
Service Station Worker: Well now that depends... how much time ya got? [Service Station Worker starts laughing]
Patrick: [Laughing] How much time ya- [All stare at Patrick] Not funny.
[SpongeBob takes a picture.]
SpongeBob:  Hey at least they have a cozy-looking waiting room! [Points to outhouse.] Come on!
[Cut to the gang in the outhouse. Harold is reading the paper and Margaret is knitting. SpongeBob and Patrick are waiting silently.]
SpongeBob: Man, am I bored.
Patrick: I am beyond bored. I am... be...yord.
Margaret: [Looking out window] Oh boys! Is that a playground I see?
[SpongeBob and Patrick stare blankly for a few moments before running to the playground, hollering "Playground!" They slow down upon noticing all the mud around the playground]
Patrick: Not the most colorful playground I've seen.
SpongeBob: Mm-mmm. This looks more like a grey-ground.
Cuts to swings, slide, and see-saw. SpongeBob takes a picture.
Margaret: Well I'll just let you two amuse yourselves and come back for you when the boat's fixed.
SpongeBob: [Turns to Margaret] Actually this place seems a little bit-
Margaret: Have fun!
Patrick: Well this is a nasty turn of events.
SpongeBob: You're preaching to the choir, Patrick.
Patrick: [Crosses arms] I knew it was gonna happen, too.
SpongeBob: You did? How?
Patrick: [Turns around to reveal Cheese Fizz spread across his shorts, reaches into pocket] Because it happens every time I keep my cheese fizz in my back pocket! [Sprays remaining cheese fizz into mouth before running out.] Darn! It's almost empty!
SpongeBob: [Walking towards see-saw] Well, I guess we'll have to make the best of it. [Jumps onto see-saw while laughing.] This is fun! Hey Patrick, you- [SpongeBob's speech becomes incoherent as he sinks into the mud.]
Patrick: [Spraying Cheese Fizz into mouth] Huh? [Patrick walks towards the mud that SpongeBob had sunk into.] SpongeBob, were you talking to me? [SpongeBob reaches his arms out of the mud] I could have sworn SpongeBob was calling me from this direction. SpongeBob, where are you?!
[SpongeBob pulls himself out from the mud by grabbing onto Patrick. Patrick is now sitting on top of SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Huh? SpongeBob? Oh come on, where are you hiding? This isn't funny! [Looking around] Huh. [Puts hands on hips]
SpongeBob: [Pokes Patrick] Patrick, I'm right here.
Patrick: [Looks at SpongeBob] Oh, hey SpongeBob! How'd ya get there?
SpongeBob: Well, I was on this see-saw-
Patrick: [Yelling] Slide! [Bounces off of SpongeBob and onto slide. Patrick laughs and attempts to go down slide, but gets stuck and has to force himself down. The slide gets stuck to his bottom. Patrick tries to pull the slide off, but fails. The slide hits Patrick, and he goes flying.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you need help?
Patrick: [Walks up to SpongeBob with side still stuck] Huh? With the slide stuck to my bottom? Nah, I want it there. [Patrick stands motionless for a second.] I hate you slide! [Pull slide off, flattening SpongeBob. SpongeBob sits motionless on the sand.] Oh, sorry SpongeBob. [Patrick pulls the slide off and throws it behind him]
SpongeBob: [Wobbles back up] Hey look, a swingset! [Flops over to the swings, pulling himself back up] Can't go wrong with this old-time playground favorite. [SpongeBob swings on swingset.] Weee. Hey, this is almost like being at The Great Barrier Reef, huh? Try it, Patrick.
Patrick: Okay. [Patrick sits motionless on swing.] It's not working.
SpongeBob: [Swinging] Go back and forth like this. [Patrick starts swinging] There you go! Now you're getting into the... swing of things! [Laughing]
Patrick: [Starts laughing] Hey, watch me go!
[Patrick breaks the swingset and flies off, screaming]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: [Rolls into fence, breaking it and starts falling down a slide]
SpongeBob: Patrick! I'm coming!
[SpongeBob and Patrick slide down the water slide, screaming, while going down multiple sharp turns. SpongeBob and Patrick end up in a puddle]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: [Muffled] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Patrick! Are you okay?
Patrick: No, I'm not okay.
SpongeBob: You're not?
Patrick: No, I'm great! That was awesome! Let's do it again!
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick, wait for me.
[SpongeBob and Patrick climb up the slide, falls back down]
SpongeBob: Something tells me that is a one-way drain.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick walking through a strange forest.]
SpongeBob: [Groaning] How long have we been walking here, Patrick?
Patrick: Well, that depends on who you ask.
SpongeBob: Why?
Patrick: Well, if you ask someone with a watch, they might be able to tell you. 
[Monster growling]
SpongeBob: Are you getting hungry?
Patrick: Yeah! How'd you know?
SpongeBob: I could hear your stomach growling. For a second I thought it was some scary monster coming to eat us.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
Patrick: That's funny! Couldn't have been my stomach growling though.
SpongeBob: It couldn't?
Patrick: [Poking stomach] Nope. I had its vocal cords removed before the trip.
SpongeBob: Well, I coud've sworn that I heard-
(Monster growling)
Patrick: SpongeBob, I heard it! I heard growling!
SpongeBob: No, that time it was my stomach. There's got to be something around here to eat. [Picks berry and puts it in mouth] Patrick, I found some berries we can- [SpongeBob inflates, body turns purple] not eat!
Patrick: [Patrick eating] Thanks for the warning.
SpongeBob: Patrick, where did you get [Pulls out needle, pops self] the kelp cake?
Patrick: From the vending machine! [Camera pans to vending machine]
SpongeBob: Oh.
[Monster growling]
Patrick: Was it your stomach that time too?
SpongeBob: Nope. ...Run for your life!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run]
[Small creature appears, growls]
SpongeBob: It's getting closer! [SpongeBob and Patrick almost fall of cliff] Oh no! It's a sheer drop-off! What do we do?
Patrick: Don't ask me! I don't remember "being eaten alive" on this trip's itinerary. 
SpongeBob: I'm too young to be digested! [Jumps onto Patrick, crying]
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob! I know how to get us out of this!
SpongeBob: You do?
Patrick: I saw something like this in a movie once! Now watch closely, and do exactly what I do!
SpongeBob: Roger!
[SpongeBob and Patrick jump off of cliff]
SpongeBob: Okay, now what?
Patrick: Uh... I'm not sure, I fell asleep in the second half of the movie!
[Both screaming]
Patrick: Well, I hope that monster's carrying some syrup!
SpongeBob: Yeah, cause if he's eating us, he's having pancakes for lunch!
[SpongeBob and Patrick land on sea anemone, bounce off and land on plant. SpongeBob and Patrick laughing with heavy breath]
SpongeBob: Patrick, we did it!
Patrick: We're not gonna be eaten!
SpongeBob: Hooray for not being eaten!
Patrick: Hooray! [Laughing]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: We're not gonna be eaten! We're not gonna be eaten!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick?
Patrick: All this not being eaten is making me hungry.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry. When we get to The Great Barrier Reef, we'll eat like kings!
Patrick: Alright!
SpongeBob: Alright! Now put 'er there, Patrick!
Patrick: Put 'er there!
SpongeBob: Ooh Patrick, have you been using a different moisturizer? Your hands feel kind of- [Screaming]
[Monster appears behind Patrick]
Patrick: Oh no, it's just the same old moisturizer I always use.
[SpongeBob panicking]
Patrick: Oh, come on, SpongeBob, don't leave me hanging here!
[SpongeBob panicking]
Patrick: Let me guess, it's time to start screaming again?
SpongeBob: Wait a second. [Takes picture] Okay now. [Both screaming and running]
[SpongeBob and Patrick fall, SpongeBob grabs onto a vine while Patrick grabs onto SpongeBob's legs]
Patrick: SpongeBob, as much as I'd like to stay and hang around, I'm not sure now's the time.
SpongeBob: I know Patrick, but now it seems to be- [Hands slip, SpongeBob starts hyperventilating] Our best possible course of action!
Patrick:  [Sweating] Well, I'd probably be really enjoying the view if I still had some blood flowing in my arms. Ow!
[Vine starts to break]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, your patience isn't the only thing that's wearing thin! [Vine breaks, both screaming and swinging on a vine. SpongeBob sees different vine] Grab it, Patrick!
Patrick: Grabbing! [SpongeBob gets sleepy] Okay SpongeBob, your turn! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [Snoring, wakes up and grabs vine] Oh, I got it!
[SpongeBob and Patrick slide through the sand, land behind a rock]
[Monster looks around, shrugs and flies away]
SpongeBob: Whew, that was a close one, right Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, but it looks like everything worked out just... fine... [Patrick laughing]
[Ringing noise]
SpongeBob: Patrick... Patrick, did you hear that?
Patrick: It sounded like it came from the other side of this big rock!
SpongeBob: This isn't a big rock, it's a big wall!)
[Camera zooms out to reveal "no parking" sign on brick wall]
Patrick: Do you think it belongs to that gift shop right there?
[Camera pans to gift shop]
SpongeBob: [Walks up to gift shop] What would a gift shop be doing right in the middle of nowhere?
Patrick: Uh... selling gifts?
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter gift shop]
SpongeBob: [Looking around] Wow Patrick, look at all this stuff! [Taking multiple pictures] You gonna buy something?
Patrick: No, I'm not in the market for any souvenirs.
SpongeBob: Oh, you could never have to many- [Gasps] Oh no! I just realized what this place is!
Patrick: You have?
SpongeBob: Patrick, we have walked straight into a [whispering] tourist trap.
Patrick: A trap!
SpongeBob: Shhh...
Patrick: [Whispering] A trap! 
SpongeBob: [Sweating] Come on. Let's escape, before we spend all our money on useless trinkets.
[SpongeBob and Patrick tip-toeing out of gift shop]
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait, I saw a very nice driftwood sculpture over there that would work great as a mantlepiece.
Patrick: SpongeBob, no!
[Cuts to Patrick spelling his name in the sand, SpongeBob enters crying and carrying multiple shopping bags]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick, that tourist shop took me for everything I had! Now we don't have any money, we're still lost, and we're gonna be in big trouble! Oh, this vacation is a disaster!
Patrick: SpongeBob I-
[SpongeBob bursts into tears]
Patrick: I don't think this vacation has been a disaster.
SpongeBob: You don't?
Patrick: [Picks up brochure, opens] No! Of course not, see?! We did everything we dreamed of doing at The Great Barrier Reef.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're right! We went down a sewage pipe...
Patrick: Like a slide.
SpongeBob: Bounced off a huge anemone...
Patrick: Like a trampoline.
SpongeBob: Hid in a nest!
Patrick: Like a fort!
SpongeBob: And swung on some vines! Which are a lot like ropes! This vacation has it all!
Patrick: [Closes brochure] All except for one thing.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Patrick: A way out of here.
SpongeBob: My poor parents must be worried sick.
Patrick: I suggest we take a nap here until they come and find us! That way we'll be well-rested on the way home.
SpongeBob: [Walking away, Leaving his bags.] I suggest we start walking.
Patrick: I was afraid he was gonna suggest that.
[Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick, singing The Road Song with tired, dry voices]
Patrick: SpongeBob, maybe we oughta take a break from the singing for a while.
SpongeBob: Good idea, Patrick. I'll just play the road song on this whistle I got from the souvenir shop.
[SpongeBob playing The Road Song on whistle. SpongeBob and Patrick passes Harold and Margaret without noticing]
Harold: Oh hey son, we're ready to go.
[SpongeBob continues playing, multiple animals begin to follow as he walks with Patrick through the forest]
Patrick: Wow, SpongeBob, you're pretty good with that thing.
SpongeBob: Well, thanks, Patrick, glad you think so.
Patrick: Apparently I'm not the only one who does.
SpongeBob: What do you mean? Who else could- [Camera zooms out to reveal the monster] Oh no, not again.
[The monster drops to the floor]
Patrick: The whistle seems to have soothed it.
SpongeBob: I think it's offering us a ride!
[fruit fly points to its back]
[cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick on top of the monster]
Patrick: ♪Road. Road. Road. Road. Road. Road.♪ [Continues throughout song]
SpongeBob: ♪When I'm above the road. All I see is sky. When I'm above the road. On a giant fruit fly. When I'm above the road.♪
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: ♪He used to fill us with dread.♪ [Scream]
SpongeBob: ♪When I'm above the road. I'm as snug as a baby bug in bed. Let's all sing the above the road song. I wanna sing it all day long. Let's all sing the above the road song.♪ [Clap Clap!] ♪Let's all sing along!♪
Patrick: Duh.
[Giant Fruit fly drops SpongeBob and Patrick back onto playground]
SpongeBob: Thanks again. Patrick, I think that is the friendliest terrifyingly large insect I have ever had the pleasure of being carried off by.
Patrick: Me too.
[Margaret and Harold pull up in the car]
Margaret: SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!
Harold: Okay boys, the boat is as good as new and we've got miles and miles of open road ahead of us.
Margaret: Boys?
[Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick sleeping]
Margaret: Do something, Harold!
Harold: He's your son, Margaret. He's your son.


[Transitions to the Krusty Krab, which is surrounded by boats. In his office, Mr. Krabs is checking his money records. He hears shouting from outside.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm. Sounds like a mutiny. [he goes outside and gasps] What the...?! [The restaurant is filled with customers shouting angrily] What in Neptune's knickers is this?! [A customer grabs him]
Frank (lifeguard): Where's the dude in the boat, man? Where's the dude in the boat?!
Mr. Krabs: Ooooh! You mean Mr. Squidward. [he turns and points] Well, he's at his post right over the... [the wooden boat is empty] Where's me cashier?! [He looks down at the Frank, who's still holding his arm. He glares at him, and pulls his arm away. Mr. Krabs bursts into the kitchen] SpongeBob! Where in Poseidon's pantyhose is that sorry excuse for a cashier?!
SpongeBob: Sorry excuse for a cash-?" Ooh! You mean Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Yes. I mean Squidward. Where is he?!
SpongeBob: He's in the storage room. Says he's working on something requiring... [in a whisper] ...complete privacy.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. He requires, privacy does he? [the sound of a chain snapping is heard, followed by a loud crash. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs burst into the storage room] What's all the ruckus?! [A shelf has partially collapsed, and there are buns scattered in a heap all over the floor. Squidward emerges from the pile, rubbing his head and groaning. Mr. Krabs gasps] Oh no! Please, no! This is terrible! [he bursts into tears] Are you hurt?
Squidward: Oh, well. Thank you for ask-
Mr. Krabs: I wasn't talking to you! [He picks up some of the buns] Don't worry, papa's here. [he bursts into tears again]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs continues sobbing] Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs sobs even louder] Mr. Krabs! [he stops sobbing] Your shelf collapsed on me, and I twisted my ankle! [He lifts up his tentacle, which is badly twisted]
Mr. Krabs: I didn't even know you had ankles.
Squidward: As if working here wasn't bad enough, now I've been injured on the job.
Mr. Krabs: Injured? On the job?! Oh no! That would mean...
SpongeBob: It's all right here, Mr. Krabs.[Mr. Krabs turns and looks as SpongeBob moves some boxes aside to reveal a poster with "OWS" written on it] The Bikini Bottom OWS Worker Safety Guidelines. Let's see, it says here...blah blah blah blah, accident... blah blah blah blah, owner negligence... blah blah blah blah, substantial fines.
Mr. Krabs: Substantial fines?! [he turns back to Squidward, laughing nervously] You know, Squidward... uh... I can't really let the OWS hear about this, you know. [laughs nervously. Squidward smirks]
Squidward: Really? Maybe I should give them a call. [picks up a phone]
Mr. Krabs: Now now, Squidward! [laughs nervously] Let's not be hasty! [Squidward puts down the phone] I'll take care of your poor little ankle personally. [he turns around] SpongeBob! Squidward needs first aid! [SpongeBob looks delighted]
SpongeBob: First aid? Fear not, injured co-worker, [he runs over to Squidward, now wearing a hospital hat and jacket and a stethoscope] for I am certified.
Squidward: Oh, no no no, don't touch me! [SpongeBob grabs Squidward's nose and runs his stethoscope over it] SpongeBob, would you mind letting go of my nose?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure. [he lets go of Squidward's nose, and it flies back, hitting Squidward]
Squidward: Ow! [he takes the end of SpongeBob's stethoscope and shouts into the end of it] Get away from me! [SpongeBob shakes from the yell and hits his eardrums to make it stop] Well, this is it! I am reporting you to the OWS!
Mr. Krabs: [screams] Please don't report me to the OWS. I'll do anything. Anything at all ya ask.
Squidward: Hmm? Anything? [cuts to scene where Mr. Krabs lays Squidward down]
Mr. Krabs: Now if you want anything, just ask. [laughs nervously then walks away]
Squidward: I could sure use a pillow. [Mr. Krabs comes back to Squidward with a pillow. He places the pillow on Squidward's back]
Squidward: And one more for my foot.
Mr. Krabs: Well, sure thing. [comes back with another pillow which is placed under Squidward's twisted foot] Okay, if that's all, I'll just get back to me--
Squidward: Fluff it.
Mr. Krabs: [angered] What did you say?
Squidward: I said, "fluff it."
Mr. Krabs: [mocking tone] Fluff my pillow, I'll fluff your pillow. [Krabs angrily fluffs the pillow for Squidward]
Squidward: [angered] What's that?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, uh, I said, uh, will there be anything else, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: [relaxes on his pillow] No thanks. That should do it. [Krabs walks away] Oh, Krabsy!
Mr. Krabs: [irritated tone] What can I do for you?
Squidward: Just one more thing. I'm afraid you'll have to take over for me today.
Mr. Krabs: What!? No!
Squidward: Oh, that's too bad. It looks like my twisted ankle might become a 'permanent injury.'
Mr. Krabs: [cringes] Well, that would be an even bigger fine. You just sit back down and relax. We don't want you being injured any further. [chuckles nervously, then walks away] That was close. Well, at least the Krusty Krab isn't very busy today. [anchovies meep] Of course. [cuts to scene where SpongeBob holds a clipboard.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I have the OWS accident report form to fill out. Let's see, Question 1: Was the accident the result of criminal negligence? [Mr. Krabs screams] Mr. Krabs, what is criminal negligence?
Mr. Krabs: [takes the clipboard from SpongeBob] It's what criminals wear to bed. Don't worry about that. We don't need to bother those nice folks over at the OWS. We can do our own investigation. 
SpongeBob: Oh, you mean we should find out if you're criminally negligent.
Mr. Krabs: Well, no, not exactly, what I mean is... [leans towards SpongeBob and whispers] I think Mr. Squidward is hiding something, and I want you to investigate.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Shhhh. [whispering] You gotta keep it a secret from Squidward.
SpongeBob: Can do, Mr. Krabs.
[Cuts to scene where SpongeBob tries to figure out the cause of the accident]
SpongeBob: Hmm? Huh? If I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, I'm gonna need some help. [Cuts to scene where Patrick is shown] Okay, you stand here... [places Patrick next to the shelf, then places a few buns on top] Now, pretend you're Squidward and reach for a bun. [Patrick does so] And I'll simulate the shelf hitting Squidward. [slams the shelf into Patrick, who screams and stumbles around, dizzy, before falling over] Hmm, we seem to be missing something. Well, we'll have to do it again.
Patrick: Uhh, do what again? [cut to outside of the scene] Ow!
SpongeBob: Darn, one more time.
Patrick: Ow! [cuts to scene where Squidward relaxes on Krusty Krab roof. Mr. Krabs comes to the roof with a tea kit in his hand]
Squidward: Oh, Krabsy, after tea, I think a full tentacle massage would be an order.
Mr. Krabs: I ain't touching your tentacles with a 10-ft...
Squidward: [on phone] Hello, Office Workers Safety Department....[Mr. Krabs jumps at Squidward ripping the phone out of his hand, then eats it.]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles nervously] I'll go get the massage oil now. [runs inside; cut to the storage room] Boy, ya got anything?
SpongeBob: Not yet, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs  groans; takes a bucket of fry grease]
Squidward: [clearing throat] I'm waiting!
Mr. Krabs: Coming!
SpongeBob: This just isn't adding up.
Patrick: [sits up] Pudding?
SpongeBob: We must be missing something. Patrick, we're going to need help even more expert than you. [cut to inside the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs massages Squidward's tentacles using the fry grease]
Frankie Billy:  Um, hello? Anybody here?
Mr. Krabs: [angered, muttering] Oh, for the love of peat moss.
Frankie Billy: Anybody at all? Hmm, maybe they're on their lunch bre-- [Mr. Krabs reaches into Frankie Billy's pocket, pulling out the money, walks into the kitchen to prepare a Krabby Patty, then comes out to present a Patty covered in fry grease]
Frankie Billy: Um, aren't you gonna wash your...... [Mr. Krabs shoves the greasy Krabby Patty into Frankie Billy's mouth; Frankie Billy groans in pain as he holds his stomach. Krabs returns to pampering Squidward by continuing to massage his tentacles]
Mr. Krabs: How long do I have to keep this up?
Squidward: Oh, it's gonna be a long, slow recovery. Time to pop my back barnacles. [Mr. Krabs screams as Squidward's back barnacles are shown and then he cries. The customers mutter in anger]
OWS Manager: Office Workers Safety Department. I'm here to investigate the accident.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, no!
Squidward: [sitting up] Oh, yes!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, after all I've done for you, you've called the OWS?!
SpongeBob: He didn't call them, Mr. Krabs, we did. I needed help investigating the accident. Right, buddy?
Patrick: Uh, breakfast, green, Finland. 
Squidward: Well I, for one, plan to give him my full cooperation. [seen in a wheelchair with casts around his head, his arm, and one of his legs] Anything I can do, inspector? [smiles at Mr. Krabs, who fumes with anger; cuts to scene where they all investigate the accident]
OWS Manager: So, this is where the accident occurred. Can anyone tell me what happened?
Squidward: I'll be glad to... [in despair] I mean, I can re-live the whole tragic episode, if I must. [struggles to get up from the wheelchair] It was just another day at the Krusty Krab. I was at the register, giving it a nice shining between orders, when something caught my eye; a patty bun with 10 seeds, instead of 11. I wasn't about to stand idly by and allow a customer go without all his guaranteed nutrients and vitamins. "I must replace it with a proper bun!", I said. I dashed into action.
Squidward: Excuse me, sir.
Frankie Billy: What a diligent and charming individual.
Squidward: That's when I entered the back room to grab a new bun. Just as I was about to reach for one, I heard a slight creek, and that's when the chain snapped, and then, slam! My heroic and brave actions were halted by an unsafe shelf. Disoriented and in pain, I collapsed, and lay for nearly six hours crying softly for help. [crying] Help! H-help! Help.  The worst part, though, is...is that I didn't get that kind gentleman his new bun.
OWS Manager: Hmmm, I see. As you know, certain penalties are involved...
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no...
OWS Manager: [types in random numbers while Mr. Krabs cries] One... Dollar.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps, blinking, wild sobbing, train bell dings] No! Why?! Why, why?! Huh? [scene zooms out to reveal a surveillance camera] What's this? Hold on a second. Me video surveillance camera!
Squidward: [shocked] What?!
Mr. Krabs: I forgot. I, uh, um, borrowed that from the airport. Now, let's see what really happened here. [Mr. Krabs comes back with the recording tape and the TV from the surveillance. Squidward is seen walking towards the bun shelf, but what he does is sleep on it. The chain immediately breaks and Squidward falls unharmed under the buns. Mr. Krabs gasps, then turns to Squidward furiously.] You... f-f-f-f-f-faker! Not to mention you were sleeping on the job! [sighs deeply, forcing Squidward to the ground]
Squidward: What are you going to do to me?
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna make you pay.
Squidward: Oh, no! [cuts to scene where Krabs gets pampered. Krabs sighs. Squidward gasps. When Squidward starts to pop some of the barnacles on Mr. Krabs back, he screams in sorrow.]


Customer: One monster Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: Hmph, no one's ordered the monster Patty in ages. SpongeBob, one monster Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [gasps, shaking] Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!
Squidward: Uh, One monster Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: HUH?! Monster Krabby Patty?!
Customers: Monster Krabby Patty?!
Customer #2: [in bathroom] Monster Krabby Patty?!
[A set of real hands drops a huge meat pile on the grill]
SpongeBob: Oh, dear Neptune.
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: [puts his spatula under the meat] We can do this. At the count of three, we flip. Ready? One, two, three. [Attempts to flip; spatula breaks in half] Spat?
[SpongeBob screams and cries in front of everyone while showing his spatula that is broken/unfixed. The scene cuts to SpongeBob to a therapist.]
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go on. [SpongeBob cries once more.]
[SpongeBob is on a cliff, still crying. Patrick comes up and joins in crying. Switches to an ambulance taking Spatula away, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob quietly watch.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, we better get back to work.
SpongeBob: Work? How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!
Mr. Krabs: Use another spatula'r.
SpongeBob: [close-up of his face, his eyes are hypno-like] WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat! [runs off to the hospital] I'm coming, Spat!
[scene cuts to the hospital where SpongeBob is by a spatula's bed]
SpongeBob: Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together.
[SpongeBob flashes back to all the good times he had with his spatula: flipping patties, laying in the sun with spatula, scratching his back with spatula, playing ping pong with his spatula, reaching under the chair for the remote with spatula, and playing pirates with spatula.]
Doctor: There’s no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula.
[SpongeBob turns around and starts to cry, then turns back around]
Doctor: Go home. Get some rest. We'll try to do everything we can.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: Oh, I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor who's searching for a role. Yes! Woohoo! I am so totally gonna get this part. [gives a sigh of relief]
SpongeBob: [gives a kiss to the spatula and walks out of the hospital] Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that! [notices a sign that says "LE SPATULA INSIDE" and a picture of a high-tech spatula is on it]
SpongeBob: [Thinks] Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this. [walks off then reappears inside the shop in front of the spatula. Thinks] Maybe I do need this. [his eyes are shaped as a spatula]
Doctor: [in SpongeBob's thought bubble] I would give serious consideration to... [bell gongs] a replacement spatula.
[SpongeBob slowly reaches for the spatula, but his hand is slapped away by one of the employees]
SpongeBob: OW!
Employee: Uh-uh! No touchy-touchy the Le Spatula! It is very, very expensive.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry.
Employee: Of course, if you purchase this fine item, you may... hold it.
SpongeBob: I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it? [takes out a bunch of money]
Employee: Umm... [takes out a calculator and punches in many numbers] ...no.
[Scene switches to SpongeBob's house, next to a shelf of piggy banks]
SpongeBob: [breaks a piggy bank with a hammer] How about now?
Employee: No.
SpongeBob: [breaks another piggy bank] Now?
Employee: No.
[Repeat SpongeBob's action and the above two lines for three more piggy banks]
SpongeBob: [lifts up Gary's shell where there is a big diamond under it] Now?
Employee: No.
SpongeBob: [sells his house] That's everything I have. Now can I buy Le Spatula?
Employee: Everything, huh? [Looks at SpongeBob clothes] Nice outfit.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street nude where everyone is looking at him in shock]
SpongeBob: Evening, sir. Hey, granny, what's shaking? [walks into the Krusty Krab, passes Squidward] Ooh, breezy today.
Squidward: [Snickers] Nice outfit, SpongeBob! [laughs hysterically]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny.
Mr. Krabs: What's all the lallygagging about?
Squidward: [still laughing] Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: This better be good. [walks into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Soon, everyone will know of your beauty.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, what's going on in [sees SpongeBob naked] ...ooh... Don't you have any shame, boy?
SpongeBob: All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs. [shows Le Spatula]
Mr. Krabs: Le Spatular! What in blazes is that?
SpongeBob: Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma. [Le Spatula glows]
Mr. Krabs: Well, what can it do?
Squidward: Can it make me famous?
SpongeBob: Anything you want and more. [pushes a button and the spatula spins]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, that sounds exciting. Let me have a go at it. [Reaches for Le Spatula]
SpongeBob: [Holds Le Spatula away from Mr. Krabs' reach] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] What? Are you going against your commanding officer?
SpongeBob: No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.
Mr. Krabs: With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact... [pushes a button and a bunch of spatulas appear]
Le Spatula: [says mechanically] Le Spatula 3000 at your service!
Mr. Krabs: Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket. [laughs and walks away with Squidward]
SpongeBob: Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show ‘em, buddy? [all the spatulas go into hiding] Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job. [scene cuts to outside the kitchen]
Wobbles: Uh, can I get one Krabby Patty, please?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [back in the kitchen] One Krabby Patty, coming up lickety split. [tries to use Le Spatula, but every time he tries to flip the patty, the spatula goes another direction] Spat, is there something wrong, pal?
Le Spatula: I would not dare touch such slop as this, how you say, Krabby Patty. I am designed for the up most interesting cuisine. No less!
SpongeBob: But, but, I thought we were friends.
Le Spatula: Friends with you?! Ha! We are not even in the same social class. [jumps out of SpongeBob's arms and extends it legs to land on the floor] Have a nice life of mediocrity, fry cook! [runs out laughing]
SpongeBob: Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something. [Le Spatula punches SpongeBob in the face]
Le Spatula: How's that for something? Au revoir, peasants! Have fun laboring in your greasy spoon. [spits and runs out]
Mr. Krabs: What happened?
SpongeBob: Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.
Mr Krabs: Well, how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULAR?!
SpongeBob: I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!
Mr. Krabs: I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.
Mr. Krabs: Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers. [starts to cry; scene cuts to the spatula's hospital bed from the start of the episode, with the pulse meter slowing, then becomes a flat line]
SpongeBob: Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late! [cries]
Doctor: SpongeBob, I hate to tell you this...
SpongeBob: I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone! [sobs]
Doctor: Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm so sorry. [cries more]
Doctor: Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary. [scene pans over to the Infirmary where Spat is in a wheelchair]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Spatula! [runs into the infirmary] Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better! [Spat turns around and ignores SpongeBob] Spatula, what's wrong? [spatula shakes its head] But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?! [begins burst into tears loudly and rolls. As he is doing this, another SpongeBob comes up into the scene]
SpongeBob: [in a monotone voice]&#160;: All that glitters is not gold. [as SpongeBob is still crying loudly, spatula wheels itself away]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, best friend!
[SpongeBob crawls crying all the way to the Krusty Krab kitchen]
SpongeBob: I'll never find another spatula like him again. [notices a spatula flipping patties by itself] Spatula? You're back! [SpongeBob jumps for spatula in slow motion, camera cuts to outer space] Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.
Squidward: One monster Krabby Patty. [the same real set of hands put a bunch of meat on the grill as before]
SpongeBob: Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? One, two, three. [SpongeBob's arms come off] D'oh! [laughs]


[The episode begins at a beautiful morning at SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: [bouncing up and down on the bed] Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [continues bouncing] Oh, Gary, I'm so excited! [jumps off] Tonight, they're showing the only episode of "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy" that I've never seen! Whoo-hoo!
Gary: Meow, meow!
[SpongeBob carries Gary to the bathroom and squirts Tooth Toothpaste on his toothbrush.]
SpongeBob: It was lost...[pulls out his dentures and brushes them] to the sands of time. [put his dentures back in his mouth; he and Gary jump in the bathtub and SpongeBob scrubs himself] Until they found a copy in the producer's underwear drawer. [pulls lever and the tub flies them into the wringer]
Gary: Meow.
[SpongeBob lands in his pants and Gary lands in his shell.]
SpongeBob: [shows Gary the poster] It's part two of the two-part special, "The Case of the Curious Cliff Hanger." Well, I've rearranged the living room for optimal TV viewing. [shows the living room all set for his television viewing]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: [shows the popcorn machine] The popcorn's a-popping.
Gary: [gets hit in the eye by a popcorn kernel] Meow.
SpongeBob: [shows several soda bottles in a frozen ice block] And the soda's on ice. All that's left is to set the VCR to record [sets up the VCR to record] so I can relive the magic over and over forever. [his teeth roll around in his mouth like movie film] Hmm, but which tape to use? Don't have any blank ones left. Hmm. [picks a tape that views his own birth] Oh, here we go. Who needs a tape of their own birth, anyway? [puts the tape in the VCR] Yoop, done! [puts on his Krusty Krab working hat] Now it's just one quick shift at the Krusty Krab, and I'll be back for the evening's entertainment. [laughs as his bubbles form into a laughing mouth]
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob is growing impatient.]
SpongeBob: Normally I like working, but today is moving [close-up of his face in slow-motion] so slowly.
[SpongeBob peaks in through the kitchen window and sees everything moving in a slow pace. Two customers are chewing their food real slow. Nat bite his Krabby Patty, but slaps Fred in the face, making him spit out his food. Patrick opens his mouth and eats the food. SpongeBob sulks and slides back in the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Oh, at this rate I'm never gonna see "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy." [groans]
[SpongeBob flips some patties and forms them into the faces of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.]
SpongeBob: Hmm?
Barnacle Boy Patty: We'll help you get through the day, SpongeBob.
Mermaid Man Patty: And tonight we'll conquer evil!
SpongeBob: Aw, you guys always make me feel better. [leans on the grill and burns his arms] Hmm? [removes his arms from the grill and they disintegrate; he laughs]
French Narrator: One Shift Later...
[Mr. Krabs is counting money and Squidward is manning the register. SpongeBob bursts out from the door and runs past them in a fast pace, leaving a trail of fire and leaving Mr. Krabs in his underwear.]
SpongeBob: All right, bye, Squidward! Bye, Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] See you tomorrow! [bumps into Mrs. Puff's boat]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, SpongeBob. My boat has a flat tire. Could you help me change it?
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, well, [points to his watch] I gotta get home for "Mermaid Man," but—but sure, I guess I have a little time.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, good. Let me know when you're done. [picks up a mug of coffee and a book entitled, "Gone with the Fin"]
SpongeBob: Luckily, I brought all my tools. [pulls his tie, opens his head and shows a variety of tools] Jack, wrench, hammer, jackhammer—[activates jackhammer and drills in the ground] Whoa! [comes back out] Jack-wrench, wrench-hammer, hammer-hammer. Okay, I'm ready!
[SpongeBob goes underneath Mrs. Puff's boat, levers it up like a jack, and pulls out a pair of scissors.]
SpongeBob: Gotta get that old tire off. And... [cuts the tire into paper dolls and laughs; goes to put a new tire on] Yes? No. Maybe if I try...[groans]
[SpongeBob struggles to put the tire on the wheel, but it slips off and is sent flying to the surface.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Ah-ha!
[Mrs. Puff sleeps until she feels her boat moving.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mrs. Puff. Good to go.
[Mrs. Puff drives her boat to her house. She looks down at her wheel and sees SpongeBob implanted himself onto it.]
Mrs. Puff: Thanks again, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, no problem, Mrs. Puff.
[SpongeBob is beaten up from getting crushed by the rocky roads. He pokes a hole, deflates, and flies everywhere. He then looks at his watch.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. I still have time to get home before my show, if I pick up the pace. [runs straight to his house] Ah, home sweet pineapple!
Patrick: Hey, buddy! You got a minute?
SpongeBob: [pops his face out from his back] Oh, uh, not really, but—
Patrick: I double-parked my rock, and it got towed. [shows his spot where his rock was and a sign says "No Rock Parking"] Could you help me get it back?
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, sure. Uh, but let's make it quick. "Mermaid Man" is on soon.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick at the Impound Yard.]
Impound worker: You'se guys can take a look around on your owns. [opens door]
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the junkyard and sees that everything looks exactly like Patrick's rock.]
SpongeBob: They all look the same, Patrick. How are we gonna find your rock?
Patrick: Don't worry, buddy. I'll know it when I feel it. Oh, this might be it! Give me a hand!
[SpongeBob lifts the rock up with all his might. Patrick rolls underneath and SpongeBob drops it.]
Patrick: Ow! No, this isn't it. Oh, ooh, this one might be it!
[SpongeBob lifts another rock and Patrick slides underneath it. SpongeBob drops it on Patrick.]
Patrick: Ouch! No, this isn't it either. Ow! No. Ow! No. [shouts] No. [screams] No.
[SpongeBob holds up the last remaining rock up for Patrick. Patrick slides underneath it and SpongeBob drops it on him.]
Patrick: [sighs] This is it. This is my rock!
Impound worker: Congratulations. Now there's a little matter of the fee.
Patrick: Oh, talk to him. [picks SpongeBob up and hops on his rock]
SpongeBob: [hands the impound worker money] Here you go.
[The impound worker takes the money and leaves.]
Patrick: [begins driving away with his rock] Thanks, SpongeBob! See you at home for "Mermaid Man!" Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, Patrick! Could you give me a...ride? [groans and a rock crushes him]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob running past Sandy's treedome.]
Sandy: SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. I could really use your help.
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Sandy. Uh, I'm kind of in a rush 'cause "Mermaid Man" is on and it's the lost episode—
Sandy: Oh, it won't take more than a minute.
[SpongeBob looks at his watch and groans.]
Sandy: My laser acorn experiment blasted a nut-sized hole in my dome. Could you stick your finger here while I go get my fix-it-up kit?
SpongeBob: I don't really have a lot of time to—
Sandy: [plugs the hole with SpongeBob's finger] Thanks, be right back! [runs into her dome]
[SpongeBob sees two unnamed kids passing by.]
Kid #1: Gosh, I can't wait to see that long lost "Mermaid Man" episode tonight.
Kid #2: Oh, for sure. No real fan would miss it. Not for the world.
[SpongeBob panics and struggles to break free. Sandy comes back out with her fix-it-up kit.]
Sandy: All righty, SpongeBob. I'm ready to—What? [sees his hand dangling where the punctured hole is]
[SpongeBob regenerates his arm and runs to his house as fast as he could.]
SpongeBob: That's it! No more distractions! I am gonna—[gets grabbed by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Boy-o, you gotta help me sort me loose change!
SpongeBob: But "Mermaid Man."
[Mr. Krabs dumps a bucket full of coins over SpongeBob's head. The coins come out in tiny little coin rolls. Mr. Krabs places the coin rolls in his bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, boy-o!
[SpongeBob gets up, looks at his watch and panics. He runs out of Mr. Krabs' house, leaving a trail of coins behind.]
SpongeBob: [panting] Don't wanna miss it! Don't wanna miss it! [gets stopped by Larry who wants to have him put tanning lotion on his back] But "Mermaid Man." [then he's asked to help change light bulbs with Plankton at the Chum Bucket] But "Mermaid Man." [then he's asked to help plant vegetables in Squidward's garden] But "Mermaid Man." [shows him giving a line of senior citizens a foot massage at Shady Shoals] But "Mermaid Man." [shows him being a crossing guard in Bikini Bottom to help people cross the street] But "Mermaid Man." [shows him helping the Flying Dutchman mop up the deck on his ship] But "Mermaid Man."
[The scene changes to nighttime. An exhausted SpongeBob walks up to the front door of his house.]
SpongeBob: [sighs and looks at his watch] Well, I may have missed the live broadcast, but at least I got it all on tape. Here I come, "Mermaid Man!" [tries to open the door but it's locked] Oh. [tries to pull it open but to no avail; he checks his pockets] Where'd I put my keys? [peaks through the window] Did I leave them on the table again? [sees his VCR going haywire and it spits out the tape's film] No, my tape! [the ice block explodes and soda flies everywhere] My soda! [the popcorn machine explodes] My popcorn! [sees everything a complete mess] My "Mermaid Man!" [the house bursts into flames and he screams]
[Gary gets shot out of the house on a flying soda bottle. SpongeBob goes to catch Gary, but he lands on his face.]
Gary: Meow. [slithers off of SpongeBob]
[SpongeBob, completely shocked at what happened, started feeling really sad and begins to cry. His crying was so loud and powerful that it was heard all across Bikini Bottom, which resulted in waking the townsfolk up. Moments later, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, Larry, Mr. Krabs, Plankton and Mrs. Puff arrive to see what was the matter.]
Sandy: Hey there, SpongeBob. Why all the waterworks?
SpongeBob: [sniffles and wipes his tears with his nose like a windshield wiper] I was so busy helping everyone that I missed "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy" and my VCR didn't record it and now I'll never see it and my life has no meaning!
[SpongeBob sulks away from his friends and goes back into his burning house in tears, now that his chances of seeing the long-lost episode of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy has been shattered. All of SpongeBob's friends including Squidward look on at him with sad faces and realized what they had done: they took his kindness for granted and inexplicably ruined his chances of seeing the episode he's been looking forward to watching.]
Sandy: All right, listen up. SpongeBob has helped every single one of us dozens of times over. But we ain't been very helpful to him today.
[All of his friends murmur in agreement.]
Patrick: Yeah, I was a lousy friend.
Sandy: Now, we may have taken advantage of his kindness, but I got a plan to make things right.
[They hover together and Sandy quietly explains her plan in hopes of making up to SpongeBob for letting him miss the show.]
French Narrator: The Next Day...
[The scene changes to the next morning. SpongeBob's living room is a complete mess and is covered with burnt popcorn and soda bottles. SpongeBob goes into a state of deep depression and holds out a burnt videotape. He drops the tape and moves his finger around.]
SpongeBob: Play… [drinks a bottle of burnt soda and eats some burnt popcorn]
Sandy: [knocks on the door and peaks through the window] Hey there, SpongeBob. Feeling any better?
[SpongeBob mutters in depression.]
Sandy: Aww, [jumps in through the window] why don't you come with me? I have a little surprise for you.
SpongeBob: I'm not really in the mood, Sandy.
Sandy: Aww, quit acting like a calf with colic. [pushes SpongeBob out with his chair] Come on, SpongeBob. [pushes him to a television-themed outdoor amphiltheater]
SpongeBob: Gee, Sandy, where'd you get an outdoor amphitheater?
Sandy: Don't worry about that. Just sit right here and enjoy the play.
SpongeBob: Oh, okay.
[Plankton comes out from the curtains and knocks the microphone over so he can speak into it.]
Plankton: Welcome, ladies and morons! It's time for the exciting conclusion to...[the curtains open] "The Case of the Curious Cliffhanger!" [laughs]
SpongeBob: [wakes up from his depression] Huh? Whoa! [laughs and pulls his chair forward to watch it closer]
[On the stage, Squidward is dressed as Doctor Negative, Mrs. Puff is the Atomic Flounder, Gary is the Dirty Bubble, Larry is Mermaid Man, and Patrick is Barnacle Boy.]
Larry: Help me, Barnacle Boy. I'm hanging...from this cliff.
[A cardboard cloud falls down.]
Patrick: And look, I am also hanging from this cliff. We sure are in danger.
[SpongeBob covers his eyes, but pop them out through his head to see. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs as Captain Tightwad fighting against Larry as Mermaid Man.]
Mr. Krabs: [grunts] You should give up while you can, Mermaid Man.
[Squidward struggles to hold Mr. Krabs up, but ends up swinging him up and down.]
Larry: Haven't you heard, Captian Tightwad? I'll never give up fighting...um...Line?
Mrs. Puff: [struggling to hold Larry up] Oh, um...[looks through the script book and whispers] Evil.
Larry: Evil!
[Three cannons steam smoke out at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs falls to the floor and Squidward falls on top of him. The curtain closes over Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Wow! Yes, yes!
[The scene changes to the play's grand finale. During the finale, Sandy is dressed as Miss Appear and Plankton is wearing a Man Ray helmet. The rest of the cast remain as Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, the Atomic Flounder, the Dirty Bubble, Doctor Negative, and Captain Tightwad.]
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪He may be half a mermaid!♪
Gary: ♪Meow!♪
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪And he may be half a man!♪
Gary: ♪Meow!♪
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪But to us he's more than a hero!♪
Gary: ♪Meow, meow!♪
Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Plankton, and Mrs. Puff: ♪He's our Mermaid Man!♪
[Plankton pushes the button on the remote and ignites fireworks for the finale as Larry makes Mermaid Man's hero pose.]
SpongeBob: [sheds a tear and whistles] Ah, oh, bravo! Bravo! Bravo! [laughs as he bounces around in happiness] Yes! Ah! [flies onto the stage like a rocket] Thank you, everyone! [hugs all of his friends] I loved the show! And I loved the love you showed me! And I love how you showed me the love you showed me in the show I love. [his eyes widen] This is my favorite episode of "Mermaid Man" ever!
[SpongeBob and all of his friends cheer in happiness. Just then, Old Man Jenkins arrives on the stage.]
Old Man Jenkins: Hey! What are you kids doing in my outdoor amphitheater?
Sandy: [screams] Cheese it, everyone! It's Old Man Jenkins! [screams]
[Everyone, except SpongeBob, run off the stage.]
Old Man Jenkins: Come back! I just wanna be in the play.
SpongeBob: Aww, I'll play with you, Old Man Jenkins. [hands Old Man Jenkins a purple starfish] Do you wanna be Mermaid Man?
Old Man Jenkins: It's the role of my dreams! [places the starfish on his face and flies in the sky] Zoom! [laughs] Whoo!
[SpongeBob laughs and the screen turns black, ending the episode.]


[opening shot of The Krusty Krab]
Narrator: Ahhh... The Krusty Krab, Bikini Bottom's answer to fine dining. And here we see one of its patrons now. [Patrick runs away from the back of the Krusty Krab dropping grease across his path] Ah... yes, moving on. Oh, it is the SpongeBob, creator of the fine cuisine within. Now let us watch.
Squidward: One Krabby Patty, extra grease. [SpongeBob chuckles and flips a page in his book.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! 
Squidward: Mmm.
SpongeBob: Ooh! [he starts laughing] 
Squidward: [growls] 
SpongeBob: [he laughs more and flips a page] [Gasps and moans]
Squidward: Grr...
SpongeBob: [he gasps again and laughs even more]
Squidward: All right, let me see it. [he picks up the book that SpongeBob was looking at] The Krusty Krab work schedule, what's so great about this?
SpongeBob: [gasps] What's so... why, it's my happy book. The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred.
Squidward: Hmmm... [drops SpongeBob's book] Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. [walks to his cabinet and opens it] I have a whole cabinet of backups. [Squidward deflates] So what's your happiest memory, Squidward?
Squidward: Ummm, let me think...  [thinks of TV static and color bars screen] [sighs] I guess I don't have a happiest memory. Oh, well. [walks away]
[SpongeBob thinks and he pops out from Squidward's boat]
Squidward: Yes?!
SpongeBob: Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?
Squidward: So what?
SpongeBob: How can you live without a happiest memory? Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?
Squidward: I hear you crying all the time.
SpongeBob: Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy.
Squidward: Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone.
Sandals: Hey, I'd like to order a Krabby Patty, please. [Squidward bursts into tears] Okay... can someone else take my order?
[SpongeBob appears from Squidward's boat again and cries with him.] 
Sandals: [annoyed] I'll wait.
[SpongeBob continues crying.]
Squidward: [crying] You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory. This is horrible!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory.
Squidward: [sniffs] Really? Do you think you can?
SpongeBob: [puts his arm around Squidward] No problem.
Squidward: Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay. [SpongeBob squeals with excitement]
[At a concert, a song plays.]
SpongeBob: You love music, right, Squidward?
Squidward: Mmm hmm.
SpongeBob: Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!
Squidward: Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I actually feel kinda...happy!
SpongeBob: See? Your happiest memory is forming!
[Nat plays his violin but his bow launches from it]
SpongeBob: Oops. That was a sour note. [Notices the violin bow on Squidward's eye]
Squidward: This is not my happiest memory...
[Bubble transition to the Museum]
Squidward: Why are we at the Art Museum?
SpongeBob: Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!
Squidward: Great... I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed. My art will never be shown in this... [Walks into a statue resembling him]  What the? This... this is my sculpture! How did it get here?
Curator: [Walks up to Squidward's sculpture along with a group of fish] Oh! You're just in time! Art lovers, this is Squidward Tentacles! Creator of this piece! [The group is in awe]
SpongeBob: Wow! Your work at a museum Squidward!
Squidward: [Excited] Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!
SpongeBob: Your happiest memory?
Squidward: Yeah!
Curator: And now the performance artist Fiasco will say a few words about this piece [camera shifts over to Fiasco]
Squidward: Gosh! Fiasco himself is talking about my art!
Fiasco: Ahem! Squid... ward... go toward... the light... [takes out a flamethrower] of my flamethrower! [burns down Squidward's sculpture and the Art Critic's group claps for him]
Squidward: And now he's melted it... [Fiasco takes away the sign "Created by Squidward Tentacles" and replaces it with "Burned by Fiasco"] Not a happiest memory...
SpongeBob: Um... it's kinda smokey in here! [grabs Squidward's arm] You need fresh air!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward (who is blindfolded) in a hot air balloon]
SpongeBob: What a majestic view!
Squidward: What view?
SpongeBob: Oh yeah! I forgot about your blindfold! [removes Squidward's blindfold] Isn't it beautiful?
Squidward: [looks down at his house] Very nice... except that I'm [scared] afraid of heights!
SpongeBob: Oh! Sorry Squidward! I'll take us down! [takes out a needle]
Squidward:  What?! No! [SpongeBob pops the balloon] Oh boy... [he and SpongeBob start flying around and crash into a mountain. he knocks away the basket and notices SpongeBob's behind] Oh yeah...nice view...
Harold: [reaches the top] Son of a seahorse! Twenty years of training and a couple of amateurs just leap out of a balloon! Here! [gives SpongeBob his flag] You plant it! [walks back down] All that time and money and resources wasted on...
SpongeBob: Hey! We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt. Bikini! Surely that makes for a happiest memory! I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles! [accidentally jams the flag onto Squidward's foot]
Squidward: [removes the flag from his foot and notices the mountain starting to shake] Uh oh...[the snow starts to carry him and SpongeBob down the mountain]
Harold: Stupid amateurs... [stops walking and notices the snow] Fantastic... [the snow carries him, SpongeBob, and Squidward onto Conch Street]
Squidward: Time to face facts. I'll never have a happiest memory. [opens the snow up like a door and walks out then turns to SpongeBob] And if I do, it definitely won't involve you. [closes the snow door on SpongeBob and locks it; then walks inside his house and closes the door] Hello misery... I'm home... [walks up the stairs and gets on his bed] I might as well go to bed for a hundred years or so. [lays down in bed] Wake me when I'm dead... [rolls under his bed and sighs]
Narrator: Two weeks later...
SpongeBob: [at his house] Gary, I am worried about Squidward. He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!
Gary: [meows]
SpongeBob: [knocks Squidward's door] Why isn't he answering? [looks through Squidward's mail slot] Squidward! Squidward! Now I'm really worried! Squidward! Squidward! [notices Squidward through the window] Gasp! Squidward! Down here! He's upstairs! [near Squidward's window will sitting on top of Gary; then knocks on the window] Hey! Hey! Squidward! [Squidward pulls the blinds down on both windows] Well at least we know that he is still alive. Uh oh... [Gary's shell falls off and SpongeBob lands on the ground; then runs into Squidward's house and Gary's shell cracks off of him] I'm okay Gary!
Gary: Meow...
[bubble transition to inside SpongeBob's house and near the phone]
SpongeBob: Squidward sure seems depressed. I think I'll call him to cheer him up! [starts calling Squidward and he picks up the phone] Hello? Squidward? Are you there? [Squidward throws his phone out his window and into SpongeBob's house] Squidward? Are you there? Squidward?
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Gary? What are you doing at Squidward's? Uh Gare? Can you put Squidward on the phone? [Notices Gary trying to give him another phone and takes it] Hold on a second, someone is on the other line. [echoing] Hello? Hello!? Hello!? [Squidward's phone breaks] Hello? [his phone then breaks]
Squidward: I just can't seem to get happy... [opens his oven and takes out burned food] Well, that didn't help... [hears ringing; then walks over to his phone] Huh? That's strange, I could have swear I just threw that darn phone away. [notices his fax machine] Oh yeah. My fax machine. Now, why did I buy that again?
SpongeBob: [emerges from the fax machine and is in paperized form] Hi, Squidward! [Squidward grabs him] You sure are a hard man to get a hold of! [sniffs] Hey, do I smell brownies?
Squidward: Yes... [tosses SpongeBob into the paper shredder and picks the box up] Thanks for stopping by. [dumps SpongeBob out of his window then closes it]
Gary: Sigh... meow. [gathers up the bits of SpongeBob and puts him back together]
SpongeBob: Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!
Squidward: [grabs a rope] I can't seem to get happy... [swings the rope over] Maybe this will help. [pulls on the rope to reveal a scallop in a cage but it sprays unknown liquid at him and the cage falls on his face; the scallop then flies away] Nope... I guess not... [hears knocking] Oh great... I wonder who that could be... [looks through the mail slot and notices the Mailfish] You're not SpongeBob.
Mailfish: I have a package for a Squidward "Tentaclees"?
Squidward: "Tentacles". Yes that's me.
Mailfish: Well, here you go. [gives Squidward the package]
Squidward: Thanks... [closes his door] Doesn't say who's it from. No doubt SpongeBob is hiding inside. Ah well, here goes nothing. [opens the package] Gotcha! Huh? [notices it empty] It's empty. Empty, just like my miserable life! [SpongeBob emerges from the box] I see nothing but darkness ahead... [SpongeBob taps him in another box] SpongeBob!? [starts muffling as SpongeBob takes him to the Krusty Krab; SpongeBob then opens the box]
SpongeBob: Surprise! I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up! Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick but don't worry! I used my paper mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me! [camera zooms out to show the Krusty Krab filled with paper mâché SpongeBobs] So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?
Squidward: You don't seem to understand. [starts to get angry] I... don't... want... a... happiest memory! [starts to go crazy and destroys the cake]
SpongeBob: [talking to a paper mâché SpongeBob] So you enjoying the hors d'oeuvres?
Squidward: [rips the paper mâché SpongeBob apart then saws more apart; then crawls to the ceiling and grabs the banner that says "Happy Happiest Memory Squidward" and kicks more of them away] I feel wonderful! [Laughs maniacally and destroys more paper mâché SpongeBobs] This is it, my happiest memory!
SpongeBob: Sigh... he's so handsome!


Mr. Krabs: [Looks around the Krusty Krab with a telescope] Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I'll surely break out in a rash!
SpongeBob: Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, I saw it first! Hah! [Jumps onto table and sweats] Mine, mine! Huh?!
SpongeBob: Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Where are the doubloons?
SpongeBob: [laughs] There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: "The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt".
Patrick: Based on a real treasure map.
SpongeBob: Take a break and play around with us.
Patrick: Yeah! C'mon, sweaty!
Mr. Krabs: Have you finished cleaning the tables?
SpongeBob: I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
SpongeBob: [chewing gum along with Patrick] I already took care of it.
Mr. Krabs: Hahaha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Five! [makes raspberry noise while moving piece. Reads card] One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm... [SpongeBob turns his eyes toward Mr. Krabs] It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Patrick, you're fired.
Patrick: But I don't even work here!
Mr. Krabs: Would you like a job, starting now? [puts hat on Patrick's head]
Patrick: Boy, would I!
Mr. Krabs: [takes hat off Patrick's head] You're fired.
SpongeBob: My turn. [rolls dice] One, two, three, four. [picks up card and reads it] Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way. [looks through the hole in the tree] Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Shiver me timbers!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
SpongeBob: [picks up card and reads it] You are a real pirate. Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Treasure. [digs and mini plastic treasure chest appears] There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. [starts sweating profusely]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
Fred: [walks into The Krusty Krab] Rev up those fryers, ‘cause I am sure hungry for one-- [Mr. Krabs picks him up, holds him over his head, and heads for the door]  Help! Help! [Mr. Krabs throws him out the door] My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Can't you see we're closed?! [rushes back to the game table] Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Six! One, two... [scenery changes from day to night. SpongeBob and Patrick are tired; Patrick is even asleep on the table] I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
SpongeBob: [very tired] I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. [he yawns, slings Patrick over his shoulder, and carries him out] See you tomorrow. [walks inside his house after bringing Patrick home. Rattling noises heard] Huh? Who's there? [turns light on]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
SpongeBob: [pushes Mr. Krabs outside] Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs. [closes door but Mr. Krabs is inside the house once again]
Mr. Krabs: Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you gotta...! [opens door, and Mr. Krabs is now outside]
Mr. Krabs: Tread softly, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: I'll roll for you, boy.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: One, two, three...
SpongeBob: [yelling in frustration] MR. KRABS! I WANNA GO TO BED!!! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
Mr. Krabs: A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? Though it is treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad. [SpongeBob shuts the door. Morning arrives, and then the rooster crows everyone up.] Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
SpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
SpongeBob: [excited] Pirates?
Mr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick appears from the side of SpongeBob's house] Treasure? [dancing around] We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip. [throws them a bag of pirate stuff] Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches!
Mr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
SpongeBob: [Walks towards the plank using two peg legs] Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! [falls on plank]
Patrick: [Walks towards the plank with two separate eye patches covering his eyes] And I'm BlindBeard the Pirate! [falls on SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh! [fade to ship sailing across in midair] Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
SpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... no. Only the captain can lay eyes on the map!
SpongeBob: Okie dokie, then!
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, "okie dokie, then!" A pirate says, "arrgh!"
SpongeBob: Okie... oops. [laughs while a jellyfish flies by him] I mean... [standing up] ARRGH, Captain Krabs. [eyes widen and sees a rock nearby] Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... ARRGH, Cap', ARRGH, we're, ARRGH, about, ARRGH, to hit, ARRGH...
Mr. Krabs: Out with it man, ARRGH!
Patrick: I, ARRGH, think, ARRGH, he's trying, ARRGH, to say-- [crash] land.
Mr. Krabs: AAAARRGH!!! From now on, only the captain says 'arrgh'! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater, captain.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh. We're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. [later] This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has... [Mr. Krabs pulls a leaf off] Which way, cap'n?
Mr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?
Patrick: Uhh... [pulls out a compass and visualizes it] let's see, uhh... [points] that way, captain!
Mr. Krabs: [cuts to the crew after walking] 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the "X"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east!
Patrick: Ohhhh, east? I thought you said "weast".
Mr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass are you reading lad?
Patrick: This one, sir.
Mr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. [cuts to the crew walking again] 9,551... 9,552...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
Patrick: And hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his cutlass, or by the size of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty of his crew. And without a loyal crew... [one of SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] what am I captain of? Just a... bunch of sand! [cries]
Patrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.
SpongeBob: [sniffles and crying] Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. [both cry]
Mr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!
Mr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
SpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one! [laying on ground at night outside tent]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
Patrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks!
SpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours!
Patrick: ...I know, hehehehe. [SpongeBob moves away]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [entering the tent] Captain Krabs?
SpongeBob: He's not here.
Patrick: Look! The treasure map.
SpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
Patrick: [walks toward the map] Yeah...
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: Nothing.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map. [Patrick touches the map]
Patrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?
SpongeBob: No, guess there isn't. [Both poking map. Map opens] Oops, Patrick, it opened by itself! [Both laugh. Eyes enlarge and search the map]
SpongeBob and Patrick: THE MAP! THE MAP! GOTTA SEE IT, GOTTA LOOK AT IT! [Eyes freeze for a second and then pop back in their heads.]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Patrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?
SpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
Mr. Krabs: [appearing right behind them and angry] Do you think this is a problem?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream] Ahh! Mr. Krabs!!
Mr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?
Patrick: We're sorry!
Mr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
SpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
Patrick: I think that.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
[SpongeBob and Patrick both begged in mercy and then the “X” symbol appeared underneath them.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Look! It's the "X".
Mr. Krabs: [eyes go into "X" like symbol] "X" marks the spot!
SpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map!
Mr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? [Spongebob and Patrick both start digging.] Dig! Dig! [minutes later] Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!
SpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha! Hand it up to me, lads! Heave! [Brings treasure up] We finally found it! [opens up the treasure chest]
Female Chorus: The Dutchman's Treasure!
All: Wow!
SpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
Patrick: I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
SpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!
SpongeBob: What about loyalty?
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Mr. Krabs: All for one!
SpongeBob: And one for all!
Mr. Krabs: All for one!!
SpongeBob: And one for all!!
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman...
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman... [wakes up] WHO DARES WAKE THE FLYING DUTCHMAN?! Keep it down, will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep. [noticing them fighting over treasure chest] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob and Patrick: And one for all. [Lightning]
Flying Dutchman: Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure???
Mr. Krabs: [shoves chest toward SpongeBob and Patrick] They did!
Flying Dutchman: Arrgh! [picks up the treasure chest] So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hugging each other in fear] Uh-huh!
Flying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.
[The Flying Dutchman giving them couple of gold doubloons]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Female Chorus: Two gold doubloons!
[SpongeBob and Patrick take the doubloons and the Flying Dutchman puts away his treasure chest in his pocket.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?
Flying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble. [Flicks something to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold! [a tiny plastic treasure chest] Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest!
Female Chorus: Plastic!
Flying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest! [laughs and disappears out of sight]
Patrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.
[Flying Dutchman turns into green smoke and vanishes.]


Squidward: Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image. [wife's head turns into Squidward's and the husband notices] I'll go down in history. Someday, there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!
Janitor: Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.
Squidward: Uncultured trash urchin. 9 A.M. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer! [opens door] Welcome to art class!!
Nat: Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry... [everyone leaves except SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?
Squidward: SpongeBob!? In art class? WAIT! THIS IS COOKING! COME BACK! You gotta be kidding!
SpongeBob: [laughs] This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?
Squidward: You're looking at him.
SpongeBob: You... are the teacher? To my pupil?! This isn't art class, it's Heaven.
Squidward: Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.
Squidward: So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, please.
Squidward: Well, art is not all fun and games. [as he picks up a big stack of books] It's a lot of hard... [he drops the stack, which makes SpongeBob's desk hop in the air] ...work. Okay. First, repeat after me: "I have no talent."
SpongeBob: I have no talent.
Squidward: "Mr. Tentacles has all the talent."
SpongeBob: Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
Squidward: "If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacle's talent may rub off on me."
SpongeBob: If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art. [smiles. The scene cuts to Squidward with a sad look on his face, the camera cuts back to SpongeBob and he is still smiling, the camera again cuts back to Squidward]
Squidward: Whatever. Okay. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say [draws a crooked circle] circle one. [laughs] Am I going too fast for you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: How's this, Squidward?
Squidward: What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.
SpongeBob: Well, first I draw this head. [draws an amazing head] Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.
Squidward: Gimme that. [crumples paper] Forget the circles.
SpongeBob: Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try. [laughs] Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog! That's you on the bottom.
Squidward: Gimme that. [rips up paper] There is nothing artistic about leapfrog! [SpongeBob puts pieces together] What are you doing, now?
SpongeBob: I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped up paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time... [blows paper]
Squidward: Do you want to learn art, or not?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.
Squidward: Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. Then, gently... [hits marble with chisel; and it breaks into a pile of rubble]
SpongeBob: [hits marble with chisel and it becomes a perfect sculpture of Michelangelo's David] How's this Squidward?
Squidward: [starry-eyed] It's beautiful. [a tear falls from his eyes] I mean... this isn't a sculpture. [SpongeBob's lip starts quivering] A good sculpture takes... more time! You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules. [SpongeBob wipes away a tear] Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong. [Squidward puts a nose like his on the sculpture] There, now it's art.
SpongeBob: Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons. [falls down and starts crying] I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence. [crawls over to the front door and looks back at Squidward] I don't even deserve to use your doors! [the doors open, hitting SpongeBob out the window into the garbage dumpster head-first]
Monty: Hello, there!
SpongeBob: But I did deserve that. [the dumpster closes on top of him] I deserved that, too. [garbage man takes SpongeBob to dump] And I deserve this!
Monty: Good day, sir!
Squidward: Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.
Monty: Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags.
Squidward: The world famous art collector?
Monty: The one and only.
Squidward: Well, what are you doing here?
Monty: I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.
Squidward: Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: "Squidward en repose".
Monty: I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection.
Squidward: Why not?
Monty: Because. It's an art collection! [laughs]
Squidward: How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.
Monty: More like: Belongs in the Trash! [laughs]
Janitor: Sorry. I must've missed that one. [grabs the painting and throws it in the trash]
Monty: Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?!
Squidward: Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...
Monty: Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship! This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw. [removes the nose Squidward added on and it lands on Squidward's head] Ahh, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame...
Squidward: Fame! [Squidward imagines himself as popular]
Monty: ...fortune...
Squidward: Fortune! [Squidward imagines himself in a tub full of money]
Monty: ...anything his heart desires!
Squidward: Anything?!?! [Squidward imagines himself with hair] It's me! It's me! I'm responsible!
Monty: I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal! Now, uh, help me get this in the car.
Squidward: I could use a little help. [sculptures head falls off and turns into dust] My fame! My fortune! My hair!
Monty: Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one.
Squidward: Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.
Monty: Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks. [laughs]
Squidward: Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. [closes the door as Monty walks out] I gotta find SpongeBob! [at dump] SpongeBob...SpongeBob?! SpongeBob!?
SpongeBob: Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.
Squidward: Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.
SpongeBob: Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame. [he slides out of the cereal box] These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy! I can't look at them. [SpongeBob's hands pop off and run into a soup can]
Squidward: Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really!
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really!
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really.
SpongeBob: Wow... [pause] Really?
Squidward: Let's go.
SpongeBob: [notices a painting in the dump] Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!
Squidward: Gimme that. [back at classroom] Okay, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before.
SpongeBob: I... can't!
Squidward: Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again!
SpongeBob: I did it, Squidward. [draws a crooked circle]
Squidward: Huh!? But-but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the...?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book.
Squidward: Uhh... [crumples paper] How about this, huh? Remember?
SpongeBob: That's not in the book, either.
Squidward: FORGET ABOUT THE BOOK!!! [grips the book and rips it] Ha! Look at all this mess, SpongeBob! [he grabs a chair, puts it in front of SpongeBob's desk, and jumps up and down while holding it] What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do!?
SpongeBob: Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it! [puts book back together] There we go! Yeah!! Ta-da! [Squidward's nose melts off his face]
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.
SpongeBob: First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.
Squidward: Now you've got it.
SpongeBob: I've gotta embrace the marble!
Squidward: Right.
SpongeBob: I've gotta sniff the marble!
Squidward: Well, uh, okay.
SpongeBob: I've gotta lick the marble!
Squidward: Uhh...
SpongeBob: [washes the marble in a washing machine] I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble! [expands himself so that he's the same size as the marble] I'VE GOTTA BE THE MARBLE! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
Squidward: Here you go, buddy. [hands him sculpting tools]
SpongeBob: With this tool, I shall give birth... to art!
Squidward: Oh, boy... [SpongeBob taps marble with the chisel; it shatters into a pile of rubble]
SpongeBob: But, one more thing. [puts a stone nose shaped like Squidward's on it] There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in. [Squidward shrieks with frustration and goes crazy, runs through the marble and kicks two marbles, eating a part of the marble, he takes paint, squeezes it, kicks a picture, destroys the marble into 4 pieces and destroys the other marbles] It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump. [runs through the wall and down the road singing in the tune of the William Tell Overture] ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump.♪
Monty: I'm here for the... what the? Who is responsible for this?!
Squidward: As of now, it's his responsibility. [puts hat on janitor's head] Good day to you, sir! [this is a reference to "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory", where Mr. Wonka tells Charlie and Grandpa Joe that they lost the contest by saying: "You get NOTHING!!! You lose! GOOD DAY, SIR!"]
[It is revealed that when Squidward smashed all of the marble together, he created an even better sculpture than the first one and left without even seeing it]
Monty: [to janitor] You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!


[Mr. Doodles is sniffing some coral.]
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, Mr. Doodles, [pulls Mr. Doodles away, choking him briefly] we haven't got all day. We've got to get down to me favorite restaurant. Mine. Where we're shooting our first ever Krusty Krab commercial. After this commercial airs, we'll be swarming with customers. I can already feel myself sweatin' money.
[Mr. Doodles barks.]
Mr. Krabs: No, I got Squidward organizing the whole thing. He's... ya know... artsy. [sees something he does not like] What the...? This looks expensive. Out of my way. Coming through. Move it or lose it. Squidward!
Squidward: [descending] What?
Mr. Krabs: What in Neptune's name is going on?
Squidward: We're making the commercial, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What you're doing is throwing away me money! I told you to rent, only, what is absolutely necessary.
Squidward: This is all necessary.
Mr. Krabs: Well what's all this useless junk? [the junk is shown]
Squidward: That's the useless junk for scene, uhh, 28!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, well, then how do you explain that: [pointing to 2 Krusty Krabs] a second Krusty Krab??
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, everyone needs an understudy! [showing Mr. Krabs' double]
Mr. Krabs: Well, ya got me there... but why do we need him? [pointing to a clown]
Squidward: This job gets very stressful, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: All right, get lost, all of ya. [everyone leaves angrily] You're fired. Go on. Scram. Get out of here, you moochers. That's right, keep moving. [stops the clown from leaving] Except you. You stay. [Clown smiles and a horn honks]
Squidward: Well, this is just great. Now we've got no crew to make the commercial.
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about, Squidward? We got the cheapest crew in the world. You, me, and SpongeBob. Speaking of which, where is the little barnacle?
SpongeBob: [sticks his nose from underground] I'm down here, sir.
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, lad?
SpongeBob: Squidward said I could help by burying myself.
Mr. Krabs: Quit fooling and come on out. [pulls SpongeBob out] I need you to be in the commercial.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Me? In the Krusty Krab commercial? Me! [we see a background of him smiling]
Squidward: But, but, but, but, but, but, but...
Mr. Krabs: [SpongeBob is still smiling] Don't throw your buts at me, Mr. Squidward. We got a timetable to keep. This thing airs tonight.
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Tonight?!
Mr. Krabs: Yup, I got a sweet deal on the prime-time slot.
Narrator: 3:28 am
SpongeBob: It's almost on, Gary.
Gary: [yawns]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I got butterflies, too. This is the most exciting thing to happen in the history of history. [TV shows wild west show. Then shows KK commercial]
SpongeBob: Look, Gary! It's on!
[commercial starts]
Pearl: Oh, Jen. I've got a real problem.
Squidward: [Jen] What's your problem, Amy?
Pearl: [Amy] I've got all this money and I don't know what to do with it and I'm hungry.
[Mr. Krabs is laughing off-set]
Pearl: [Amy] Who's there?
Squidward: [Jen] Where's that coming from?
[Purple smoke appears]
Amy and Jen: Yippee, it's Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: That's right, Amy. I heard all about your little problem and I'm here to help. Follow... me!
Amy and Jen: Where are we?
Mr. Krabs: Why, we're at none other than the Krusty Krab.
Amy: Did you say Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: That's right, Krusty Krab. Home of the world famous Krabby Patty!
Jen: What's a Krabby Patty?
[Mr. Krabs' jaw drops]
Mr. Krabs: Why, it's only the most mouthwatering appetizing food in the seven seas.
SpongeBob: THERE I AM, GARY, THERE I AM!
Mr. Krabs: We start with a fresh patty, grilled and juicy. Add some crisp undersea veggies and cheese. Topped off with secret sauce and some buns. Voila! A Krabby Patty.
Amy: I want a Krabby Patty.
Jen: Me, too.
Mr. Krabs: How do you like them Krabby Patties, girls? [laughs]
Amy &amp; Jen: [thumbs up. Mr. Krabs still laughing]
SpongeBob: LOOK, GARY, THERE I AM AGAIN, LOOK!
Mr. Krabs: Two more satisfied customers. So why don't you come on in, and have yourself a Krabby Patty today.
All: ♪The Krusty Krab: Come Spend Your Money Here!♪
[commercial ends]
SpongeBob: That was the best 60 seconds of my life! Well, time for bed. [The next morning, the rooster crows. SpongeBob wakes up and the alarm goes off] Time to go do my favorite thing at my favorite place. [humming]
Old Man Jenkins: Hey, you!
SpongeBob: Top of the morning, oldster.
Old Man Jenkins: Hey! I saw you on TV last night. [Then a flashback shows that Old Man Jenkins was actually watching a bran flakes commercial and saw the yellow box]
Announcer: New, Bran Flakes. Bold, new taste. Bran Flakes.
SpongeBob: You did?
Old Man Jenkins: Yeah. You were on a commercial.
SpongeBob: You're right! Wow, he recognized me.
Old Man Jenkins: Yup. See ya later, Bran Flakes. What a nice cereal box.
SpongeBob: [talking to self] "Weren't you that guy on TV?" Yes! I am that guy. [laughs] How kind of you to notice. Weren't you that guy on the television last night? Yes, that was me. I... [runs into Peterson]
SpongeBob: Oh, please excuse me, sir.
Peterson: Oh, that's quite all right, uhh, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Wow. I'm getting recognized all over. Why, next thing you'll know, people are going to start doing things like holding doors open for... [gasps] Why, sir, I'm flattered.
Peterson: Really? I don't smell anything.
SpongeBob: [laughs] You're on your way.
Fred: Excuse me, sir, can I get a napkin?
SpongeBob: Why, of course, good sir. And next time, feel free to approach me. It most be so degrading to ask across the room. And who am I making this bad boy out to?
Fred: To my tail fin. I'll get it myself.
SpongeBob: F-I-N. There we are, darling. Hmph. Looks like shyness got the best of him.
Squidward: There you are, SpongeBob. I need you to...
SpongeBob: No problem, Squidward. I got one already made out. Enjoy.
Squidward: [holding a napkin reading, "To my tailfin; Love, SpongeBob] To my tailfin? [checks to see if he has one]
SpongeBob: Yes, I am that guy on TV.
Tyler: Hey, look!
SpongeBob: Please, good people, no photos at work.
Tyler: Here's the ketchup.
SpongeBob: Well, maybe just one. [poses] Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it.
Mr. Krabs: There you are, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes, pilot.
Mr. Krabs: I need you to... [gets hit with mop] ...Ow! [finger breaks] Alright, boy. Get in there and scrub the head and stop acting so predictable.
SpongeBob: I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful. [we cut to Dale and Lou in the restroom]
Dale: Hey, were you able to catch Glenn the Pinkfish on Flounderman last night?
Lou: No. How was he?
Dale: Well, I knew that this guy's acting was good, but his singing was phenomenal. I'm telling you, Vendor, if that guy was to cut a solo record, he'd be a hit. [both close bathroom doors]
SpongeBob: [pupils change into stars] Solo record!
[In Mr. Krabs' office]
Mr. Krabs: So, if I fire him and make his successor do twice the work, and... [knock on door] ...eh, come in. [in walks SpongeBob and poses like a model] Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. Those heads better be beautiful.
SpongeBob: They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby.
Mr. Krabs: The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy.
SpongeBob: Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now.
Mr. Krabs: What in blazes are you talking about?
SpongeBob: Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person! We're on the same page here, aren't we?
Mr. Krabs: Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work.
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers twice] I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm outta here. [SpongeBob snaps his fingers outside his office]
Mr. Krabs: Oooooh, I've never felt such a strange combination of pity and indigestion.
Bill: There he is! Hey! We've been waiting for you.
Nazz: Where have you been? [SpongeBob makes an O-shaped mouth wiggling]
Bill: How long are you going to keep us standing here?
Squidward: Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders?
SpongeBob: Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast.
Squidward: I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us. [smiling] On second thought, keep 'em waiting.
SpongeBob: No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment.
Squidward: Enter-what?
[SpongeBob grabs microphone]
SpongeBob: How you doing, folks?
All: HUNGRY!
SpongeBob: That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy! [turns down light's dimness]
Squidward: Hey!
Bill: [to his friend] Eating here was your idea!
SpongeBob: I'd like to call this little number "Striped Sweater." ♪The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind [screeching] 'Cause when you're wearing...♪[light turns back on; all yelling]
Bill: WE'RE STARVING!
SpongeBob: ♪That one... special... sweater...♪ [yelling continues] Squidward, this crowd is insatiable.
Squidward: Then why don't you back in the kitchen, and grab some patties, and give them what they [screams] CAME HERE FOR?!?!?!
SpongeBob: Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy. [crowd booing]
Nancy: Is this some kind of joke?
SpongeBob: They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd. [SpongeBob is now juggling patties]
Bill: Oh, now what's he doing?
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down three miles from a blood bank? A cab!
Bill: We're losing our appetites!
SpongeBob: Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer.
All: WE WANT PATTIES!
SpongeBob: Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa! [SpongeBob slips and patties flip in the air]
All: BOO!
SpongeBob: Noooooooooo! [talking in his head] My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on, wasted. [patties land on the grill]
Bill: Hey! Finally!
Nancy: That's what we've been waiting for.
[dotted lines form from his eyes to point to patty]
SpongeBob: They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks. [SpongeBob puts a whole ton of patties on the grill]
All: Yay!
SpongeBob: You like that?
Bill: It's what we wanted all along.
SpongeBob: [thinking] It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns! [speaking] It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this? [Flips patties inside buns]
All: Yeah!
SpongeBob: I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy.
Customers: We want onions! Cheese! Yeah!
SpongeBob: Ready for the grand finale? [splatting]
All: Whoopee! Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling.
SpongeBob: I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this.


[We see a live traffic jam on a busy expressway. Patchy is in one of the cars in it. He is also wearing sunglasses.]
Patchy: Let's go! [honks his horn] Hey, kids. Rush hour traffic here in Encino is really bad. A little music should soothe me jangled nerves. At least my in-dash hi-fi still works. [Patchy puts a cassette tape in the radio, which breaks and the music stops. Patchy shows the broken cassette tape.] Oh! Me ultra-rare Frampton Comes Alive 8-track destroyed! [Tosses it into the car] And I'm gonna miss the new SpongeBob cartoon if this traffic doesn't move soon! [Patchy groans and moans. Patchy's cell phone rings. The ringtone is SpongeBob's piccolo from the theme song. Patchy answers the phone] Who's calling? Yes, Patchy here. Start squawking.
Potty: [squawks] Hey, Patchy, the new SpongeBob cartoon is about to start. Where are you, brawk?
Patchy: Stuck on the 101. Be a dear and record it for me, will you?
Potty: Oh, I threw out that old Betamax machine in the garbage. [squawks]
Patchy: You what?!
Patchy: You what?!
Patchy: You what?!
Potty: Oh, calm down, beardy.
Patchy: Potty, you know how important this cartoon is to me! [Someone honks his horn at Patchy] Do you mind? I'm trying to talk to my parrot! [to Potty] Sorry, Potty. Just some landlubber. [Potty hangs up] Potty? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Guah. Dropped again. [Patchy closes his phone] Curse this traffic! [the traffic starts moving again] Oooooh! [Patchy pulls up his anchor. Patchy drives into a desert-like area] Arrrrrrr, home at last. What the...? [his eyes pop out from behind his pair of sunglasses, breaking them] Encino... it's gone. No! [Patchy cries] You know, kids, this kinda reminds Patchy of an old story. Another story of a lost city. Why don't you check it out? Oh, Encino. [starts crying again, episode starts. SpongeBob and Patrick are blowing bubbles]
Patrick: A beautiful specimen, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, hurry! [Patrick takes a photo of the bubble and it pops] How's it look, buddy? Ready for the old scrapbook?
Patrick: More like the scrap-heap. [throws the photo into a big pile] They never come out right! Oh, well, let's try again.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this one's gonna be a masterpiece.
Patrick: I'm ready. [SpongeBob blows a bubble in his image]
SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick!
Patrick: [takes a photo of the bubble but when he does, it pops] Oh, I missed it again! This darn camera isn't fast enough. [stomps on the camera]
SpongeBob: Hold on a second, Patrick! It's not the poor camera's fault you can't get a photo.
Patrick: It's not?
SpongeBob: No, it is the very nature of the fragile bubble.
Patrick: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes, it is, my friend. Allow me to demonstrate. [blows a bubble in the shape of a microphone and starts singing] ♪The sun must set at the end of every day.♪ [the sun sets and pops] ♪And the curtain must fall at the end of every play.♪ [a curtain made of bubble soap drops down behind Patrick and pops. SpongeBob floats up on a bubble. He is surrounded by lots of other bubbles] ♪And every little bubble ever blown must someday pop.♪ [all of the bubbles pop. SpongeBob falls]
Patrick: ♪Like presents on Christmas Day, it doesn't seem to stay. Or a cheese soufflé, it doesn't last all day.♪
SpongeBob: ♪I will try again...♪
Backup Singers: ♪Try again...♪
SpongeBob: ♪...To blow a bubble...♪
Backup Singers: ♪To blow a bubble...♪
SpongeBob: ♪...That will last all day.♪
Backup Singers: ♪To blow a bubble that will last...♪
Patrick: ♪...All day.♪ [SpongeBob begins to blow a giant bubble. The bubble captures them both and floats away] Um, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick. This bubble's gonna break all records!
Patrick: I hope it doesn't break until we get a little closer to the ground.
SpongeBob: Huh? [gasps] What have I done!? [The two start crying for help as the bubble drifts into a cave] We're never gonna get out of here!
Patrick: No! [the bubble is popped by a jagged point of half a broken amulet] What happened?
SpongeBob: [pointing to broken amulet] That's what happened, Patrick.
Patrick: Whoa, what is it? It looks really old.
SpongeBob:  Antis, what do think that means, Patrick?
Patrick: Antis, Antis...SquarePantis! Probably belonged to your ancient ancestors. [Picks up the half of the amulet] SpongeBob SquarePantis, you must wear the ancient crest of your ancestors, for it is your birthright! [shoves it into SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: [Falling] My birthright?! Ow, ooh, ow, ooh, ow! Let's take this to the Bikini Bottom museum, they'll know what it is!
[cut to museum]
Mr. Krabs: [Whistles] Oo...uh...beautiful day for standing outside a museum doin' nothin'.
Security Guard: Whatever you say.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs pretends to be administration] Hello there. Welcome to the museum! That'll be three dollars.
Old Lady: But I thought it was free Tuesday.
Mr. Krabs: No, no, no. Today's Monday. Otherwise I wouldn't be wearing this "I hate Mondays" shirt.
Old Lady: Good point.
Mr. Krabs: Enjoy the artifacts! [Mutters under breath] Don't stand in one place too long, people might mistake you for one. [Hears SpongeBob laughing] SpongeBob! [hides, then re-emerges when SpongeBob and Patrick go into the museum] Hew, that was a close one. [Old lady points him out to a police officer then Mr. Krabs runs inside]
Squidward: Neptune's ascension. The only surviving painting from the great lost city of Atlantis. This is just what the doctor ordered, Squiddy. Spending your day studying the Atlantean masters. And best of all, no Sponge... [SpongeBob and Patrick run in excitedly, knocking Squidward over] Oh, would you two watch were you're [Gasps] What is that? What are you doing with the amulet of Atlantis?
SpongeBob: We were just...
Squidward: You're going to steal it!?
SpongeBob: No. Squidward, we'd never...
Squidward: This is a new low, even for YOU TWO. Lucky for you, I was here today. Stealing artifacts could land you in the stony loneso... [Sees the amulet's half was still there and is dumbfounded]...ooooome?! You boobs found the missing half of the Atlantean amulet?
SpongeBob: What's an Atlantean omelet?
Squidward: Amulet, not omelet! It's the key to untold riches!
[Mr. Krabs shoves SpongeBob and Patrick over violently and faces Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: Did somebody say untold riches!?
Squidward: Yes, Eugene. The streets are lined with gold, and the street lamps are made with diamonds.
Mr. Krabs: Diamond light bulbs! I wonder what they make the money out of.
Squidward: For reasons unknown, this great city disappeared one day, but no ruins were ever found. All the inventions that you take for granted, were given to us by the Atlanteans. Their advances in art, financial wealth and weaponry were eons ahead of their time!
SpongeBob: Why is this bubble painted on the mural?
Squidward: That's just the oldest living bubble.
SpongeBob: The oldest living bubble, alive! [shoves Patrick in front of it] Behold, Patrick-the oldest living bubble!
Patrick: This is the most beautiful bubble I've ever seen.
Squidward: That's just a painting, you quarter-wit! [to Krabs] Quarter-wit. Ha, it's less than half. The real bubble lives in Atlantis, some dumb old bubble pales in comparison to the arts...
Mr. Krabs: Money!
Sandy: [comes onto the screen from out of nowhere] And science, don't forget science. What's all the hubbub, boys?
Squidward: These two chowderbrains found the missing half to the amulet of Atlantis.
Sandy: The Amulet of Atlantis?! Legend says, that when the two halves are joined, the path to Atlantis is opened! What are y'all waitin' for? Let's hitch them two dogies up! Go on, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs: Hurry up, Squidward, that money ain't gettin' any younger. [Squidward connects the two halves and a bright light activates. Squidward is happy. Sandy is in disbelief. SpongeBob and Patrick exclaim excitedly.]
Patrick: [screams]
SpongeBob: Hoo hoo, yeah, hoo hoo hoo!
[A van drops from the ceiling]
Squidward: The magical path to Atlantis is a van?
Mr. Krabs: Nice hot rod flames!
Patrick: [Coin spins and attaches itself to the bus] What's it doing? [The door to the van opens. We fade to black, then to the bus opening again. Sandy looks inside]
Sandy: Well, holly-wally ding-dang-doo. Would ya look at that!? Take a gander, y'all!
Squidward: Fabulous decor!
Mr. Krabs: Quite a vessel, but who's manning it?
Robot: Greetings. Welcome aboard the seaship Atlantis. This is a nonstop trip, so please take a seat, relax, and we'll be on our way.
Mr. Krabs: Bet there's some loose change in here!
SpongeBob: Ah, so this is what luxury feels like.
Squidward: Ah, what I wouldn't give for a foot-rub.
Robot: Attention, passengers, regretfully, we lack the fuel needed for forward motion.
All: What!?
[later, we see them all pushing the bus to the gas station. Mr. Krabs takes the hose and tries to fill up the bus with gas, but can't find the gas tank]
Mr. Krabs: Is this some kind of joke? Where's the gas tank?
Robot: We Atlanteans find the use of fossil fuels to be counter-intuitive, and have developed an alternative source we call song.
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Robot: The engine of this vessel is fueled by song. The more you sing of your desires, the closer to Atlantis you will get. Let us commence singing.
Squidward: Does that make any sense?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm game for singing any day! ♪Sing? Sing a song? A song of wanting to move along!♪ [The van rises up and floats in mid-air. SpongeBob sings off-key] ♪To a land where all our dre-e.♪ [The van crashes back down]  Whoops, sorry. ♪To a land where all our dreeeeeams, can finally come true.♪ [The van rises up high. It makes a hole in the roof] ♪A bubble I long for, that so eludes me, but soon enough I will seeeeeeeeeeeeeee...♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪Well that's just splendid boy! A land where it rains money! More than you can spend. With fives and tens and fifties and I'll want to be your friend.♪
Plankton: ♪Ha, ha ha. Such a valiant desire - hehehe. The lost weapons of Atlantis - the most advanced of all time. As soon as this dopey song is done, I plan to make them miiiiine!♪
Sandy: ♪Did you all hear something? I can hardly believe that there's a lost city where having smarts is more important-than being pretty!♪ [Sandy makes a clone of herself, and divides herself] ♪With all their advanced science, and my painfully large mind!♪
Sandy Clone: ♪I bet we can figure out how to make wondrous things, like melons with edible rinds!♪ [they dig in on watermelon. Juice gets on the screen and transitions to Squidward playing piano]
Squidward: ♪As a connoisseur of fine art, I'm proud to say! I've always seen things in my own special way! 'Art'-lantis, with their glorious aesthetics, I'll copy their style in a while- my art will be prophetic!♪
Patrick: ♪I'm Patrick, I'm Patrick, Patrick-Patrick-Patrick! And I like um, uuuuh,♪ [record scratches] I don't know what I like.
Robot: Warning, you have run out of song fuel. 
All: [Everyone huddles together and screams until Squidward looks out the window]
Squidward: Hey, look, it's Atlantis.
SpongeBob: Pretty!
All: [They continue to scream and the bus smashes through a city wall of Atlantis. We see that it has futuristic blue and purple buildings with spires and bubbles. The bus suddenly skids to a stop, unearthing some trees in the process. The five emerge from the bus.]
Squidward: You dimwits haven't even been here two minutes and you've already messed up someone's topiary garden.
Mr. Krabs: Go on, SpongeBob. Ring the bell.
SpongeBob: Ring for the king, huh? [rings the bell. A red carpet comes down the stairs and Lord Royal Highness comes out]
Lord Royal Highness: Welcome to Atlantis. I've been expecting you. [Falls down the stairs] Allow me to introduce myself. I am the Lord Royal Highness, but my friends call me LRH.
SpongeBob: My friends call me SpongeBob. I'm here to see the oldest living bubble.
LRH: Yes, of course.
Mr. Krabs: What a ripoff! This street ain't gold!
LRH: Oh, if it's gold you want, you'll find it in our vault.
Mr. Krabs: I'm Eugene. I like money.
LRH: Yes, I can see that. Pleasure to meet you. Come, I'll give you the grand tour of our Atlantean fortress. I'm so glad you're all here.
Plankton: They're gone. Now to get to those weapons... [tries to open the glovebox door, but fails] Trapped! Okay, what do I have to work with here? What's this? Owners manual!? Looks like I found my escape route! [Laughs diabolically] Ow!
LRH: For centuries, we Atlanteans spent, nay, wasted our talents and energy building the most sophisticated weaponry to defend ourselves from invaders. But we abandoned the idea of warfare long ago and now all these weapons gather dust behind this locked door as an example of what must be done if one wishes to live in harmony with all creatures of this, or any, world.
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!
LRH: But of course, follow me.
Mr. Krabs: Comin' through, boys!
Plankton: These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded? No wonder they got lost. [Squeezes under door] Oh, my! There will be no one to stop me this time! [Laughs diabolically. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Well, bad news, kids. Encino's still lost. [The radio starts playing] Oh! But, at least I got me radio fixed! [Patchy snaps his fingers while listening to it, then it explodes] Well, enjoy the rest of the show. [cuts back to Atlantis and then cuts to LRH giving the tour]
LRH: It is both an honor and a pleasure to welcome you to Atlantis. We haven't had visitors in some time. You see, being in a lost city has certain disadvantages which I digress. Now if you follow me, I'll show you some of our grandest achievements...
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! You told me the streets were paved with gold. Now that street light better be a 600 karat diamond or else. [Mr. Krabs gets on Squidward's neck and starts unscrewing a lightbulb] Ah hold still, Squidward.
Squidward: You're standing on my neck!
[They trip and the light bulb smashes]
LRH: Are you all right?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, but I feel odd.
[Mr. Krabs starts acting strange]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
[Mr. Krabs sniffs]
Mr. Krabs: I'd know that smell anywhere. [Pockets have mouths and start barking like dogs] Me pockets! They be smelling loot! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[His pockets drag him into the hall of Treasure and start taking the treasure]
LRH: Those pockets of yours certainly have a nose for treasure.
Mr. Krabs: These are me houndstooth pants.
LRH: What you see here is a glimpse of ancient Atlantean history. Long ago we abandoned our obsession with wealth to focus on the pursuit of knowledge. So help yourselves to as much as you pockets can carry!
Mr. Krabs: As much as me pockets can carry?! ♪Oh, if I'd only known when I woke up today, I'd have stopped at me tailors along the way, and had ten more pockets put on me pants, 'cause I think I hear a money avalanche!♪ [yodels] ♪Look at all this cash, hey, look at all this money! I hope me heart can take it!♪ [goes unconscious]
Fish: Clear! [shocks Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: ♪I'm alright, sonny! Industrial accidents can make quite a mess. Unless you fall into a money press. Oh, make me into money, Mr. wonderful machine, I always knew that me true color was green! Oh, ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of such a place, yes I did! With mountains of money, and rivers of cash. And a pool of coins to make a splash! Oh, I'll open up a Krusty Krab with patties made of money. They'd be delicious, and expensive, and taste like golden honey! Money and gold and treasure untold! And all of it for me!♪
LRH: Mr. Krabs, we're off to see the bubble, would you care to join us?
Mr. Krabs: Are you kidding?! I've just got here!
LRH: Very well then. Off we go.
Patrick: SpongeBob, when are we gonna see the bubble?
SpongeBob: Patrick, shhh!
LRH: Don't dally, lads. You don't wanna be left behind do you?
SpongeBob: No, sir.
Sandy: You know, LRH, I was born with a scientific curiosity and I was wonderin' if I could have a look at some of your scientific achievements?
LRH: Of course, Miss Cheeks, here we are, the combination of all our technology. I give you the Atlantean Hall of Science.
[Opens a large door]
Sandy: Hoppin' acorns. Look at all this high tech gear! [Looks at an invention] What does this gizmo do?
LRH: It's a biomass converting device. It can take any household object--this comb, for example--and turn it into say, ice cream. Would anyone like to try?
Both: Oh me, me, me, me, meee, mee!
LRH: Go ahead!
Both: Yay!
[The boys eat the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Comb flavored.
Sandy: What else can it turn things into?
LRH: Actually it can only turn things into ice cream. We haven't worked out that bug yet but I can show you the most amazing/fantastic device created by Atlantean hands. Behold, this grand machine allows the user to shrink down to nano-stature, enabling them to battle germs hand to hand.
Sandy: How's it work?
LRH: Please have a seat and I'll show you. Now...
SpongeBob: Hey, cool.
[SpongeBob disappears]
Patrick: Where'd SpongeBob go?
LRH: Right now, his molecules are being broken down into data which is assembled in this computer and is stored on these tapes, then re-assembled on a much smaller scale...
SpongeBob: Someone help me!
LRH: And finally passes through this tube into this tank which contains every living element known to... [peers closer] Oh, dear heavens! It looks like our scientists were working on a very aggressive case of the sniffles! He could be in trouble.
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'm coming to help you!
[Patrick disappears]
Squidward: Okay, I've seen enough. Let me out of this thing! [Squidward disappears and reappears into an 8-bit scene] What's going on here? I... Oh no. [screams]
[Squidward sees a giant nose]
SpongeBob: Squidward, don't make any sudden movements!
[The nose sneezes germs and Squidward falls over, jumps quickly and runs]
Squidward: Help! [Screams]
[SpongeBob and Patrick follow while they're being chased by germs, and Sandy enters the game]
All: Help, Sandy!
Sandy: Sounds like them critters is in trouble! [The nose catches SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward, and the germs block Sandy from getting to them] Hold on, fellas! I'll be there soon, as soon as I send these critters to their doom! [A title screen shows like a Nintendo game] ♪Look out, germs. The end is here, Your days are numbered, 'cause Sandy's here! I'll get these germs, and make 'em pay, with some good old fashioned ka-rah-tay.♪ Hi-yah! ♪If I borrow some elements from the periodic table I can mix up a brew that is sure to disable any virus, bug, or sniffle that steps into my path. And make them feel my mi-cro-sco-pic wrath!♪ Hi-yah! [she hits the nose with a submarine and defeats it, the rest of the gang gets saved, they all cheer, then the game says: "Game Over". Everyone is out of the machine]
LRH: Well, shall we continue on with the rest of the tour?
Sandy: Y'all head out without me.
[Sandy goes back in the machine again]
LRH: Well then, good luck. Have fun. We'll see you at dinner. [To SpongeBob] Your friend Sandy certainly is an excitable one.
SpongeBob: Quite.
Squidward: Somehow I knew I'd get stuck with you yahoo's the longest.
[The camera zooms in to the heater vent where Plankton is hiding, Plankton chuckles]
Plankton: ♪Oh, what a beautiful sight! Weapons as far as the eye can see. But which one will be right for me? How do I pick? Which one will do the trick? Which is best to guarantee eternal rest? So many weapons! How do I choose? Look at this one with a beautiful fuse! And with this one I couldn't lose. That one will surely give them the blues... And this one here matches my shoes!♪ [serious tone] Come on, Plankton, just pick one and forget about your shoes! Eeny, meeny, minie moe, I pick you, now let's go! [jumps into a giant tank's gun. Scene cuts to LRH giving the tour]
Squidward: This stuff is wonderful and all but when are we going to see some real Atlantean culture?
LRH: Gentlemen? What is art?
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, I know, I know!
[Squidward shoves SpongeBob]
Squidward: I thought you'd never ask! Art is the conscious arrangement of elements in a manner that affects a sense of beauty.
LRH: Not even close! [Squidward looks shocked] Art is what happens when you learn to dream. [Gives SpongeBob a blue paint brush] Go ahead. Dream a little.
[SpongeBob touches the wall with the brush and the paint creates SpongeBob's house door]
SpongeBob: It looks like my front door!
LRH: Behold! The Hall of Arts!
[He opens the door, they step in, and Squidward's mouth opens]
Squidward: Incredible! [cries] The creativity! The artistry! [Walks in front of a painting] This painting is so realistic! It looks like you could step straight into it.
LRH: And you can!
[Throws Squidward into the painting]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Squidward: This place is amazing! [steps into other paintings] ♪Isn't this great, isn't this neat, I'm a living work of art from my head to my feet! From the very first drawings on walls in caves, art has been what the heart and soul craves! So pick up a brush, a pencil or pen. If you don't like this one, paint it again! From now on please call me Sir Real. I can wait for your impression to congeal. Take it from an undersea renaissance man. I'd even look great on the side of your van! Any way you carve it, I am art and art is me. Ask your mama or your dada to tell you about the uh, schism. Between minimalism and cubism. My personality may be of the cynical type. But I've finally found something that lives up to the hype. I can say honestly and with great certainty, that Atlantis is where I want to spend eternity!♪ [holds note. Scene cuts when Squidward's out of the painting]
Atlantean: Hey, can you not sing? I'm trying to model here.
Atlantean Painter: Now hold on Nando. Why don't you take five. I'm really diggin' this squid's form.
[The other Atlantean sighs and walks away]
Squidward: Looks like I'll be here inspiring these Atlantean art makers with my beauty. You guys go on ahead!
SpongeBob: Okay. Bye, Squidward!
[They leave and Squidward poses]
LRH: Now this section of town is known for its advances in the science of fondue cooking.
SpongeBob: Excuse me, sir, this tour has been great and all, but uh, can we see the bubble now?
LRH: Do excuse me. Most folks don't stay with the tour this long. Of course you can. First, remember this. This bubble is over one million years old. It was brought here when the first Atlanteans colonized this place. Deftly hand carried over billions of light years from our home planet. It is our people's most beloved and treasured ancient relic. But most importantly remember to have fun!
[Points to where the bubble is, and they walk to the bubble]
SpongeBob: There it is Patrick!
Both: The World's Oldest Living Bubble!
[They land on the safe keeping tube]
SpongeBob: Look at it, Patrick! So ancient, so floaty. It is the most beautiful, wrinkled up, dusty old bubble I've ever seen!
Patrick: Like a delicate air raisin!
[They slide off the glass]
LRH: Now if you'll excuse me, I have to make ready for tonight's dinner. So I'm just going to leave you two friendly strangers alone with our most beloved ancient and fragile Atlantean relic. Join us in the dining hall when you've had an eye-full!
[LRH leaves]
SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Lord Royal Highness, sir. [They shove their faces on the glass] Just look at it, Patrick. Ah the stories this bubble could tell. I just wish we could get a closer look. [They lean in but the glass moves] Patrick! Get the--
Patrick: Oh, golly! Oh, I don't know how much longer I can hold this!
[They managed to get the glass back after a close call when the bubble land on the glass on SpongeBob's side and bounces off without any harm, they laugh in victory]
SpongeBob: Whoo, that was a close one buddy!
Patrick: Yeah! We almost popped the most prized possession of all Atlantis-eans! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Boy, that would have been out greatest blunder without a doubt! But we should go before something bad does happen.
Patrick: Ooh! Let's get a picture for our scrapbooks before we leave.
SpongeBob: Great idea, Patrick!
Both: Cheese!
[Patrick's camera flashes, and the bubble pops]
SpongeBob: [teeth closed] Patrick, did you hear something?
Patrick: [teeth closed] A sort of a popping sound?
SpongeBob: Mmm-hmm.
[They look at each other screaming and their skin peels off, and SpongeBob's eyes fall in his mouth. Scene cuts to the gang having dinner]
LRH: So sorry I'm late. The tour ran a little long. So, how are you all enjoying our beloved city?
Squidward: I'm never leaving this place. I've learned more about painting in a few hours here than I did in four years of community college.
[Shows LRH a painting]
LRH: Absolutely marvelous! And Eugene, I assume the hall of treasure was everything you hoped for? [Mr. Krabs is brain-washed by the money and talks gibberish] And Sandra, how did you find our laboratory?
Sandy: They are just amazing! I used your invention room to make this!
LRH: Splendid. What does it do?
Sandy: I'll show you. [Presses a button, the food goes directly in her stomach and rubs it] Now I can eat underwater without removing my helmet! This is just the beginning! I should have a cure for the common cold up and running by tomorrow afternoon with your high-tech lab!
[SpongeBob and Patrick walks in feeling nervous]
LRH: SpongeBob, Patrick, tell me. How did you enjoy our rarest and most prized possession?
SpongeBob: [gulp] We have to go back to Bikini Bottom now!
All: Huh?
LRH: Ahahaha! Come. Enjoy the best Atlantean cuisine has to offer before you leave.
[SpongeBob and Patrick shakes]
Squidward: What is wrong with you two morons?
SpongeBob: We have to go home now!
Squidward: Why would you want to leave a paradise like Atlantis?
SpongeBob: Because, uh, Gary misses me?
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob's house where Gary is having a party with other snails]
Patrick: We destroyed your most prized possession! [Covers mouth]
LRH: [pauses] Ahahaha! If there's one thing we Atlanteans enjoy, it's a healthy dose of dark humor!
SpongeBob: It's not a joke, we burst the bubble!
[Sandy and Squidward gasped]
LRH: Haha. That's not the real bubble. It's just a prop for the tourists. This is the real deal.
[Holds up the real bubble in a bottle]
Both: Ooh!
[Patrick takes a picture of the bubble and the bubble finally pops]
LRH: [snarls] Summon the Atlantean Royal Guard! [The guards come and grunt, SpongeBob and Patrick shakes in fear for what they've done] Seize these hostile bubble poppers! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and Squidward and Mr. Krabs join them]
Sandy: Don't just stand there! Move!
[She pushes the gang, the guards attack with a trident, pickaxe, and mace]
Mr. Krabs: Can't you go any faster Sandy?
Sandy: Maybe, if y'all use your feet!
Mr. Krabs: Never mind! Just keep doing what you're doing!
[Sandy groans, the guards shoot clear balls at them, Sandy throws Patrick like a boomerang, Patrick hits the wall]
Sandy: Come on, Patrick!
[She grabs Patrick, the guards shoot and Sandy uses SpongeBob as a shield]
SpongeBob: [laughs] That tickles!
Sandy: Hang in there, little buddy! [she uses Squidward's tentacles to grab the shooting balls, and fires the balls at the guards by pulling Squidward's nose. Then, she uses Mr. Krabs and he uses his claws to knock the guards out of the way]
LRH: Don't let them get away!
[The guards follow the gang outside the building, but they all see Plankton's giant tank, Plankton aims at them while laughing diabolically. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: [realizes that there is no water left] This is the end of patchy. No water, no food, and still no Encino. And here come the vultures the pick me bones! [Potty flies up] Shiver me timbers! It's Potty! I wonder what parrot tastes like... Come back here! Uh-oh. Here come the hallucinations.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Patchy, it's me. SpongeBob SquarePants. [Patchy is excited, and then he cries] Don't lose hope. Everything will be all right when you get to Encino.
Patchy: But, Encino is gone.
SpongeBob: It's not gone, if you believe.
Patchy: Believe, believe. [falls asleep. Wakes up and reads the sign] Welcome to Encino! It's back! [hugs the sign] SpongeBob was right! All I had to do was believe. [laughs]
♪You got to believe. It was out of sight. You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to believe. Everything's all right. The sky above, and the ground below. Bring me back into Encino. It was lost, some time ago, I'm just glad to be back home. You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to believe. Everything's all right. You got to believe. I'm back in Eencino. You got to believe. Everything's all right.♪
Baby: Ohh! Ohh!
♪You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to believe. Everything's all right. You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You got to...♪
Patchy: [drops his ice-cream scoop and we hear strange sounds. Potty squawks, and then pokes Patchy] Ow! Ow! It was all a hallucination. Encino's still gone! [Patchy cries] Oooooo, a sandwich. Potty, you're a lifesaver. [opens a sandwich] Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Oh, Potty, you know I don't like mayo! [sees a vulture] Here, you want some? Go on. Take it. You know, I don't like the mayonnaise, you know. You know, when it gets above 130, 135, it gets kind of grody, you know.
[cuts to the gang standing in front of the tank]
Plankton: [laughs diabolically] Cower to me, fools! I have commandeered the most powerful weapon in the Atlantean arsenal! Now bow before the new king of Atlantis and prepare to taste my wrath! [He stomps on the switch, and the switch didn't budge] Yeah! Huh? Uh, uh I mean, uh, prepare to taste my wrath! [He stomps on the switch rapidly harder, but it still didn't budge] Oh, you! [Grabs a rock while struggling] Prepare to taste my wrath! [Throws the rock on the switch, and the switch budged]
Computer: Launch sequence deployed! [The tank shakes and Plankton laughs diabolically, everyone gasps and they hold onto each other. The tank shoots out ice cream and a cow's moo is heard, and SpongeBob and Patrick starts eating the ice cream]
Patrick: Plankton's wrath tastes like ice cream.
Both: Thanks, Plankton!
Plankton: Ice cream? It shoots ice cream?!? [Plankton jumps out of the tank] Oversized ice cream maker! [Kicks the tank] Yah! Ouch! Ow!
LRH: Look! A talking speck! This talking speck will make a fantastic [looks at SpongeBob and Patrick] replacement for our recently deflated national treasure! [Looks at Plankton] [Babyish tone] Won't you little fella?
Plankton: I'll destroy all of you--
[LRH squeezes him]
LRH: Amazing! This is so much better than that dusty old bubble!
[Plankton is in the baby bottle cage]
Plankton: You haven't seen the last of me! When I get out of here I'll hunt you all down like a pack of-- [someone takes a picture] Hey! Can't you read? [Points at sign] No flash photography!
[The gang is getting on the van]
LRH: So nice to meet you all. I hope you have a safe journey back home. And do come back any time.
SpongeBob: So long. And thanks for the tour.
[Everyone is in, and LRH closes the door, he takes the amulet off the van and gives it to a guard]
LRH: Dispose of this quickly. We can't survive anymore visitors like these.
Guard: [salutes] Sir, yes, sir!
[He runs to the dumpster and throws the amulet in there, LRH waves goodbye as they go off]
LRH: I thought sponges were supposed to make life easier.
[Scene cuts to the bus] [Everyone is feeling sad, except SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: ♪Goodbye, Atlantis. But we really have to go. Back to a little town, that is the greatest place I know-oh-oh-oh-oh! Back to Bikini Bottom! I can hardly wait!♪
Mr. Krabs: ♪But what about the treasure? It was really great!♪
SpongeBob: ♪I love Bikini Bottom! It's where my Gary is!♪
Sandy: ♪But Atlantis had that science stuff at which I was a whiz!♪
SpongeBob: ♪Soon I'll see the Krusty Krab. Where I'm happily employed!♪
Patrick: ♪But Atlantis had the oldest bubble which I cruelly destroyed!♪
SpongeBob: ♪You can't beat Bikini Bottom! No place is so nice!♪
Squidward: ♪But Atlantis was a fabulous, artistic paradise!♪
SpongeBob: ♪Sorry, Squidward. But it's the end of our Atlantean vacation!♪
Squidward: ♪And back to my depressing life of quiet desperation.♪
SpongeBob: ♪Goodbye, Atlantis. We're Bikini Bottom bound!♪
Squidward: ♪Please turn this bus around!♪
SpongeBob: ♪We had our fun!♪
Patrick: ♪We sure did!♪
SpongeBob: ♪But now we're done.♪
Sandy: ♪And I'm bummed.♪

SpongeBob: ♪So now we say goodbye!♪
Mr. Krabs: I think I'm gonna cry!
Patrick: Me too!
SpongeBob: ♪Goodbye, Atlantis. We're Bikini Bottom bound. There's no place like home!♪
Mr. Krabs: There's no place like Atlantis!
SpongeBob: ♪I can't wait to get home.♪
Mr. Krabs: I don't wanna go back!
SpongeBob: ♪We're Bikini Bottom bound!♪
Sandy: Please don't make us leave!
SpongeBob: ♪We're Bikini Bottom bound!♪
Squidward: Stop saying that!
SpongeBob: ♪I even love the sound!♪
All: ♪Goodbye Atlantis!♪
SpongeBob: ♪Bikini Bottom is the greatest place to be! I can--♪
All: ♪Goodbye Atlantis!♪ [Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Pretty good story, eh, kids? [Steps on something, which happens to be Encino] I found Encino. [Realized it's been shrunken] But, it's all tiny. Somebody must have... [Sees a big blue beam while screaming, and three aliens appear]
Norbluckfive's mother: Sorry, sir. Our son Norbluckfive was messing with his shrink-a-tron again.
Patchy: No, no, no, no! I want Encino full size again! There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
Norbluckfive's mother: Okay, hand it over, Norbluckfive. [Norbluckfive pulls out a remote and gives it to his mother] We'll fix your town, Beardy.
Patchy: Beardy? [Then, Norbluckfive's mother pushes the button, causing a huge tornado to be created with Patchy in it screaming. Cuts to Patchy's house] Well, Look's like everything's back to the right size, eh, Potty? [Wonders where Potty is] Potty?
Potty: Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! [Stomps on Patchy]
Patchy: Ow! Well, kids, I'm a little busy right now, but, be sure to come back real soon for more of your old pal Patchy. Ow! And more SpongeBob SquarePants. Potty, will you get off of me! [SpongeBob laughs]


[episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick walking through Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Jellyfishing. I can't wait! Can you, Patrick? [Patrick is eating tartar sauce] Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: Did you say something?
SpongeBob: Uh, I said... [he gets hit in the eye with a jellyfishing net] Ow!
Patrick: I'm not sure how to respond to that.
SpongeBob: [Gasps happily] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! [Mermaid Man is sleeping]
Barnacle Boy: [to Mermaid Man] Hey! We're stuck here, remember?
Mermaid Man: Why is that?
Barnacle Boy: Because you forgot to fill up the boat mobile before we left. See?
SpongeBob: Hey, heroes! Is there anything we can do? [bubble transition to where SpongeBob and Patrick are pushing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy while they grunt and get tired] That's a heavy piece of nothing... [pants] So, is that it?
Barnacle Boy: Yes. Uh, thank you, boys. We don't usually do this, but in term for pushing the invisiboat up all those hills, there's something I'd like you to see. But you must promise to not touch anything.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Okay! [Bubble transition to where Barnacle Boy opens the locker door] Wow!
SpongeBob: Oh, the magic claw from episode 1582! Man Ray's power glove!
Patrick: Ooh! A pair of binoculars.
Mermaid Man: Yes, boys, this is our locker of memories. It contains... Uh... I can't remember.
Barnacle Boy: [sighs] It contains all the memorabilia up from our super-human adventures.
Patrick: Wow. Hey, SpongeBob, check it out!
SpongeBob: The Dirty Bubble's bubble wand!
Barnacle Boy: Correct! [blows the bubble wand to reveal the Dirty Bubble, the Dirty Bubble starts laughing evilly.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [starts screaming nervously as the Dirty Bubble stares at them.]
Barnacle Boy: [laughs] Scared, boys?
SpongeBob and Patrick&#160;: Mmm-hmm.
Barnacle Boy: Well, don't be. [pops the Dirty Bubble with a needle]
Mermaid Man: And as long as no one touches anything, there's nothing here to be scared of.
SpongeBob&#160;: Understood.
Barnacle Boy: And this is our time machine. This device allows us to transport into the future or past at a date or destination of our choosing.
SpongeBob and Patrick&#160;: Ooh!
Barnacle Boy: Unfortunately, the consequences of altering the order of history are so dangerous, we've chosen it to leave it alone, so you mustn’t touch...
Patrick&#160;: [yells] Hey, this snack machine took my quarter! I want my crunchy munchities!
Barnacle Boy: No!
Patrick&#160;: Stupid box! [presses the start button on the time machine and the alarm goes off] You really gotta get that thing fixed.
Barnacle Boy: You fool! You realize what you've done?!
Patrick: [cluelessly] Well, I lost a quarter.
SpongeBob, Patrick, Mermaid Man, and Barnacle Boy: [the Episode goes to where they all scream all the way in the time machine]
SpongeBob: Oh, where are we? [gasps] It can't be! Bikini Bottom has at least 39 people living here!
Barnacle Boy: Maybe as you knew it, but this is a different Bikini Bottom of another time. Maybe if you've hadn't touched the time machine like we told you, Patrick, we wouldn't be in this mess! Hopefully, we hadn't changed anything with our presence.
[Barnacle Boy points his finger at Patrick angrily as the latter shrinks back in fear].
SpongeBob: Oh! Everything looks so old-fashioned.
Man Ray: [laughs wickedly, destroys Bikini Bottom, and laughs wickedly a reprise] I'm ready to rule the world and its riches! With this weapon, nothing can stop me!
Young Mermaid Man: That's what you think.
Man Ray: [gasps] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?!
Young Mermaid Man: Sorry, Man Ray. But my stalwart companion Barnacle Boy and I beg to differ with you.
Young Barnacle Boy: You've tangled with the wrong end of the fishhook of justice, Man Ray.
Young Mermaid Man: Now prepare for a heaping helping of quick drying tartar sauce.
Mermaid Man: Wow, our bodies were so tight.
Barnacle Boy: What went wrong?
Young Barnacle Boy: [Man Ray screams] Jumpin' jellyfish, Mermaid Man, what happened to the tartar sauce?
Patrick: [burps] Good thing that was around. I was starving.
Young Mermaid Man: Curious. Could I have forgotten to refill it?
Man Ray: [shoots up the Tartar Sauce can up while laughing]
Patrick: This is creeping me out!
SpongeBob 1: Patrick, what about Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Patrick: I don't got time for that! [runs away with SpongeBob]
Mermaid Man: Where are you going, boys?
Patrick: [SpongeBob and Patrick are in the locker] I just want to go home!
Barnacle Boy: When are we gonna have those two re-classified as villains? [The time machine disappears]
Mermaid Man: They left us here! What are we going to do? Eh, I'm sure it'll all work out.
Young Mermaid Man: Don't worry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are always here to help the elderly. There's something familiar about these two, Barnacle Boy. I just can't put my flipper on it.
Young Barnacle Boy: Hey, neat hat!
Barnacle Boy: Thanks, I... uh... [Man Ray laughs wickedly]
Young Mermaid Man: Let’s get these poor defenseless seniors out of harm's way.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [episode goes to where they scream on the way back]
Patrick: Well, that's more like it. Back in good old present day Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick, we're all born in our old place in time. Hello, fellow citizen. [This is a robot with a surveillance camera. Cut to show Squilliam Fancyson glueing poster with Man Ray saying "He has a plan" to a wall] Hello, Squilliam.
Squilliam: Man Ray is great.
SpongeBob: Yeah. [He and Patrick walk away] Must be taking care of his community service obligations.
Patrick:  That'll teach him to jaywalk. [They pass over another poster saying "I am watching you" which has Man Ray's moving eyes on it]
SpongeBob: Say, uh, Patrick, do you notice anything different about our fair city? [A line of prisoners walks by them]
Patrick: Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the clatter of prison chains.
SpongeBob: I said, is there something odd about Bikini Bottom since we got back?
Patrick: No. But yes! Just look at the giant medicine billboard! [A billboard with Man Ray is shown, saying "He has a ray, and he's not afraid to use it"] It's missing a bolt on the bottom right corner!
SpongeBob: Even worse than that, Patrick. The police got new uniforms!
Patrick: Oh, no! What did they do with those old ones?!
SpongeBob: And yikes! What happened to the Krusty Krab?! [Reads the sign] "The designated area where you are permitted by Man Ray, your ruler, to obtain sandwiches using Man Ray dollars"? Do you see the under-lying tragedy in all this?
Patrick: I’m all out of Man Ray dollars?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. It means we somehow changed the course of history when we went to the past. And now, in this reality, Man Ray is ruler. Oh, we got to do something.
Patrick: But what?
SpongeBob: What any self-respecting citizen of the free world would do in a time of crisis. See if I still have a job! [He and Patrick walk into the Krusty Krab that now has metal walls and Man Ray watching the customers eating via screen]
Man Ray: Hey, you’re not eating fast enough!
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Squidw... [Thought it was Squidward but realized it was Barnacle Boy]
Barnacle Boy: Yes?
SpongeBob: [stammers]Barnacle Boy? What are you doing here?
Barnacle Boy: Just getting stuck in a wasted life.
Mermaid Man: [Rings the bell] Order up!
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man! He's wearing a hairnet! [As Mermaid Man sighs, he and Patrick run into kitchen] What happened? Why are the two greatest heroes ever stuck in this greasy spoon, not combating the evils of Man Ray?
Mermaid Man: I lost the desire and the physique to fight long ago, kid. Flipping patties is so much easier on the joints when you're my age.
SpongeBob: What about the younger Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Surely, they refused to surrender without a fight.
Mermaid Man: You got spaghetti for brains, kid? We are the younger ones. The older ones... [is about to cry] Bless their souls... have been immortalized in this very restaurant. [Older MM and BB graves are shown]
SpongeBob: I am so sorry for your loss of... yourself.
Barnacle Boy: I hate to break up the memorial service, but we're out of tartar sauce out here.
Mermaid Man: Tartar sauce?! The topping that destroyed life as we knew it! If only my tartar sauce attack hadn't failed that day, we wouldn't be living in this wasteland! We're already out?
Patrick: Yep. Chewy bits... [burps]
Mermaid Man: I knew I recognize you from somewhere, you were there. And you ate that tartar sauce on that day! Do you realize what you’ve done?!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mermaid Man. We didn't mean to destroy your lives and everything you held dear. What do we say to try to make things right? With your help, of course.
Mermaid Man: I'm not teaming up with you to do jack diddly squat! Besides, Man Ray had me by the neck! Oh, e-evil!
SpongeBob: Does that mean the defeat was so traumatic that it has given Man Ray a stranglehold on your psyche?
Mermaid Man&#160;: Barnacles, no! It means he put this electro-collar on me that won't allow me to leave the restaurant!
SpongeBob: Oh. Let's get the nasty thing off of you. [clings on to Mermaid Man's neck to try and take it off]
Mermaid Man: Haven't you two idiots done enough damage?
SpongeBob: I can't get a good grip on it! I must need a better angle. Hold on. Sorry, sorry. Hey, Patrick, can you give me a hand here?
Mermaid Man: Keep away from me! [SpongeBob and Patrick grunting]
SpongeBob: [Mermaid Man gets a bump on his head] Ta-daaa! You're free! Can we coax you and Barnacle Boy out of retirement to save the your universe?
Mermaid Man: I suppose you’ve proven your medal, kid. But I'll have my eye on you two. Now let's pop that Dirty Bubble!
SpongeBob: Actually, we're fighting Man Ray.
Mermaid Man: Oh. Well, in that case, let the lighthouse of justice shine on Ray Man!
SpongeBob 1: Okay, I suppose that's close enough. Back to the past, gents, just stop you from eating the tartar sauce again for the first time. Hmm.
The First SpongeBob, Patrick, Mermaid Man, and Barnacle Boy: [episode goes to where all scream in the time machine]
Man Ray: [destroys Bikini Bottom and laughs twice] I am ready to rule the world and its riches!
Young Mermaid Man: Not so fast, Man Ray!
Young Barnacle Boy: We've got a little surprise for you.
Second Old Mermaid Man: [He and along with the Second SpongeBob, Patrick, and Barnacle Boy come out of the locker machine] Keep your tongue out of the tartar sauce!
Mermaid Man: Impostors!
Second Old Mermaid Man: Who are you calling impostor, impostor? I must prevent our tartar sauce from being eaten by that fool!
Mermaid Man: If I want to get near my tartar sauce I gotta to go through me first!
Second Old Mermaid Man: I'm gonna make me eat those words!
Mermaid Man: Bring it. [The second beats the first] Take this! [beats the second] I’ll never let you win.
Second Old Mermaid Man: Oh, yes, I will.
Young Mermaid Man: What do you make of this, Barnacle Boy?
Young Barnacle Boy: Tangled timeline, Mermaid Man. I-
Man Ray: [laughs wickedly] You old coots provided me the perfect distraction. Now prepare to be disappeared!
Young Mermaid Man: Sounds good on paper, you purveyor of pure evil, but, fortunately, we all know what happens to paper underwater. Barnacle Boy, the tartar sauce. [pours tartar sauce on the Second Man Ray]
Patrick 2: Wow! I've never eaten that much tartar sauce.
Patrick 1: Yes, you have.
Patrick 2: Well, it sure ain't sittin' right.
Man Ray: [laughs wickedly] Foolish mools. Once again, your bufoonery has given me victory! [blows up the tartar sauce can and laughs wickedly] Oh, I'm going to savor this. It's not every day I get to defeat Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy three times over! [is about to shoot two SpongeBobs, Patrick, two Old Mermaid Mans and Barnacle Boys but another locker comes]
SpongeBob 2: [He along with the second Patrick comes out of the machine] Patrick, don’t eat the tartar sauce!
Man Ray: You’re too late! Your fat friend beat you to it. Now, prepare to taste laser! [another time machine comes, which it opens, and the third SpongeBob and Patrick are falling, screaming] So how...
SpongeBob 4: [The time machine door with the fourth SpongeBob and Patrick] I told you we had to go back farther!
Man Ray: Uh... [Thinks but another time machine comes]
Third Mermaid Man: Up, up, and away! [The third Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy jump out and fall to the ground]
SpongeBob 5: [another time machine opens with the fifth Patrick also] Now, Patrick! [He along with the fifth Patrick pour tartar sauce on the third Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and drop the can on them]
Man Ray: I can't get my head around this. Where are they all coming from? [Man Ray's machine comes] Another machine? [Man Ray comes out]
Second Man Ray: [shoots his own whole time machine and laughs wickedly] I took care of your blasted time machine! [laughs again and flies away]
Man Ray: Uh! I got to sit down and think this through.
Young Mermaid Man: [chains the Second Man Ray] Gotta! You've got plenty of time for thinking in the stony lonesome.
Man Ray: I'm sorry, did you say something? I'm still trying to comprehend what just happened here.
Young Mermaid Man: It's pretty simple, really. You were defeated by a convoy of continuum-cruising crime stoppers. Thank you, SpongeBob and Patrick.
Four SpongeBobs and Two Patricks: You're welcome!
SpongeBob 6 and Patrick 6&#160;: [ another time machine which holds seven SpongeBobs and six Patricks comes] Oh, hi there! Hello! Hello! Hello!
One Other SpongeBob: We just wanted to come back and revisit the day that evil was defeated forever.
SpongeBob 7: [another time machine appears] Hey, how you doing?
Seventh Patrick: We’re here.
Eighth and Ninth SpongeBobs and Patricks: [two time machines appear] Oh, hi there! How you doing?
Tenth SpongeBob and Patrick: Hello! Hello!
Last SpongeBob and Patrick: [more appear] Oh hi there! [More and more appear while the episode pans into outer space] Hello! Hello!


[Episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is cooking Krabby Patties, and hears them sizzle. A big puff of steam comes up. SpongeBob sniffs it in, exhales with content and in the shape of a heart, then kisses it]
SpongeBob: I know I've said this 90 times already but... ♪I love Krabby Patties I think that they are swell. They are the best, there's no contest, and now I'm going to yell.♪ Whew! [SpongeBob fills his holes up with air while Squidward walks to the soda machine with a box of cups, and makes a replica of a house of cards with cups. SpongeBob then becomes like a circle, then exhales, which causes the music to continue] ♪I love Krabby Patties! I think they're swell. They're so neat, and quite a treat, and how I love the way they smell... La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.♪
Squidward: [the house of cards falls down] I knew I shouldn't have gotten out of bed today.
SpongeBob: ♪La la la la laaaaaaa... la la la la!♪
[a tour bus comes out with Ms. Priss dusting the ground, coming out, and blowing a whistle that signals more ladies that are similar to her. Mr. Krabs is at the door wearing a viking helmet for some reason]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, and welcome one, and all your money to ye olde Krusty Krabbie!
Ms. Priss: Come along, sisters. Pay no mind to this crimson abomination! [Crimson is a shade of red. Priss walks into restaurant with sisters in single file behind her, stopping at the register and Squidward, who is reading a "Gossip" Magazine]
Squidward: [Notices Priss and screams]
Ms. Priss: Greetings. Although your establishment seems repugnant and foul in nature, it seems not to offend our sensitivities. It is for that reason, plus the fact that we have been stuck on a tour bus for several days, that my sisters and I would like to eat something here.
Squidward: Okay. But first, let me call the mortician and tell him his uniform's been stolen. [Squidward cracks up] Clothing zinger!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! These wretched hags-I mean, these little lovely ladies-are obviously here to eat. So let's sell 'em- I mean, serve them some delicious Krabby Patties!
Ms. Priss: Well, Mr...um...
Mr. Krabs: [Pulls eyes off like a top hat] Krabs, my lady. [Places them back]
Ms. Priss: Mr. Krabs, you know the basic rules of behaving like a civilized bottom feeder. Perhaps your restaurant isn't quite the hive of degenerates it appears to be, and we had you figured all wrong.
Mr. Krabs: 'Course ya did, because you're about to find out. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [comes with tray of Krabby Patties and sings] ♪Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... I like Krabby Patties! I think they're swell.  I like Krabby Patties, can you not tell?  Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties.  They're so neat.  La la la la la. Sweet to eat.  La la la la la. Really neat. Sweet to eat.  Treat that's neat.  Sweet treat sweet treat. [Utter Gibberish] La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!♪
Ms. Priss: [blows her whistle, causing everyone to flinch and make SpongeBob fall on the floor, Patties and all] Look at this wild hooligan! Running amok, singing, dancing. It's... It's shameless. [Zooms in on Priss's face] Disgusting. Avert your eyes. [grabs onto SpongeBob] Young man, what has caused you to act like this? I must know!
SpongeBob: Actually, ma'am, [holds up a Krabby Patty] it was the absolute fun and deliciousness of a Krabby Patty.
Ms. Priss: Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Yeah, that's right.
Ms. Priss: Well, anything this fun and delicious can't be good. Why, what would this world be if everyone cavorted it in such a manner?
Mr. Krabs: [Outraged] Who are you with your tight lips, raised eyebrows, and conservative clothes?
Ms. Priss: I am Ms. Gristlepuss. We are The United Organization Of Fish Against Things That Are Fun And Delicious. Or, T.U.O.O.F.A.T.T.A.F.A.D. for short. And we are going to ban these so called "Krabby Patties", and close your restaurant forever!
Mr. Krabs: What the...! [SpongeBob cuts in]
SpongeBob: Ms. Gristlepuss, maybe if you were to taste the Krabby Patty for yourself, you too could experience the awesome pleasure.
Ms. Priss: I would soon sprout legs and do the Watusi!
SpongeBob: Ooh! Okay.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, it don't matter anyway, lad. [mockingly] She can't close us down.
[cut to the Krusty Krab locked up and has a "Closed" sign on it]
Mr. Krabs: [Shouting] She closed us down! I'm ruined! [cries] How did it come to this?
Squidward: You called Ms. Gristlepuss a disgusting old prune, then you threatened her with a french-fry strainer.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I didn't know her husband was the chief of police!
[Cut to behind SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs, where Priss and 4 look-alikes stand in front of a muscular police officer going into a police car]
Ms. Priss: Thanks again, Al.
Al: Any time, honey. See you at home for dinner. Mmm! [licks his lips] I'm starving. [drives away] Yee-haw!
Ms. Priss: I just love that man.
[Cut back to Mr. Krabs tugging at the lock on the Krusty Krab teary-eyed, then to SpongeBob and Squidward sitting]
Squidward: How long has he been standing over there?
SpongeBob: [Looks at watch] Uh, 4 days.
[Mr. Krabs walks over]
Mr. Krabs: It's no use! [Raises claws, which become weird-like. Both SpongeBob and Squidward are extremely shocked] [screaming] I'm ruined! [Cries and runs away]
SpongeBob: You know, it's too bad. The only way to make Krabby Patties again would be if you opened a place that didn't look like a restaurant and did it secretly.
Mr. Krabs: [Comes right back] That's it! A secret Krusty Krab! [Whispering] And I know just where to open it.
[Cut to SpongeBob's pineapple house, where Squidward is painting a banner that says "Grand Opening! The SECRET Krusty Krab!". Cut to inside the house. Mr. Krabs is dusting the cash register]
Mr. Krabs: There ya are, Betsy! Good as new! [Kisses register as SpongeBob enters through door]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I-
Mr. Krabs: [Screams in shock]
SpongeBob: Whoa, sorry. I was just wondering-
Mr. Krabs: You know, lad, I can remember a time when people used to knock before entering someone else's home!
SpongeBob: Yeah, but...this [is] my home.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah...
[Patrick walks in]
Patrick: Hey guys!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! Thanks for helping out today!
Patrick: You bet! Where do you want these extra buns? [Holds up an empty bag]
SpongeBob: [Points to bag] Patrick, that bag is totally empty.
[Patrick then lets out a big burp]
Patrick: Oops.
[Cut to a telescope sighting of the Krusty Krab sign, with a plank on it that says "Closed", then to Plankton with a small telescope in hand]
Plankton: Happy day, Karen! That fool Krabs changed the name of his restaurant to the closed Krab! Everyone will think it's closed, and come eat here instead! He'll be ruined by tomorrow! [chuckles] What an idiot!
Karen: It is closed.
Plankton: What?
Karen: Ms. Gristlepuss and her husband banned Krabby Patties for being fun and delicious.
Plankton: Banned? Then that means, my day of reckoning has come at last! I won, I tell you! I've won! And what better way than by default? [Gets a tiny coat and tiny hat off a tiny rack]
Karen: Where are you going?
Plankton: Oh, out to celebrate. [Opens tiny automatic door and exits] Don't wait up for me! [Door closes. Cut to a line to the secret Krusty Krab]
Harold: [Gets pushed] Quit shoving.
Nat: I wasn't shoving. I was going like that and you happened to be standing there.
Harold: That's called shoving.
Nat: No, it isn't.
Harold: Yes, it is.
Nat: Nope.
Harold: Yes!
Nat: Nope! [Plankton arrives]
Plankton: Excuse me, gents! But what's with all the hullabaloo?
Harold: We're just waiting in line to buy a Krabby Patty.
Plankton: Krabby Patty?! [He notices the secret restaurant and steam comes out of him in anger]
Patrick: [Opens door to let out a customer] Thank you, come again! [Closes door, opens tiny hatch] Can I help whoever's next, please? [Plankton cuts to the front of the line with a ladder and climbs up to the hatch] What's the password, please?
Plankton: What are you talking about, you gargantuan buffoon?
Patrick: That's it! [Opens door] Come right in!
Plankton: Curse you! [Falls to the ground. Cut to the restaurant area where people enjoy their Krabby Patties. Gary serves as a waiter here]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: So, would you like to secret-size that for two dollars more?
Customer: Of course!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidwart. You haven't seen any sign of... you know... [whispers] the cops! Have ya?
Squidward: Did you just call me "Squidwart"?
Mr. Krabs: Okay, thanks. I'm gonna see what SpongeBob's doing. [Goes to kitchen] Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob? [SpongeBob is shuddering under his table] SpongeBob? What are you doing under the table?
SpongeBob: If Krabby Patties are illegal now, aren't we breaking the law?
Mr. Krabs: There's an old saying, lad. What doesn't kill ya... usually succeeds in the second attempt.
SpongeBob: But what does that have to do with making Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Nothing! But if don't get out there and start cooking, I'll make ya start taking weekends off!
SpongeBob: [runs from the table] Nooooooo!
Plankton: [spying on Mr. Krabs] So, Mr. Krabs is operating under the table, huh? Well, two can play at that game!
[cut to the phone in the library. A hook attached to a rope is thrown onto the phone and Plankton climbs onto it]
Plankton: [pants] Being a ruthless mastermind sure takes a lot outta ya. [dials a phone number]
Al: Hello, this is officer Al, chief of police.
Plankton: Cops, I need you!
[cuts to police cars going towards the secret restaurant. Miss Priss rides in Al's car]
Miss Priss: [points to restaurant] There! [they arrive and people flee from them. Cut to the entrance. There was a knock on the door]
Patrick: [opens hatch] What's the pas-- [the police bust in and the door falls on Patrick] Nope, that's not it!
[people are screaming as the police invade the house. Plankton lifts up the bun from a Krabby Patty and laughs. Three fish flee the couch and a S.W.A.T. team member beats up the Krabby Patties. They also run over Gary, who is dizzy and retreats into his shell. They pack up Krabby Patties in huge bags]
Miss Priss: You missed one!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Ms. Gristlepuss! I'm sorry we sold Krabby Patties. But do you really have to send us to jail?
Miss Priss: Of course I do! You are a nuisance to my community!
Al: You tell him, honey! Ha! [eats a Krabby Patty] That's my girl!
Miss Priss: [gasp] Al! What are you doing!?
Al: Having some lunch.
Miss Priss: Unhand that sandwich at once! [runs towards him]
SpongeBob: Ms. Gristlepuss! Look out!
Miss Priss: What?
SpongeBob: Your shoe's untied!
Miss Priss: It is? [trips] Oh! [falls down to the ground. The Krabby Patty flies from Al's hand]
Al: [slow-motion] Oooooohhh... [in slow-motion, the Krabby Patty falls into Miss Priss's mouth. She chews and swallows it as Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Al stare at her. She then opens her mouth]
Miss Priss: Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh ♪Aaaaaaahhhhhh!♪ [she turns happy and bursts into song] ♪I like Krabby Patties! I think they're swell. Can you not tell? Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, they're so neat! La la la la la la la la la la♪
SpongeBob: [imitates her voice] ♪La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!♪ [normal voice] Really neat. [chuckles]
Miss Priss: ♪Sweet to eat!♪
SpongeBob: ♪Treat that's neat!♪
Miss Priss &amp; SpongeBob: [utter gibberish] ♪Aaaaaaannndddd...♪ [they drop to the ground] ♪dismount!♪
Miss Priss: That was wonderful! I... I feel... reborn!
SpongeBob: Does that mean you're not sending us to the slammer?
Miss Priss: Of course, my dear boy. I'm a kinder, gentler fish. And I owe it all to you.
SpongeBob: Don't forget the spatula! [Mr. Krabs, Miss Priss, Al, and the others laugh. Al goes towards Miss Priss]
Miss Priss: Don't push it, Al.
Plankton: [lifts bun from a Krabby Patty] Darn it! Argh! Once again, so close and yet so far! When am I gonna- oh! [He hides in the patty as Miss Priss picks it up]
Miss Priss: Well, I think I'll have another one. [She bites into it, revealing Plankton in the burger's core]
Plankton: Oh dear. [He screams as Miss Priss goes in for a second bite. A "The End" card is shown and a gulp sound can be heard]


[The episode begins at Bikini Bottom High School. A teenage fish walking past gets a doughnut thrown on him in which two teenage fish laugh and then spits on his friend's face. Another teenage male fish with headphones attempts to say hi to the teenage female fish who pass him while chatting but they only remove them and put them on the floor and walk off. A teen bully fish does a wedgie to a teenage nerdy fish who screams but the nerdy fish twists his nipple really hard causing him to run off crying. While all this is happening, Pearl and her friend is sitting down on a bench talking]
Pearl: Boy, do I love high school. [small laugh]. You know what? Someday we're gonna remember all this, and we're gonna look back and say... Remember?
Pearl's friend: [laughing] Speaking of remembering, you didn't forget the Bikini Bottom High School Dance is tomorrow night, did you?
Pearl: [Joyfully] Of course I didn't forget. I'm so excited.
Pearl's friend: [laughs] Me, too!
[They both laugh until Pearl's friend stops in shock]
Pearl's friend: [In horror] Barnacle!
Pearl: What!?
Pearl's friend: Pearl I'm gonna say this as touchily as possible. [pointing] There is a hideous barnacle growing out of the side of your face!
Pearl: [Shocked] Where!?
[Her friend moves her face so she can see it]
Pearl's friend: There!
[Pearl notices the barnacle growing and starts screaming. So much that the entire Bikini Bottom is looking at her.]
Pearl's friend: Pearl, it's not really bad as you...
[She screams again. All of the high school students are looking at her again. Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab; SpongeBob appears to be whistling while mopping the floors]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [stops mopping] Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Didn't you already mop this area?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Affirmative, captain!
Mr. Krabs: Well, then, why would you mop it again?
SpongeBob: Why wouldn't I? [there is a pause]
Mr. Krabs: Good point.
[Pearl enters the Krusty Krab in tears]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon?
Pearl: Oh, Daddy! It's terrible. The school dance is this weekend.
Mr. Krabs: Oooh, that is terrible. [he shivers] Makes my shell crawl just thinking about it. Bleugh!
Pearl: No, daddy! Don't you understand?! The terrible part is that I can't go to the dance!
Mr. Krabs: [comes closer] Why ever not?
Pearl: Because I have a hideous barnacle growing on the side of my face!
Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now, calm down there, my little Pearl. I'm sure it can't be half as awful as you... [pus is shown oozing out of the barnacle; Krabs screams] Great rusty hinges of Davy Jones' Locker!
Pearl: We have to get rid of it, no matter what it takes!
Mr. Krabs: Anything for me beloved angel!
Pearl: Oh, okay. I need an appointment with a dermatologist, a trip to the spa, expensive creams and lotions, and probably some other kind of... [Krabs stops her, angrily]
Mr. Krabs: I meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund. [this causes Pearl to cry again, soaking a table Harold and Nat are having lunch at]
Harold: You know what? Let's go across the street to the Chum Bucket.
Nat: I heard they have better weather over there. [They leave the Krusty Krab] 
Mr. Krabs: [chases after them but fails] No! Wait! [Pearl continues to wail] This is starting to eat away me profit margin. If I don't come up with a solution fast, it's gonna cost me more than a couple cases of cold cream. [He notices SpongeBob mopping past him]
SpongeBob: [sings]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob stops] How would you like to... [He salutes] At ease! [SpongeBob drops his hand] How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and rid his beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?
SpongeBob: I will do you this favor, sir chum, never fear!
[bubble transition to Pearl walking with SpongeBob]
Pearl: I don't know, SpongeBob. The school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute!
SpongeBob: Don't fear, Pearl. We'll get rid of this barnacle in no time! I know just what to do!
Pearl: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: One time, my friend Patrick had this barnacle the size of an extra large Krabby Patty right at the center of his forehead! Anyway, I fixed it so we never saw that barnacle again.
Pearl: How?
SpongeBob: I took him to see a hypnotist.
Pearl: You took Patrick to a hypnotist?
SpongeBob: No. The barnacle. It became convinced it was a pelican and flew south for the winter. We never saw that pelican again.
Pearl: I thought you said it was a barnacle.
SpongeBob: What did I say?
Pearl: Pelican.
SpongeBob: [pauses for a second] He was a really good hypnotist.
[bubble transition to Pearl's room]
SpongeBob: Now just remain calm and it's all over before you know it.
Pearl: Are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the... barnacle?
SpongeBob: [laughing] Hypnosis? No! Hold still now. [hits the barnacle]
Pearl: Is everything okay?
SpongeBob: [shows broken spatula] I don't think this is going to work. [Brings in a shovel] This ol' weather beaten shovel is gonna do the work! [hits the barnacle]
Pearl: Did it come off?
SpongeBob: [the shovel is stuck in his head] Gettin' there.
[Next, SpongeBob tries removing the barnacle with a jackhammer.]
Pearl: SpongeBob, how much longer?
SpongeBob: Oh... shouldn't be too much longer. [the jackhammer disintegrates] Personally, you could take a break off if you'd like.
Pearl: Good idea. I'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water.
SpongeBob: Okay. [he throws the jackhammer aside, which lands in a pile of other broken tools]
[In the bathroom, Pearl is putting some soap on a towel and scrubbing it on her barnacle. She suddenly screams and SpongeBob hears it]
SpongeBob: [walks into the bathroom] Pearl! [Pearl is seen with soap covering her face] Pearl, what happened?
Pearl: There's more! [the soap slides off her face, exposing lots of barnacles everywhere]
SpongeBob: [shrieks] I mean, you're right. There's more.
Pearl: [puzzled] All I did was wash with soap and water!
SpongeBob: [examines the soap] Hmm... Water and... this soap?
Pearl: Yes, but why?
SpongeBob: [sniffs the bar of soap] Because this soap smells so wonderful! That's why. Hmm, I know this fragrance from somewhere. [keeps sniffing the soap] Oh, I'm sorry, did you want a whiff?
Pearl: No.
SpongeBob: [continues sniffing] More for me!
[we cut to the living room, where Pearl is seen with her face smothered in concealing cream. She mumbles something]
SpongeBob: [holding the jar of cream] No, I think one jar of concealing cream is enough. Don't worry, Pearl, no one will notice a thing. [Mr. Krabs enters the house with the groceries]
Mr. Krabs: [humming] Pearl, I'm home! [screams loudly]
SpongeBob: Something wrong, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized... [sweetly] it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl. [Pearl mumbles again] Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of. [Mr. Krabs walks over to a safe full of diamonds and jumps in] Me jewels!
[later, Pearl is in the bathroom crying again]
SpongeBob: Pearl? [knocks on the bathroom door] Pearl, you've been in the bathroom crying for three hours now. You can't stay in there forever.
Pearl: [from inside] I'm not going to the dance!
SpongeBob: Okay, I'm coming in! [opens the door, which causes a flood of tears to gush out into the hallway. SpongeBob swims against the current and makes it in] Look at the bright side, Pearl. At least you can still play the piano.
Pearl: And what exactly would that do to me?
SpongeBob: I have no idea. [Pearl bawls] Don't worry, Pearl. I'll fix your crying!
Pearl: How?
SpongeBob: Well, I'm sure if I'll think strong enough, something will pop up. [something DOES pop up, and it's more barnacles] Oops, I didn't mean it like that. [sees the bar of soap and picks it up] Hey, it's that delicious-smelling soap again. [starts sniffing the soap again]
Pearl: [snatches it away]
SpongeBob: Okay. Where do you keep your soap?
Pearl: In the basement. Duh, where else? [scrubs her face more]
[Torch in hand, SpongeBob is entering the darkened basement when he hears a strange noise]
SpongeBob: [echoes] Hello? [SpongeBob jumps when he hears the echo, but keeps going until he hears another noise and turns around] Something there? Pearl?! [His torch goes out, making it completely dark. SpongeBob sees a door opening and goes through it to find Mr. Krabs, trying to pull a stuck handle] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this! [they both pull at the handle until it moves] There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what is this thing?
Mr. Krabs: Why, it's my old soap press!
SpongeBob: Soap press?
Mr. Krabs: That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob: Leftover Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: [tosses a Krabby Patty into the machine] Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap! [the new soap falls off the conveyor belt into a basket] Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free.
SpongeBob: [picks up one of the soap bars and sniffs it] Ohhhh, that explains why it smells so familiar! I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. If Pearl finds out that you...
Pearl: [lividly] I've been using soap made out of Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patty essence.
Pearl: That's grease!
Mr. Krabs: Well, if you want to split hairs, I suppose-
Pearl: [furiously] Daddy! [throws soap at her father]
Mr. Krabs: [runs away in fear] Got to go, you kids have fun!
Pearl: [bursts into tears and rubs her eyes making squeaky sounds] I'm never gonna be able to get these barnacles off! My young life is ruined forever.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Pearl. I said I'm not going to let Mr. Krabs down, and I'm not going to. What do you think of that?
Pearl: [wails] The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle, my-
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, Pearl, say that again!
Pearl: Okay. The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle.
SpongeBob: Okay, you can stop. I think I have an idea...
[cut to SpongeBob on a ladder and Pearl beside him in her room]
Pearl: Are you done yet?
SpongeBob: [climbs down the ladder] All set! Close your eyes and get ready to sparkle! One, two, three. [turns Pearl's chair to face the mirror. Pearl has blue diamonds on her face to hide her barnacles] And, ta-da. What do you think?
Pearl: I don't know, SpongeBob - what would my friends say?
SpongeBob: [walks her to the living room] We shall see shortly.
Pearl: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: [opens the front door] Shh. Trust me.
[Three of Pearl's friends, a green fish, a blue fish, and a pink-orange fish, enter the house]
Blue fish: Pearl, we're here to pick you up to the- wow! Pearl, you look amazing!
Pearl: I do?
Blue fish: Well, not amazing. Sparkly and shiny and amazing!
Pearl: Whee! To the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
Pearl and her friends: [laughing] Let's go! [they run out of the house, and SpongeBob shuts the door behind them]
SpongeBob: You have a good time, carefree teens!
Mr. Krabs: [screams and exits his jewel safe] My jewels! SpongeBob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone! Seen it?
SpongeBob: Of course! Pearl's wearing it to the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
Mr. Krabs: Help! Police! Thief! [runs out of the house, running through the door] Stop that whale!
SpongeBob: I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't let him down, and I have partially fulfilled that promise.

[SpongeBob laughs then tries opening the door to the Krusty Krab but can't because it's locked]
Mr. Krabs: Get out of the way, boy! [SpongeBob flies off the door and bounces into Mr. Krabs] Me building's been condemned, boy! We got ourselves a nematode infestation! [Nematodes come and eat the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs faints]
SpongeBob: But... the best day ever starts at the Krusty Krab! Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave! [nematodes eat his pants] Ohhhh! Guys, you're ruining the [off-key] best day... [clears throat] Wait, no. [off-key] Best day... [plays his nose as a flute. The nematodes line up. When SpongeBob stops, the nematodes walk up] Huh? [plays the 'best day ever' tune. The nematodes chatter excitedly. They follow SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Keep playing, lad! Take them devil's sons of the sea away from me restaurant! [later, SpongeBob stops playing and falls over due to being tired. The nematodes fall asleep, also. SpongeBob's watch beeps]
SpongeBob: Whoa! I gotta get to Sandy's! [scene cuts to Sandy's treedome. SpongeBob opens up her door then jumps behind a bush] Wait ‘til Sandy gets a load of these adhesive karate gloves. Hyah! [karate chops the box the gloves were in. Then he chuckles and jumps onto the top of the treedome and sticks due to his gloves. He moves above her tree and falls through it and lands on a tree branch, then jumps at her] Hyah! [Sandy ducks and SpongeBob hits her buckets of water]
Sandy: [standing on a ladder, using a bucket to catch water in] SpongeBob, what on Earth are you doing?!
SpongeBob: Oh, just a little something I like to call karate!
Sandy: I can't right now, SpongeBob. I got a leak in my roof the size of a full-grown quarter horse!
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm. I see. Okay, then. I'll come back later. [walks off, but then reappears by Sandy and tries to karate chop her]
Sandy: Knock... it... off! [punches SpongeBob up high. The leak stops] It stopped? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Sandy: Hang on! I'm going to get some sealant and patch and trowel! [runs into her treedome]
SpongeBob: [groans] Oh. [slips out of his glove and falls. Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking to Jellyfish Fields] Oh, no Krabby Patties, no karate. But at least I still have jellyfishing with... Hey, there he is now! [sees Patrick chasing a jellyfish] Wait for me, Patrick. I've got a brand-new... [Patrick is crying] What's wrong, Patrick?
Patrick: I broke my net! [sobbing]
SpongeBob: Well, lucky for you, I brought my old net. [Patrick grabs it]
Patrick: For me? [giggles]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I won't be needing it now that I got my brand-new... [Patrick's jellyfish net breaks. He cries]
Patrick: [bawling] SpongeBob! I broke... could I use this one? [points to SpongeBob's new net]
SpongeBob: Well, actually, Patrick, that's my brand-new net.
Patrick: Yeah? [cut to later where SpongeBob is waiting for his net while Patrick uses it]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's my turn, now. [Patrick ignores him] Hey, Patrick? Pat, old buddy. P-Patrick? It's-it's my turn now. [sighs] I guess I'll see you at the concert. [cut to SpongeBob walking at night to the concert, sadly] It's the best day ever. It's the best day ever. Oh, this best day ever isn't going so good. [takes out notebook and pencil and cancels "Jellyfishing w/ Patrick"] No work, no karate, no jellyfishing. Hey, I still have Squidward's concert! I won't let this one slip through my fingers. [cut to Squidward bawling outside the Bikini Bottom Recreation Center, in his uniform] Hey, Squidward. Squidward, what's wrong?
Squidward: The concert is ruined! My reed is shot. [shows it] See? I'm finished!
SpongeBob: [slaps Squidward] Pull yourself together, man! I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one!
Squidward: [sobbing] But my reed! [SpongeBob pulls one of his front teeth out and uses it as a reed]
SpongeBob: Now play!
Squidward: But... [SpongeBob slaps him]
SpongeBob: I said play! [Squidward plays]
Squidward: Not bad. [SpongeBob slaps him again]
SpongeBob: Now get in there and give me a concert to remember! [suddenly, an usher grabs him]
Usher: Where do you think you're going, kid?
SpongeBob: I'm going to see Squidward play his clarinet. Today's my best day ever!
Usher: Where's your ticket?
SpongeBob: One ticket, coming right up, cap'n! [searches his pocket] Must be here somewhere. [takes off his pants and dumps out what is in it] I don't have a ticket.
Usher: No ticket, no entry.
SpongeBob: But...
Usher: No ticket, no entry! [cut to a SpongeBob puppet on strings coming down]
SpongeBob Puppet: Oh, dear! I don't have a ticket. But I want to go to the show. Hmmm... what should I do? Oh, I know. I'll just sneak in the back door. [leaves]
Usher: Oh, no, you don't! [runs after him as SpongeBob climbs down the wall, laughing]
SpongeBob: SpongeBob, you are so... [walks backwards into an usher puppet]
Usher Puppet: Ticket, please. [Later, SpongeBob, wearing a ski mask, is climbing up the side of the building and through the vent on the roof. He uses a flamethrower to cut his way through a door, which is actually the entry doors. The usher kicks him away from the building. Cut to later, where Mrs. Puff drives up in her boat and gets out, walking up to the usher]
Usher: Ticket, ma'am.
Mrs. Puff: Certainly. [reaches into her purse. She hears some giggling and takes out what it is] SpongeBob?
Usher: You? This time, I'm gonna... Wait a minute! Did you say SpongeBob? SpongeBob SquarePants? You're on the VIP list. [the usher carries SpongeBob on a pillow to his seat]
SpongeBob: [gasps] A reserved seat? Next to my friends? I made it! All I have to do is sit down and... [everyone applauds as the curtains close, and SpongeBob completely loses it. yells in frustration as everyone looks at him in confusion] NOOOOOO! (jumps on stage and tears the curtain) No! It is not over!
Fish: Huh?
SpongeBob: This was supposed to be my perfect day. But then everything... [a fish gets up and starts to leave. screams] SIT DOWN! [the fish does so] Then everything turned to doo-doo. [Mr. Krabs, Patrick and Sandy go upstage with him]
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No, it's not okay! [his yelling makes Mr. Krabs and Patrick flinch] This was gonna be my best day ever, starting with doing the best job in the world: working at the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: Boy, you saved me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Yeah, I guess so. But then I was gonna do karate with Sandy.
Sandy: I know, but you saved the treedome! Pretty cool, if you ask me.
SpongeBob: Well, I suppose. But then I was gonna go jellyfishing with Patrick.
Patrick: But then you... Uh, what'd you do again?
Squidward: And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust.
Mr. Krabs: You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things.
SpongeBob: [starting to feel calm] It's not?
Mr. Krabs: No. [chuckles] It's about us!
SpongeBob: It is?
Mr. Krabs: Yep. And since you did such a good job, we wanna make it up to you.
SpongeBob: You do?
Mr. Krabs: So, just tell us anything your little heart desires, and it's yours. [SpongeBob smiles and scene cuts to Mr. Krabs coming on stage with the light shining on him] Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the Bikini Bottom Players proudly present a very expensive production of... "The Best Day Ever!" And it better be good for all it's costing me.
SpongeBob: ♪My perfect job starts my perfect day.♪ [flips a patty] ♪Then it's time to kick back, relax and play.♪ [practices karate with Sandy. She kicks him. He land next to Patrick. Jellyfishes comes up in the scene]

[At the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money a dozen times, and it still comes up short. Profits are down. Oh, I feel sorry for me self. [walks out of office]
Squidward: Would you like a drink with that order?
Wobbles: Oh no, thanks. I got me one of those new KelpShakes before I came in here.
Squidward: That comes out to two dollars even.
Wobbles: Wow, what a steal.
Mr. Krabs: What the...why didn't that guy order a deliciously over-priced fountain beverage with his krabby patty?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we haven't sold a single soda in days.
Mr. Krabs: [Shocked] What? Why not? [Mr. Krabs sees SpongeBob slurping a soda can loudly] All right, boy, it's done! You're gonna suck the whole cup down your gullet if you're not careful.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr Krabs, it's just that this KelpShake tastes so good.
Mr. Krabs: KelpShake?
SpongeBob: Look around ya. Everyone's enjoying a delicious KelpShake. [everyone is slurping their KelpShakes] Mm-mm. I'll be right back, Mr Krabs. I'm gonna get a refill.
Mr. Krabs: Refill? That's it. Listen up, everybody! New rule: No outside drinks. No exceptions! [everyone leaves with their KelpShakes]
Squidward: That's telling them.
Mr. Krabs: Grr. I better get to the bottom of this. [Squidward secretly sips his KelpShake when Mr. Krabs leaves. Mr. Krabs walks outside] Ah! A new store! [store is shaped like a KelpShake] On my block! Taking my customers. [gasps] Pearl. [Pearl walks by while drinking a KelpShake] Me own flesh and blood. How could you do this to your papa?!
Pearl: What are you talking about, Dad?
Mr. Krabs: I'm talking about this. [points to KelpShake]
Pearl: Once you taste the secret goodness of a KelpShake... [slurping] You can't have just one.
Mr. Krabs: Let me see that. [tries taking the KelpShake from Pearl, but she pulls it back]
Pearl: Buy your own.
Mr. Krabs: Why I wouldn't give them a cent.
Pearl: I feel sorry for you.
Mr. Krabs: Then you do understand. [starts to cry and grovels at her feet]
Pearl: Dad, you're embarrassing me. [drags her dad a few more feet before prying him off] Oh, get away. [Mr. Krabs is still crying]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no! Confound you, new KelpShake store. What's your secret? [gasps] Of course. Plankton, I bet he's behind this. A-ha! I knew you were behind this!
Plankton: Pardon me, I've done nothing wrong.
Mr. Krabs: Then how do you explain this? [points to the KelpShake restaurant]
Plankton: Holy Moley, how'd that happen?
Mr. Krabs: Don't try that with me, Plankton. This new store is ruining me business.
Plankton: Really? Wait a minute?! That's my job! [groans] Blast it! It's bad enough I have to compete with this joker. Now there's this?! KelpShakes.
Mr. Krabs: Wow. I guess you're really not behind this after all. Plankton, they have... a secret formuler.
Plankton: No, not another secret. And if there's a secret, I want to know about it! [rumbling]
Mr. Krabs: Oh!
Plankton: [gasps as one KelpShake store multiplies itself to have two KelpShake stores] They're multiplying. Why, they're on every corner.
Mr. Krabs: Block after block.
Plankton: They're everywhere.
Mr. Krabs: [a KelpShake store falls on both of them] We've got to do something about this. [cut to later where Mr. Krabs and Plankton walk into a KelpShake store] You sure this is going to work?
Plankton: Just stick to the plan.
Mr. Krabs: [whistles] Oh, let's see, let's see. Ah, there you are. [spots an 'employees only' sign. Whispers to Plankton] Plankton, I think I found the kitchen.
Plankton: Let's do this thing!
Mr. Krabs: Here goes. Wa-choo! [sneezes on a mom and daughter] I'm sorry, I have a bit of a [gasping] ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...choo!! [continues sneezing on everything. he sneezes Plankton at the door window, but Plankton was unable to get into the kitchen]
Employee: Eww. [sprays a cleaner at Plankton]
Plankton: [screams] My eye, my eye, my eye! [Mr. Krabs and Plankton run out and hide behind the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: I think we lost them. Well, you got any more bright ideas?
Plankton: Of course I do. [cut to nighttime where Mr. Krabs and Plankton are wearing black ski clothes]
Mr. Krabs: All set, Plankton?
Plankton: You better believe it. This high-powered mechanical bio-arm I invented should pry those restaurant doors open nice and easy. [presses a button that makes the hand move. The hand short-circuits] What the barnacles? Come on, you piece of garbage. [presses the button many times. The mechanical bio-arm slaps Plankton a bunch of times] Ouch! Uncle! Uncle!
Mr. Krabs: [Sighs] If you want anything done right, you've got to do it yourself. [takes out a crowbar and tries to open the doors, but his back pops] Oh, me back. [moaning]
Plankton: [whispering] Krabs, pipe down. You're gonna soil our plans if you wake up the watchdog. [guardworm is sleeping]
Mr. Krabs: Never mind that. What about SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr Krabs. Hi...Plankton? Uh, Mr Krabs, I'm a little confused. Don't you and Plankton hate each other?
Mr. Krabs: Of course we do.
SpongeBob: Then why is he in your fist? [Mr. Krabs and Plankton come up with a good explanation]
Mr. Krabs: Uh...we've gone into business together. You see, SpongeBob, we were hired, uh...to fix this door.
Plankton: Now we have to fix the roof. [winks]
Mr. Krabs: That's right. That's right. We have to fix the roof. It's, it's, it's leaking. [crickets chirping]
SpongeBob: Well, good luck with that. See ya. [cut to later where Mr. Krabs is using jackhammer to get into the roof]
Plankton: Keep her going, Krabs. At this rate, we'll have the Kelpshake's recipe faster than you can say... [speaker comes up from under the roof]
Speaker: You have three seconds before spontaneous combustion. [a laser gun comes out]
Plankton: Let's beat it!
Mr. Krabs: No kidding. [runs]
Plankton: Wait, you forgotten... [gets zapped and disintegrates. Cut to the next day where a line of people are ordering KelpShakes. Plankton is under one of the tiles on the floor. He laughs maniacally until the customers step the tile, causing him to get squished, making him scream. Cut to Mr. Krabs lowering Plankton by a rope through the vent. Plankton is about to take a sip of a KelpShake when the customer takes a big sip first, swallowing Plankton. Plankton opens the customers mouth and is raised up through the vent. Cut to Mr. Krabs blowing Plankton through a hose and out of a sink pipe. When Plankton gets out, he is covered with KelpShake juice and gets drowned in the disposal] I'm throwing in the towel, Krabs! All these convoluted plans are getting us nowhere. And to top it all off, I'm the only one that's taking the heat!
Mr. Krabs: What's that suppose to mean?
Plankton: I don't see you on the front lines. Sure, let me do all the work, while you just sit back like the fat gorilla you are!!
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Plankton] Who you are calling a gorilla, you one-cent, one-eyed bottom-feeder!?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if you want a KelpShake, why don't you just buy one? [slurps his KelpShake]
Mr. Krabs: [Scared] Buy one?! [cut to later where Mr Krabs and Plankton are in line at the KelpShake store]
Customer: I'll have one KelpShake, please.
Mr. Krabs: I don't know about this, Plankton.
Plankton: It's easy. Just smile and hand the cashier the money.
Cashier: Can I help you?
Plankton: Good luck.
Mr. Krabs: Hi there. Uh, could I get one KelpShake?
Cashier: Sure, that'll be one dollar.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, okay. [gets out a dollar and slowly hands it to the cashier]
Cashier: [cash register dings] Thank you. [The cashier tries to take the dollar but Mr. Krabs is not letting go of his dollar.] Sir, please let go of the bill.
Plankton: Release your grip, man. Do it! [Mr. Krabs does so and groans as the money is taken. The cashier puts the dollar in the register and hands the KelpShake to Mr. Krabs]
Cashier: Enjoy.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks. [runs out laughing] I can't believe we did it.
Plankton: Oh, believe it, Krabs. Now let's get to the lab and find out what this stuff is made of. [scene cuts to the KelpShake on a plate where a sample of the drink goes through a tube, into chemistry bottles, and finally into Karen where she begins a D-N-A scan] What's the secret ingredient, Karen?
Karen: Well, it appears that the main ingredient is, Kelp Juice.
Plankton &amp; Mr. Krabs: Just kelp juice?
Mr. Krabs: And to think this whole time I could've been selling these meself!
Plankton: You? What about me? If anyone, I deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff.
Mr. Krabs: [removes the glass container and takes kelp juice] No way, pipsqueak. This gold mine is mine.
Plankton: Not if I can help it. [jumps at Mr. Krabs, but goes between his eyes and splatters into the wall] Ow.
Mr. Krabs: [cackling] Nice try. [about to take a sip]
Karen: I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's another ingredient.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, I paid good money for this thing. Of course I'm gonna drink it. [takes a sip then spits it out] What the...? I don't get what the big deal is. This tastes like a wet gym sock.
Plankton: Really? Let me try that. [Plankton sips the drink and puckers his lips] Actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste.
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm. [sips again] Hey, you're right. This ain't half bad. [takes another sip and laughs] This is amazing.
Plankton: Well, don't be selfish. [sips and laughs] Oh yeah.
Karen: Oh no.
Plankton: [he sips in the rest of the drink until he sucks in the cup] Krabs, we're all out of juice.
Mr. Krabs: Well, we gotta get more.
Karen: You're making a big mistake.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, phooey. You don't know what you're talking about. [he walks out with Plankton] KelpShake, KelpShake. Oh how I love a KelpShake.
SpongeBob: [runs up crying covered in yellowish-green fur] What's happening to me? [Mr. Krabs and Plankton gasp when they see SpongeBob covered in green kelp and he's naked] They've shut down the KelpShake restaurants! [nearly crying as he runs off]
Plankton &amp; Mr. Krabs: Huh? [They both see workers sucking out all the liquid in the KelpShake restaurant that says CLOSED FOREVER]
Hazmat #1: It'll take decades to clean this hazardous material up.
Hazmat #2: I sure do feel sorry for whoever drank this. [Mr. Krabs screams as he is growing yellowish-green kelp fur just like Plankton is, then Plankton screams]
Plankton: Look at us!
Mr. Krabs: Now what are we going to do?
Plankton: I don't know about you, [Plankton takes out a mini helicopter propeller] but I'm going back to what I do best. Stealing your recipe. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, wait a minute! Plankton!
Plankton: [he flies into Mr. Krabs office where the safe is, he tosses the propeller and laughs] Come to papa. [Mr. Krabs opens the door]
Mr. Krabs: Hold it right there. You're not going anywhere... [He opens the safe] without a ten second head start.
Plankton: It's good to be home.
Mr. Krabs: You said it.
Plankton: [he runs off as Mr. Krabs begins to chase him] I love being hated.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, get back here you little booger! [laughs]


[The episode begins with a big baby bottle that says "SquarePants and Star BabySitting." SpongeBob paints on the bottle and Squidward reads the bottle.]
Squidward: [reading the bottle] "SquarePants and Star Babysitting"? Oh, please. What do you two nitwits know about taking care of babies?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Just watch!
[SpongeBob and Patrick pull out powder.]
Squidward: Huh?
[SpongeBob and Patrick begin to put powder on Squidward while SpongeBob pulls supplies out of the bottle.]
SpongeBob: [pulls out a safety pin] Safety pin! [puts it in the powder cloud before pulling out a bottle of ointment] Ointment! [applies the ointment to the powder cloud] 
[SpongeBob and Patrick stop putting powder on Squidward. When the powder cloud disappears we see him wearing a baby bonnet and a diaper and holding a rattle.]
Squidward: Goo. [sadly] Goo... [cries like a baby until SpongeBob sticks a pacifier in his mouth. Squidward starts sucking on the pacifier]
SpongeBob: Aww, such a good wittle Squiddy.
[Squidward then realizes he is acting like a baby, so he jumps up and spits out the pacifier, which bounces off SpongeBob and lands in Patrick's mouth. Patrick then starts sucking on the pacifier.]
Squidward: No one in their right mind would ever hire you as babysitters!
Mother: Yoo-hoo! Babysitters! [SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward look towards the front of Conch Street where they see a woman waving to them] I could use some babysitters here!
SpongeBob: [Patrick squeals] Oh, boy!
[SpongeBob brings the baby bottle with him and runs into Squidward. Patrick hops onto the bottle before Squidward falls on his face. He then crosses his arms. SpongeBob and Patrick make it to the woman's house in front of Conch Street.]
SpongeBob:  "SquarePants and Star Babysitters" at your service!
Patrick: We sit on babies!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Not literally.
Patrick: Yeah, not in Italy.
Mother: [waves goodbye with her hat] Now you kids behave and listen to the babysitters. Bye now!
SpongeBob: Bye! [SpongeBob closes the door and sees all the babies. One baby is climbing the stair railing, another baby is chewing on a football, a baby comes out of the floorboard, a baby comes flying with a balloon until pops, and the baby falls into the floorboard, two babies are playing with the lamp, one baby is on the chair, and another baby falls in a TV.] Whoa! A whole liege of little darlings. [SpongeBob and Patrick put on helmets with rattles on them. They start shaking them.] Alright, Patrick, you take East plank, and I'll take the West, and we'll try to establish a map zone in the middle. 
Patrick: Hahahaha! These babies are no match for my... toddler style! [Patrick pulls out a pair of bottles in chains that they look like nunchucks. Patrick starts whipping the nunchuck bottles around and makes ninja sounds until he falls on his face.] Ow.
[We cut to Patrick watching the babies cry until he makes a funny face. The babies stop crying and start laughing. Patrick makes more funny faces until he stops and makes the babies cry. SpongeBob has five spoons on his head until Patrick puts another one on his head. With six spoons, Patrick lifts SpongeBob up and dips the spoons in baby food. SpongeBob feeds the babies until they stopped crying. A baby is seen on the shelf, knocking plates over. SpongeBob catches the planes, so they won't break. The baby falls off the shelf SpongeBob screams and manages to catch the baby. SpongeBob is relieved that he caught the baby, but the plates fall over the floor. The babies now are crying once again until their diapers stink. SpongeBob puts a close pin on his nose and flips them over with a giant spatula.]
SpongeBob: [whistles] Bring her down!
[Patrick uses a claw to grab the babies. SpongeBob removes the diapers with a vacuum cleaner. He puts powder on their butts until he puts new diapers on them. Patrick releases them and SpongeBob flips them on their beds while the babies fall asleep. SpongeBob puts them to bad and high fives Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Yeah. 
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shh... 
[Bubble transition to the next scene where the mother comes home. She puts her hat on the coat rack and notices SpongeBob reading a story.]
SpongeBob: And they all lived happily ever after inside an oyster shell.  
Mother: Aww... Thank you, SquarePants and Star.  
[The mother hands them money. Patrick takes it and puts it in his pocket while he is sleeping. Bubble transition to the next scene where SpongeBob and Patrick are looking for someone for babysitting.]
SpongeBob: Babysitting! 
Patrick: Skinny or chunky! Clean or funky! 
SpongeBob: We won't get paid if your kid's mislaid!
Mary: Oh, boys, right here! Oh, I could use a babysitter!
Patrick: Yay!
SpongeBob: Ooh! [They rush towards Mary] While you go out, and dance, and drevel...
Patrick: ...While we watch your little devil!
[SpongeBob and Patrick swirl her around.]
Mary: Yes! Thank you! [hugs Patrick] Thank you! [hugs SpongeBob then runs off]
SpongeBob: Wait! Where's the baby? 
Mary: She's inside! I'm free! I'm free! Hahahahaha! 
[Mary hops happily while SpongeBob and Patrick look confused at each other. But they both shrug and enters the house.]
SpongeBob: Baby! [shakes the rattle] Baby?
Patrick: [holds up a pillow] Is this the baby? 
SpongeBob: Hmm? No, I, I don't think so. 
Patrick: Huh. Oh! [holds up a lamp] This looks like a nice baby girl. [turns the lamp on] 
SpongeBob: She's nice, but she's not a baby. [Patrick throws the lamp.] Wait a minute. [SpongeBob runs to a wheelchair and looks down.] I found the baby. 
[SpongeBob turns the wheelchair around and shows Patrick the baby. But it wasn't a baby, it was Mary's mother from "Chocolate with Nuts." She is shown asleep and it startles Patrick.]
Patrick: Eek! That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen! 
SpongeBob: Patrick, all babies are beautiful. Even the ugly ones, and we don't know the baby's name is. 
Patrick: She looks like she's been in the tub too long. Let's call her Baby Prunes. 
SpongeBob: What a pretty name! Little Baby Prunes.
[They both laugh until Mary's mother wakes up and screams as she sees SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Mary's Mother: Who are you?! Where's lazy Mary?! 
Patrick: The baby can talk! 
Mary's Mother: Help! Help! It's a robbery! 
[SpongeBob puts a pacifier in her mouth.]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, Baby Prunes is just mimicking what she's heard. It's just baby talk. She's babbling. 
Mary's Mother: [spits out the pacifier] I'm not babbling, you bone heads! 
Patrick: Feeding time! [pulls out a spoon full of food] Here comes the airplane. [makes train noises and puts the food into Mary's mother's mouth, but she spits it out] Yum. Playtime! [Patrick dumps out some blocks and throws the bottle away.] Kids love to build things with blocks! 
Mary's Mother: [chuckles] Oh, I'll build something alright.
[We cut a bubble transition to all the blocks built into a jail with SpongeBob and Patrick in it. SpongeBob writes on the wall. Inside the play jail, there is a toilet, a pipe, a bunch, and a shelf filled with books. SpongeBob checks his watch.]
Mary's Mother: Put me down you yellow scouring pad! Unhand me! [cuts to SpongeBob walking to a spot in Mary's house and Patrick pulls out a baby cradle.] No! [SpongeBob puts Mary's Mother in the cradle.] Get me out of here! [SpongeBob puts on a baby hat Mary's Mother tucks her in a blanket and staples it to the cradle.] Ow! Ugh! Ouch! [Screams.} 
SpongeBob: Oooo! Who's a colicky baby? It's you! [SpongeBob tickles Mary's Mother in the neck with one finger.] Coochy coochy coo!  
Mary's Mother: Bleh. 
SpongeBob: I'll go up and prepare a bath for Baby Prunes for when she wakes up. 
Patrick: Okay. While you're doing that I'll just space out. Uhhh...
[As SpongeBob goes upstairs, Patrick's eyes turn upwards and drools. Mary's Mother looks at Patrick with his eyes upwards, and then escapes from the cradle by using a secret door at the bottom of the cradle, and runs away chuckling evilly. Meanwhile, at upstairs SpongeBob is at Mary's bathroom. SpongeBob turns on a faucet on a bathtub.]
SpongeBob: Strange... There don't seem to be any baby items in here. Hmm... [looks in a cabinet to find not baby items but old woman stuff.] Okay, pills, pills, dentures, more pills, hemorrhoid cream. [SpongeBob closes the cabinet but then notices a little birthday note stuck on the bottom left corner of the cabinet.] "Happy birthday to mother on her 137th birthday." Aw. [gasps and realizes the truth] 137th birthday?! Ohhhh! Baby Prunes isn't a baby, she's an old lady! 
[Meanwhile, Mary's mother is trying to escape from Mary's house using her tongue to unlock the door]
Mary's Mother: Come on, come on! [Just then Patrick comes along with his eyes still upwards]  
Patrick: Is that a puppy I hear? I didn't know they had a puppy. What is it puppy? You wanna go out? [Mary's Mother frees her tongue out, a light bulb appears on top of her head]   
Mary's Mother: Oh. [barking]
Patrick: There you go puppy.
Mary's Mother: So long sucker! [maniacal laughing] Uh... [barking]  
Patrick: Huh, the puppy knows baby talk too... [Just then SpongeBob comes in from the stairs]
SpongeBob: Patrick! She's not a baby! [SpongeBob falls from down the stairs and hits Patrick and looks around while he's on Patrick's stomach.] Where's Baby Prunes? 
Patrick: I dunno, I just let the puppy out. 
SpongeBob: That was no puppy! [SpongeBob is jumping on Patrick's stomach] That was an old lady! An old lady that we're responsible for! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run outside to find Mary's Mother] 
SpongeBob: If you were an old lady where would you go?! 
Patrick: Ah, I don't know back in time?! 
SpongeBob: What about a sewing circle?
Patrick: Ah, yes a sewing circle back in time.
SpongeBob: Come on! [SpongeBob and Patrick go into a sewing circle with some old ladies] 
SpongeBob: Old lady Prunes? [The old ladies look at SpongeBob and Patrick in wonder] Have you seen a baby that's really an old lady? 
Bakery Cashier: Oh, look they have shmoods on their faces. [she spit on a napkin which then the other ladies follow]
SpongeBob: No, not that. [Patrick and SpongeBob are scared while the old ladies rub the napkin on their bodies]
SpongeBob: Ah, where's baby/old lady Prunes?
Patrick: No, no gross. [Patrick is disgusted while the old ladies rub them.]
French Narrator: Meanwhile... [cuts to a scene into a lava surf place.] 
Surfers: Yeah!
Mary's Mother: Yee-Haw! Lavabunga! [While Mary's Mother is having fun the other surfers on gone and loses the challenge, then she laughs maniacally then we cut to a scene where their parachuting]  
Skydiver: What are you doing you don't have a parachute?
Mary's Mother: Parachutes are for babies. [then she jumps and laughs maniacally while the skydiver is surprised] Oh yeah! [she falls into a haystack]
SpongeBob: Prunes!
Patrick: Old lady Prunes! 
SpongeBob: Old lady baby Prunes! [Mary's Mother is wrestling and throws and boxer on SpongeBob and Patrick] 
Mary's Mother: Well, if it isn't my two babysitters! you humiliated me!  
SpongeBob: Prunes, you're alive!
Patrick: And still talking baby talk! [They run to her and she mumbles angrily]
Mary's Mother: Why! [she then punches them in the face] 
SpongeBob: Ahh, Pruny wants to play nice old lady [then she repeatedly hits them until they become realistic]
Patrick: Ah, boxing tired her out. [then they fall out of the tree]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shh... 
SpongeBob: Ah, another job well done. [sniffs] Uh, Patrick, I think she needs to be changed.
Patrick: No, that's me. [The episode ends by them walking toward the sun set.]


Narrator: Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life. [chuckles] Well, you know. [Patrick is sleeping and the mailfish walks by and puts a box in his open mouth as he is yawning and waking up, he grabs it and quickly opens it, and it turns out to be a shiny, gold trophy]
Patrick: An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award. [antenna on top of rock breaks] Jellyfish, I got an award. [jellyfish zap him and he jumps up above the surface] Island, I got an awar... [chokes for air and floats back down] I gotta show SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [building a house of cards looking like Gary] Hold still, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Almost done. [Patrick smashes through the wall and cards fall on the floor; Gary flies away]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.[SpongeBob falls down to the floor]
SpongeBob: That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
Patrick: See for yourself.
SpongeBob: [his body is facedown, but his face come out and reads the award] "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?"
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
Patrick: But, it's shiny. [SpongeBob takes the trophy]
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
Patrick: Ice cream!
SpongeBob: Exactly!
Patrick: I can find it. Is it in here?
SpongeBob: No, don't! That's my... [Patrick opens the door and a bunch of awards pile out of SpongeBob's closet] ...award closet.
Patrick: I want an award! [starts to cry]
SpongeBob: [has two 1st place ribbons in his eyes] Aww, Patrick, don't cry. [Patrick starts sobbing loudly and wildly going away from the awards] You'll get an award one day.
Patrick: I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.
SpongeBob: But you're Patrick... [jumps on Patrick and his eyes turn into stars] Star. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.
Patrick: Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
SpongeBob: Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
Patrick: I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
SpongeBob: Smaller. [shrinks]
Patrick: Doctor?
SpongeBob: Smaller. [shrinks more]
Patrick: Fireman?
SpongeBob: [In a tiny voice] The smallest you can think of. [shrinks even more]
Patrick: A job at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Yeah! [grows to normal size] I do things at work all the time.
Patrick: Then let's go. [Patrick runs off, pulling off SpongeBob's arm]
Patrick: Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.
SpongeBob: And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?
Squidward: Guess who just quit? [puts his hat on Patrick's head and then leaves]
Patrick: Do I get my award yet?
SpongeBob: You have to work for it, remember?
Patrick: Tartar sauce. [SpongeBob flipping patties]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob places the order in the window] Pick up order! [Patrick comes and eats the order]
Patrick: Do I get my award, now?
SpongeBob: No, you have to take the tray to the customer.
Patrick: Ok. [tray gets to table but with no food; Patrick burps]
SpongeBob: Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table. [Patrick arrives with food on tray but then eats it as he sits down]
Patrick: Like that?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Patrick: [spits out food at the customer as he talks] Barnacles!
SpongeBob: Let's try something different.
SpongeBob: All you have to do is answer the phone.
Patrick: Aye aye, Captain! [phone rings]
Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: No, this is Patrick. [hangs up and starts whistling; phone rings again]
Girl on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: [annoyed] No, this is Patrick! [hangs up and continues to whistle; phone rings yet again]
Another Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: [angry] No! This is Patrick! [puts phone down and folds his arms] I'm not a Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
Patrick: Huh? Oh...Fishpaste!
SpongeBob: It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out? [hands Patrick a broom]
Patrick: What's the point? I can't do anything right.
SpongeBob: You'll do fine. [Patrick sweeps with the handle side of the broom instead of the head]
Nat: [approaches Patrick] Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown? [continues drinking]
SpongeBob: Keep trying, Patrick.
Delivery Guy: I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants. [Patrick becomes furious and sweeps harder]
Patrick: Why can't I do anything right?! [bangs the head of the broom on the floor making dust rise all over the Krusty Krab's dining area, which makes the nearby customers start coughing]
SpongeBob: [pushing Patrick] Kitchen!
Patrick: [throws the broom to the floor] I'm never gonna get an award, now.
SpongeBob: Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar. [gets a jar and opens the lid] Easy. Now you try. First get a jar. [Patrick gets out a pickle] Patrick, that's a pickle.
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: You need a jar. [Patrick picks up a spatula] No. [Patrick takes his pants off] No. [Patrick picks up SpongeBob] No. Try...this! [gives Patrick a jar] Now take the lid off the jar. [puts the lid in his mouth] Just relax. Lift your hand. [Patrick lifts his hand] Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid. [puts his hand on counter] No, the lid. [slides his hand to the corner of the counter] [Patrick tries for the lid over and over as SpongeBob keeps telling him "the lid", Patrick pants due to exhaustion; few seconds later, Patrick is almost there] Freeze! [hand is on the side of the jar] Almost there. Now head for the lid. [hand goes lower] Cold. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. [hand goes higher] Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!
SpongeBob: Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly as I do. [takes it off again] Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, you did it!
SpongeBob: That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.
Patrick: Yeah. Remember when I had my hand up? And I put it on the lid?
SpongeBob: That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [Patrick copies SpongeBob then SpongeBob stops] Huh?
SpongeBob: Well, back to the ol' grind.
Patrick: Well, back to the ol' grind.
SpongeBob: Forget my hat.
Patrick: Uh, me, too.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob mops the floor then puts the mop up; Patrick mops the floor but he makes the floor wet; SpongeBob comes out with a handful of plates and slips and breaks them all; Patrick follows in SpongeBob's footsteps; SpongeBob glares at him]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [at the grill, frying patties, both whistle a tune, then stop, they both wipe their foreheads] Whew! [SpongeBob drops his spatula]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Dropped my spatula. [bends down to pick it up]
Patrick: Uhh, me, too. [drops spatula and bends down to pick it up; SpongeBob takes off his hat, then Patrick takes off his, they both put their hats back on, then they both put their hands on the grill; Patrick's hand burns after a few seconds] Ow!
SpongeBob: Aha! [shows the fake hand] You're copying me!
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Why are you doing that?
Patrick: So I can win an award like you.
SpongeBob: Well, it's annoying, so stop it!
Patrick: Stop it. [both imitate the others facial expressions]
SpongeBob: Say, you're good.
Patrick: Thanks.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ha! Darn. [both look at each other with suspicion, while rubbing their chins] Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as...pickle fish lips! [both cover their mouths] Sea weavle. Gorgy smorgy.
SpongeBob: [in his head] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
Patrick: [in his head] At least I'm safe inside my mind.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [screaming]
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick run out of the Krusty Krab] Stop copying me!
Patrick: There's no award for that!
Squidward: [leaning against the Krusty Krab sign pole, reading a newspaper, a Krusty Krab hat falls near him] Well, I guess it's safe to go in now. [puts hat back on and walks back in]
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick are still running] Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?
Patrick: Until I have as many awards as you.
SpongeBob: We'll see about that!
Patrick: No, we won't.
SpongeBob: [takes out a jump-rope] I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: Me, too. [takes out a jump-rope]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice. [crosses arms and jump-ropes while Patrick tries to imitate but ties himself up with his rope] Ha! Not a scratch on me. [body breaks down into pieces]
Patrick: Oh, no, you don't! [squeezes the rope on himself breaking his body down into smaller pieces, then both hit a hammer on their heads]
SpongeBob: Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?
Patrick: Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you. [SpongeBob stops hammering his head but Patrick does not notice; Patrick hits himself faster and too hard, he stops and gets dizzy, trophies appear and spin around his head, and falls on the ground; SpongeBob runs into Patrick's rock painted as SpongeBob's house; SpongeBob gets angry and steam comes out of his head]
Patrick: My turn! [runs into the pineapple rock]
SpongeBob: [runs into his house] I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me. [pushes his nose into his face and comes out of his house dressed in Patrick's normal outfit] Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.
Patrick: What's so great about being a big pink loser? [SpongeBob's nose pops back out] Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick...
Patrick: Patrick's not here!
Delivery Guy: [stops in front of SpongeBob and Patrick in truck] Trophy delivery! [he drives off and SpongeBob has a package in his mouth]
SpongeBob: Another trophy?
Patrick: [sarcastically] Oh, great! [SpongeBob opens the package] What's it for THIS time?
SpongeBob: 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'. Patrick! This trophy's for you!
Patrick: Yay! [puts trophy on his head like a hat] Eee! [both rip off their present outfits to reveal their own normal outfits]
SpongeBob: So, what are you gonna do, now?
Patrick: I'm gonna go protect my title. [jumps on his rock and falls asleep, the rock closes]
Narrator: So you thought I was kidding, huh? No, in Bikini Bottom, excellence can be found, even under a rock.


SpongeBob: [snoring with Gary] [They both wake up because they hear a noise from outside and look through the window to find Patrick mopping his house.]
Patrick: ♪Makin' it clean, and livin' a dream. Makin' a scene, I'm makin' it clean, I'm makin' it clean. I'm makin' it clean!♪
SpongeBob: Hey, buddy, what are you cleaning for?
Patrick: ‘Cause I'm expecting some very important company.
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Patrick: My big sister, Sam!
SpongeBob: Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!
Patrick: [The music stops abruptly as Patrick drops the mop and starts to look sad.] Nobody does. [gets choked up] I lost her in the surf when we were kids.
SpongeBob: Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick.
Patrick: Sam took care of me when I was just nursing on coral. She was my...[sniffles] my...[sniffles] my... rock! [Patrick bursts into tears, sobbing in despair.]
SpongeBob: It's gonna be okay... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up, buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!
Patrick: Thanks, man, you're right. I can't wait to make up for our lost years!
Squidward: [opens window] Would you two pipe down!
Patrick: Sorry, I was getting my place ready for my sister.
Squidward: Well, I hope she's not as obnoxious as you. [Bus rides up]
Sam: [punches door open and walks towards Patrick thunderously]
Squidward: [closes window fast]
Patrick: ...Sam!
Sam: [Grabs Patrick by the neck and breathes in his face] Brubber!
Patrick: Sis!
Sam: [Starts hugging Patrick very tightly]
Patrick: It's so good to see you.
Sam: You. Sister Sam. Have much catch up to do. [accidentally catapults Patrick into his rock]
Patrick: Wow, you pack a wallop, sis. Sam, this is my best friend, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way. [Both giggling] Yeah long way, heh heh, go back.
Sam: [eyes bug out] Yellow square touch brubber! Make sister Sam mad! [chucks SpongeBob]
Patrick: I cleaned my rock just for you. [Both walk away]
SpongeBob: [Plummets and falls face-flat on the ground]
Patrick: Let’s go inside and play.
Sam: House too small. Make bigger. [pushes rock]
Patrick: Hey, great idea! I'll just go and get some tools and-
Sam: No.
Patrick: Huh?
Sam: I have tools right here. [takes out briefcase and pours out a bunch of sand. Starts making a sand rock]
Squidward: Oh, dear Neptune. Didn't you hear me- [face is pummeled with sand]
Sam: [Walks over sand rock and takes the tv antenna off of Patrick's rock. Puts antenna on sand rock]
Patrick: Thanks, sis!
Sam: Sister Sam loves to make rock for brubber.
Squidward: Well, make rock some where else. My house is full of sand.
Sam: If big nose no like sand, big nose move! [pushes Squidward's house away]
Squidward: This is way beyond my property line. Hey, Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister! [laughs] Construction humor.
Sam: [growls] No laughing!
SpongeBob: No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?
Squidward: Oh, I mean it, alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier.
Sam: [huffing]
SpongeBob: [scared] Oh, Squidward, you jokester.
Sam: [more huffing]
Squidward: Do you think she looks a little... miffed?
Sam: [huffing angrily, then starts crying] Those boys mean! They pick on sister Sam!
Patrick: Shame on you two! Look what you've done!
Squidward: Look what we've done?!
Sam: [crying so hard that her tears fling Squidward and SpongeBob]
Squidward: [falls face first in the sand]
SpongeBob: [flies onto a seahorse-shoe toss pole]
Tuck: Golly-doo-diddley, Clem, that was a nice toss.
Clem: Wasn't me, Tuck. My money's on the little missie over yonder.
Patrick: Awwww, hey, sis, don't listen to those... meanies. Hey, the new rock is looking kinda... boring. What do you say we decorate it?
Sam: Blecorate?
Patrick: You can call it whatever you like, sis, as long as we make it spiffy!
Squidward: [empties sand out of head]
Sam: Make new house spiffy. [takes window off of Squidward's house] Spiffy!
Squidward: Hey, you can't do that, that's my window!
Sam: [puts window on the antenna on the sand rock and laughs] Blecorate.
Patrick: That's the spirit, Sis.
Squidward: Oh no. That is definitely not the spirit, Patrick. Your sister is out of control!
Patrick: Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!
Squidward: You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it! [takes off the antennae-window]
Sam: [dismantles more part from Squidward's house and puts it on the sand rock] More spiffy!
Squidward: But that's from... [looks at his somewhat horribly dismantled house] My house! That's it! I've had my fill of this thieving brute!
Patrick: How dare you call my sister a thief, just because she took some of your things...
SpongeBob: Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?
Patrick: No I don't. Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit. I see now that you've turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well! [cries]
SpongeBob: It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-
Sam: Shush! Meanies make brubber's eyes water! [grabs SpongeBob and Squidward] Meanies go home! [Throws them to their homes]
Patrick: Come on, sis. They won't bother us under our rock.
Sam: Meanies is mean. [sand rock closes].
Squidward: [Walks out of his ruined house, gets angry and starts carrying a heavy rock]
SpongeBob: Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them.
Squidward: The time for talk is over! Now is the time for action! [walks onto sand rock and holds his rock menacingly over his head] A rock made of sand by two idiots is no match for one carved from the... [grunts] tides of time!
SpongeBob: I don't think you should do that.
Squidward: Who cares what you think?! If it's destruction they want, then it's destruction they'll get! [throws rock, but it bounces off and demolishes the pieces of Squidward’s house on the sand rock. Sand rock opens, flinging Squidward in the air]
Sam: Who makes noise? [sees the broken pieces. screams] Spiffy broken! [Squidward falls] Sister mad!
SpongeBob: Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy.
Sam: [picks up broken pieces] Sister Sam rearrange now!
SpongeBob: Please don't.
Sam: [chews up pieces and rapidly spits it out at Squidward's house. Squidward's house then collapses as Squidward looks at it in disbelief]
SpongeBob: Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward? [Squidward is gone] Huh? Must be getting started.
Squidward: [driving bulldozer toward the sand rock. Laughing maniacally]
Patrick and Sam: [shocked] Huh?!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, Squidward stop! [jumps on the bulldozer] Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?
Squidward: Oh, you mean like this? [revs up accelerator, knocking SpongeBob off] Sweeeet destruction!
Sam: [stops the bulldozer. drops Squidward out of the bulldozer and chucks it at SpongeBob's house, destroying it] That'll teach those meanies.  
Patrick: Your still my rock big, sis.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control.
Patrick: SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?!
SpongeBob: She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!
Patrick: Well, I guess she can get a little carried away.
Sam: What Patrick doing? Why Patrick talk to meanies?
Patrick: Well uh...well...well it's about your temper, Sam.
Sam: No have temper! That make sister Sam SO mad! Sister Sam put on mean face! [turns face around with an angrier face] Now smash brubber's house! [picks up the sand rock]
Patrick: Not the rock! [jumps on the sand rock while Sam pummels it]
Sam: [slams the ground and yells. Her regular face then sees Patrick hurt and unconscious] Patrick? Little Brubber? Little Brubber no wake.
SpongeBob: Patrick? [takes out cookie dough]
Patrick: [sniffs it and eats it as he wakes up] Cookie Dough!
Sam: Patrick Ok! Sister Sam feel bad. Sorry she hurt Patrick. Should protect little brubber. She go now. [walks away]
Patrick: Sis, wait! Hold on! Aw, don't feel sad. You don't have go!
Sam: Yes, Sister Sam must go. Late for manicure. [elephant trumpet] [hugs Patrick tightly again] Bye, brubber!
Patrick: Bye, sis.
Sam: [bus drives up and she punches another hole, but next to the door]
[The bus leaves.]
Patrick: Isn't my sister something?
SpongeBob: Aw, she's something, all right! [laughs]


[An envelope is pushed through SpongeBob's door.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary. [throws some popcorn into Gary's mouth] Hm, can't read the return address. [tears the envelope open] Maybe this will shed some light. [reads the paper. The note has the words in different fonts glued to the paper] Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin BlackJack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. BlackJack. [end of letter] Cousin BlackJack's out of prison?!
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: That's right, Gary, the cousin BlackJack! The same cousin BlackJack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids! [flashback to a younger SpongeBob with a bowtie and blue hat on. He gets his body thrown to a wall, courtesy of BlackJack's brutality]
Young BlackJack: [laughing] Come on, little man! Let's go a couple of rounds, if you think you're tough.
Young SpongeBob: Why should we?
Young BlackJack: Because it'll show what a little man you are. [spins SpongeBob around and plays with him as a jump rope. End of flashback. SpongeBob looks horrified from that experience]
SpongeBob: Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: My sentiments exactly. Just imagine what he must look like now! [imagines BlackJack as a giant]
BlackJack: Hi, SpongeBob. It's been a while. Good to see that you're still a little man. [laughs. Picks up SpongeBob and tears him in half then laughs some more]
SpongeBob: That brute has my parents! I got to get over there! [puts his clothes in a suitcase] Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone. I don't know if I'll ever come back.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents! [cries and wipes his eyes with a pair of underwear. Cuts to SpongeBob's parents' house where the building has been wrapped around with police tape and plastic] Oh, my gosh, what happened to my parents' house? What's this? "Do not cross"? Is that police tape? There's only one reason for the police being here: a crime has been committed! NO! Get it together, SquarePants! To face BlackJack, you've got to be as tough as nails! [forces himself inside the house] Huh? What?! All the furniture is covered in plastic! The police must have covered everything to preserve the crime scene. What could have happened here? [walks forward a little] What's this? BlackJack smashed my family portrait! Oh, no! What has he done with my parents?! [imagines his parents watching TV]
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, darling, it's so nice to spend quality time with you; what with you in the office all hours of the day. [Mr. SquarePants snorts. BlackJack busts down the door and laughs]
BlackJack: I got a new outfit for ya! [both parents are whimpering]
SpongeBob: That fiend! Where did he take them? I must find more evidence. What's this? Another note. [reads note] SpongeBob, I paid your parents a visit. Now, I'm going to do the same with Gramma! You better hurry, little man-boy. BlackJack. [end of note] He's going to get Grandma, too! I have to stop him! [cut to Grandma's house] Grandma, where are you? Are you okay? Grandma? You in here? Grandma? [sees a gingerbread man on a plate] Oh, no, I'm too late! He burnt you to a crisp! Oh, that animal! [cries]
Grandma: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Grandma? Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond?
Grandma: Well, if you mean from beyond the kitchen table, yes. You're just in time. I've baked a fresh batch of gingerbread men.
SpongeBob: But where's BlackJack?
Grandma: Oh, BlackJack just called and left a message for you. He couldn't make it because he's got some loose ends to tie up.
SpongeBob: Loose ends. My parents! He's tied them up?!
Grandma: And if you don't hurry, you'll miss out on all the fun. [SpongeBob imagines his parents being hung over a boiler by BlackJack. He screams as his head bends and an identical head pops up from his mouth] And when it's all done, he'll need help cleaning up the mess.
SpongeBob: Cleaning up the mess? [his face deflates] I got to get help! I'll go to Uncle Captain Blue's! He'll know what to do. [runs to Captain Blue's where he is mowing the yard. SpongeBob jumps on the lawn mower] Uncle Captain Blue, I need your help!
Uncle Captain Blue: Well, if it isn't little SpongeBob. Plant a firm one on me, Bobby. [shakes SpongeBob's hand, but tears his arm off in the process]
SpongeBob: I need you to help me rescue my parents!
Uncle Captain Blue: Sure, Little Bobby. I could use some help with the lawn, but you're gonna need this to do the job right. [hands back his arm. SpongeBob mows the lawn]
Narrator: 346 minutes later...
SpongeBob: Uncle Captain Blue, I need to help my parents! They're in danger!
Uncle Captain Blue: [turns off the mixer] What? You want to build a fence? [laughs] The boy came to work.
SpongeBob: Actually, I came to try to find my...
Uncle Captain Blue: [shoves wooden boards, hammers, and nails in SpongeBob's face] And when you're done, I've made a tomato and clam juice smoothie to refresh you. [drinks the smoothie out of the mixer] Ah. [SpongeBob builds a fence all the way around Uncle Captain Blue's property. over speaker] And how many candles you burning out there? Over. [indistinct speech and static] Do you copy? Over? [tries turning the knob] Copy? Do you copy?
SpongeBob: Uncle Captain Blue, Uncle Captain Blue! Please help me!
Uncle Captain Blue: Well, of course you can! [SpongeBob cuts off some coral, paints the house, and fixes the boat. When he's done, it's nighttime]
Narrator: Much, much, much later...
SpongeBob: [uses his tongue to crawl to Captain Blue] I AM DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR MY MOMMY AND DADDY!
Uncle Captain Blue: Landscaping? Isn't it a little dark out for landscaping? [SpongeBob grabs the music player and yanks it out of the wall]
SpongeBob: Listen, Uncle Captain Blue! We don't have much time. Cousin BlackJack has my parents held captive at his house!
Uncle Captain Blue: They let that dangerous miscreant out of prison? Sounds like your parents are in trouble, kid.
SpongeBob: That's why we have to rescue them now!
Uncle Captain Blue: Whoa, there, Little Bobby. No can do.
SpongeBob: But, Uncle Captain Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you!
Uncle Captain Blue: No, no, I don't chase criminals these days. I'm retired, and if I were you, I'd consider turning around and going home. You're not cut out for this kind of work, boy. An innocent kid like you doesn't stand a chance against a criminal mind. Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?
SpongeBob: You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set?
Uncle Captain Blue: Well, let's just say, I hope you've practiced walking without legs, or arms, or a body. But since you insist, I'll drive you all the way over to BlackJack's right now. [SpongeBob digs up the concrete with his fingers] Just try to relax until we get there. [drives 20 feet and stops] There it is. We're here. [SpongeBob gets out] Uh, lock the door behind you, kid. [SpongeBob pushes down the lock and Uncle Captain Blue drives back into his house. SpongeBob goes up the steps and then steps on a one that makes noise. A guard worm growls and barks at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Nice wormy, nice wormy. Nice wormy. [grabs the door handle to knock, but is tapped on the shoulder by his uncle in a thought cloud]
Uncle Captain Blue: Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you? [SpongeBob imagines himself knocking on the door and BlackJack grabbing him through the door and using him as dental floss. He screams]
SpongeBob: Uncle Captain Blue is right. I'm not cut out for this. I should just turn around and go home. [Margaret screams] Mother! [runs through the door] Mom?
Margaret: Help me!
SpongeBob: They're trapped in the basement! [runs down into the basement] Mom, dad, quick! Let's get out of here!
Margaret: Oh, but if we leave now, we'll miss the party.
SpongeBob: Party?
Margaret: Oh, why, yes. We're celebrating your cousin BlackJack's release from prison.
Harold: Now if your klutzy mother can stop dropping her punch glass like she dropped that picture frame...
Margaret: I told you, Harold, that was the fumigators' fault.
SpongeBob: The fumigators? So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house?
Harold: The only crime that ever happened at our house was the infestation of those worthless krill, but they should be gone by now.
SpongeBob: So, you two aren't being tortured by cousin BlackJack?
Harold: No, SpongeBob, your cousin BlackJack has paid his debt to society and renounced his criminal ways. Never again will he litter.
BlackJack: That's right, little man!
Margaret: Oh, well here comes the man of the hour. He's been talking all day about playing with his little cousin again. He mentioned something about jumping rope with like the old days. [SpongeBob's eyes break]
BlackJack: Did you come here to quiver like a jellyfish, or did you come to wrestle?
SpongeBob: [whimpering] To quiver! [hides his eyes, nose, and mouth inside his head]
BlackJack: I always knew you were a little man. Prepare to live your past in the present. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [whimpering] Come on, Little Bobby. Don't let him beat you. You've got to stand up for yourself this time! THAT'S IT! I am not gonna take this anymore! I am putting my foot down! You wanna tussle?! Well, let's tussle it up! [Cousin BlackJack runs at SpongeBob and hangs onto his leg. He is the size of SpongeBob's foot] Cousin BlackJack?
BlackJack: In the living flesh! [grunts as he takes off SpongeBob's shoe and punches his big toe]
SpongeBob: [laughs] That tickles!
BlackJack: Just like the old days, eh, cousin?
SpongeBob: Yeah, BlackJack, you haven't changed a bit. [everyone laughs]


[SpongeBob is riding on his horse, and muscular, and is saving a woman tied on the railroad tracks, screaming.]
Woman: Help!
SpongeBob: Hey, yah!
Woman: Help, help!
SpongeBob: Whoa! Hup. [horse stops] There, there. You're safe now, little lady. [maniacal laughter coming from a man]
Jack M. Crazyfish: You fool! You've falled into my trap. Now you're mine, SpongeBob the strong!
SpongeBob: So, we meet again, Crazyfish!
Jack M. Crazyfish: Bring it on!
SpongeBob: With pleasure! [cracks his knuckles]
Jack M. Crazyfish: [grunts] So loud!
SpongeBob: You ready to get crazy, huh, Crazyfish?!
Jack M. Crazyfish: You bet your frosting, Sponge-cake.
SpongeBob: Sorry, I'm not wearing any frosting. [both do a rock-paper-scissors game with SpongeBob winning the first round with paper over rock but Crazyfish changes his rock to scissors] Hey, that's cheating!
Jack M. Crazyfish: No, it's not.
SpongeBob: Yes, it is!
Jack M. Crazyfish: No, it's not.
SpongeBob: Yes, it is!
Jack M. Crazyfish: Is not!
SpongeBob: Is too!
Jack M. Crazyfish: Is not!
SpongeBob: Is too!
Jack M. Crazyfish: Is not!
SpongeBob: Is too! [while they argue, the train is getting closer to the woman]
Woman: Um, guys?
Jack M. Crazyfish: Anyway, your shoe's untied.
SpongeBob: Is not!
Jack M. Crazyfish: Is too.
Woman: Guys?
SpongeBob: Is not!
Jack M. Crazyfish: Is too.
Woman: The train!
SpongeBob: [jumps next to her] Don't worry! I'm ready! [tears his shirt off] Bring it on! [right before the train hits him, his alarm wakes him up from his dream] Oh, good morning, Gare-bear.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I kept you up all night with my nocturnal outbursts? Again?
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: No, no, Tuesday night was the one with the 30-foot librarian. Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch-villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature. [puffs out his chest. Goes to the bathroom and has trouble opening up the toothpaste. He deflates to his normal size and goes to get back into his bedroom and he opens a cabinet, rummaging through it, tossing away a sock, a wind-up eyeball toy, a baseball glove, one of his socks, a boot, and an 'I'M WITH STUPID' T-shirt. SpongeBob pulls out a red monkey wrench, and goes back to the bathroom and hits the wrench on the toothpaste, causing the top to ricochet off some things in the bathroom before hitting SpongeBob in the eye. He looks in the mirror to see if he has a black eye] Whew, what a relief. For a second there, I thought I gave myself a black... [He accidentally slips on the toothpaste top and hits his eye on the wrench] ...eye. [Looks in the mirror at his black eye. Starts crying in bed which startles Gary, he comes up to bed]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing!
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me.
Gary: [disagreeing] Meow.
SpongeBob: You promise you won't laugh? [Gary nods] Okay, here goes. [lifts his head off the bed] Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste. [Gary restraints from snickering] Thanks for not laughing, Gare. I knew you'd... [Gary leaves through his pet door] Gare...? [cut to SpongeBob leaving his house with pink sunglasses on. He looks around and sees no one around, so he walks out, but runs into Patrick]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob screams] Hey, cool glasses. Can I try them on... oh! [takes off the sunglasses and sees SpongeBob's black eye] SpongeBob, your eye. It's all black and swollen. How'd you mess your eye up, SpongeBob? Did someone hit you? Where is he? Yeah, we'll settle this like men. We'll sue him.
SpongeBob: No, no, it's okay, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson. [thinking of the toothpaste]
Patrick: Are you sure, SpongeBob? Who was this guy, anyway?
SpongeBob: Hmm... [thinking of Crazyfish] Jack M. Crazyfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall.
Patrick: [quivering] Oh.
SpongeBob: He was big and mean. Oh, but old SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners.
Patrick: What did you do?
SpongeBob: I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains.
Patrick: With tears?
SpongeBob: Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him.
Patrick: Then what happened?
SpongeBob: I woke up... Oh, I mean, I...
Patrick: I know exactly what you mean. You whooped him with your eyes closed!
SpongeBob: That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy. [walks off]
Patrick: There goes a real hero.
SpongeBob: [makes karate sounds] Slugger, that's me. [stops a sea cow crossing] What the? [Sandy is riding a sea horse and taming the sea cows]
Sandy: Yee-haw! Get along little fishies.
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy.
Sandy: Whoa! [sea horse stops] Hot cat snake in a barn. Look at your eye. Land sakes. That's quite a shiner you got there. Well, don't you worry none. I know some natural remedies that'll...
SpongeBob: Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need them. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.
Sandy: A fight? Well, there's no shame in losing.
SpongeBob: Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget.
Sandy: Why? Did he write it down?
SpongeBob: No, I engraved it on his pain gland.
Sandy: Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?
SpongeBob: Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!
Sandy: Jack M. Crazyfish?
SpongeBob: It all happened late last night... [flashback to last night where SpongeBob is walking down the road] I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head. [Crazyfish laughs after throwing the tire] Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps. [Crazyfish walks away crying] He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage.
Sandy: So how'd you get the black eye then?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner. [watch beeps]
Sandy: Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer.
SpongeBob: Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios! [cut to Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty! I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident. [SpongeBob kicks the doors open and looks around trying to look tough] Well, looks like I was right about the accident part. [SpongeBob walks up to a fish and shows the black eye he got]
Harold: Oh!
SpongeBob: Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking. [walks up to a table of two fish]
Sandals: Do you mind? We're trying to have a decent meal here.
SpongeBob: That's right. [SpongeBob walks up to Squidward. Clears his throat]
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm...
SpongeBob: Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just going to stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it. [takes the microphone] All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, gramma! [old lady puts down the mustard] Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.
Squidward: Not really.
SpongeBob: All right, who said that?! Was it you, gramma?
[Gramma shakes her head.]
Squidward: It was me, I said it. [SpongeBob turns around and hisses at Squidward, who recoils from the sight of the gruesome black eye]
SpongeBob: Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who. [flashback to this morning] It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum. [lady screams]
Harold: Hold it. Sponges don't have eardrums.
Mr. Krabs: He's right.
SpongeBob: Hey, let's save all the questions until the end! As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet. [lady continues to scream while tied to a railroad track] "Don't worry, I'll save you." I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes, I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me, but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak. [slow howl... thud] And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears. [he cries] The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face... [one of the tears bounces off a rock and hits SpongeBob in the eye] ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!
Dale: Uh, what did you say he looked like again?
SpongeBob: Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...
Dale: Little green hat?
SpongeBob: I kind of thought it was teal, but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat? [SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward gasp] He's... real...
Jack M. Crazyfish: I'm looking for SpongeBob Squ--
SpongeBob: Mr. Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive! I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.
Gramma: I liked the part where you told us where how he was crying like a baby. [SpongeBob runs home]
SpongeBob: Hi, Gary. [runs back with toothpaste and wrench] All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess... I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this... [hits the toothpaste with the wrench] Then I was walking, like this. [walks over to the toothpaste top] And I didn't see where the cap went, like this. [slips on the top and hits himself in the eye with the wrench] So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this. [points to his left eye] Uh... like these. [points to both eyes being black] So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?
Jack M. Crazyfish: Uh, not really. I'm here because I heard you make a really good Krabby Patty. [cut to SpongeBob bringing a plate with a Krabby Patty with six patties on it to Crazyfish]
SpongeBob: One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, my lord. Served directly to your waiting [slips and throws the patty into Crazyfish's face] Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry.
Jack M.Crazyfish: Where I'm from, sorry don't cut it. We settle things in a different kind of way. [play a game of rock-paper-scissors like before with SpongeBob holding out paper while Crazyfish holds out a rock, but changes it to scissors]
SpongeBob: No!

 
Narrator: "Boat Smarts with Mrs. Puff". This driving film is brought to you by: C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T. Citizens Of Bikini Bottom United To Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off The Road And Out Of Boats All Together.
Mrs. Puff: Good day, future motorists. I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts. [cut to Squidward in a pilot uniform]
Squidward: Ripping good day for a spot of driving.
Mrs. Puff: And a driver without boat smarts. [cut to SpongeBob sliding in on his head upside down, next to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet! [wiggles his legs. Squidward gets angry]
Mrs. Puff: Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure. [cut to Squidward putting air in his tires] Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level. [cut to SpongeBob pumping too much air in his tires] While this driver pays no need to boat smarts. [tires flips the boat over. Then the tire explodes and blows air into Squidward's face.] Buckling Up. [cut to Squidward putting on safety belt] As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty as a result of a collision. [drives off but stops slowly at a stop light] Notice how he comes gently to a stop sign. [cut to SpongeBob driving his boat through town destructively without wearing his seat belt and laughing] Now this driver, with no regard for safety. [Squidward screams as SpongeBob slams into the backend of Squidward's boat, sending him flying into the air still in his seat and buckled up with the steering wheel in his hand. Squidward screams more as he sees a spiky steamroller driving on the road he is flying into. He tries to get his seat belt off but squeezes through the spikes anyways] Well, at least he had his seat belt on. [The boat, now cut in half, comes out of the steamroller and in it is Squidward, all injured. His seatbelt pops off.] Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now? [Squidward is adjusting his mirrors] You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater. [Beeping sound is heard. SpongeBob is running over citizens while he is adjusting his mirrors]
SpongeBob: Ah, perfect. [moves from behind Squidward in the road and drives in front of him]
Squidward: Hey, use your mirrors, fool!
SpongeBob: Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet. [adjusts it to where the light in the reflection blinds Squidward]
Squidward: Ah! Can't see! D'oh! [puts on sunglasses and giggles. Screams as he crashes into a brick wall. Footage from live-action Japanese Crash test dummy is showing with Squidward's head replacing the Japanese dummy's head. He slides out of his seat] Ow.
Mrs. Puff: Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road. [Squidward's eyes turn into a lock but vision the road as well. Cut to SpongeBob eating a Krabby Patty and reading the newspaper while driving] And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety. [SpongeBob is shaving himself while driving the wrong way on a one way street. Tom is shaking his fist, Sadie looks at SpongeBob and Fred shaking his fist in the air. He causes a woman to crash into a streetlight pole]
Norma: [screams] Jerk!
SpongeBob: Hi there!
Nat: Help! Lunatic driver! [crashes his boat into SpongeBob's but SpongeBob's boat is unharmed and keeps driving.]
SpongeBob: How's it going? [He causes many drivers to flip their boats over and get in accidents]
Fish: [all screaming and talking at once] I can't feel my hair. My leg!
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law. [SpongeBob's boat slips in some water and spins around and around]
SpongeBob: Lalalalalalalalala! Whee! [his boat is driving backwards now] Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff. [Squidward and Mrs. Puff scream. SpongeBob's boat stops on a rock and tilts upward, causing Squidward's boat to fly up into the air then into the pile of boat mobiles that are in the accident. Mrs. Puff blows up to a big puffer fish]
SpongeBob: Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts! [laughs and drives off, making dust and the low quality video recorder stops]
Mrs. Puff: Never mind.


[Episode starts at SpongeBob's house, and SpongeBob is brushing Gary's shell]
SpongeBob: 97, 98, 99, 100. Okay, Gary, let's do the other side now. Gary, can you hear that? [Gary is confused, then SpongeBob walks outside, and over to Squidward] Oh Squidward, it's you. I thought I heard something.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing?
SpongeBob: Breathing.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace.
SpongeBob: [Half of his head flips open while he talks] Okay! [Squidward takes out his wallet]
Squidward: Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here.
SpongeBob: I have it, Squidward, you gave it to me to leave you alone yesterday. [Squidward gets up] Squidward, you can have the $5 back. Mr. Krabs says--
Squidward: I don't care what Mr. Krabs says! I just want-- [bangs on the table, and the liquid in his cup spills on him]
SpongeBob: Coffee rain!
Squidward: It's hot chocolate. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Chocolate rain! [Squidward is still walking] Squidward! [Squidward runs screaming] Squidward, wait! [scene then shows both of them running for a while, then Squidward gets to his boat. Tries to open it but can't.]
Squidward: It's locked!
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! [Squidward screams, then jumps in the boat, then tries to start it but it won't start]
Squidward: Huh?[realizes the key isn't there] The key! Oh, where did I put that stupid...
SpongeBob: [as he is yelling, Squidward is searching] Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, why can't I just find?[SpongeBob makes it to the boat]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: What?!
SpongeBob: You left your keys on the table back there. [Squidward starts the boat] Hey, Squidward?
Squidward: Yes?
SpongeBob: Didn't you used to have one of those cucumber bicycles?
Squidward: Oh, [laughs] that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it.
SpongeBob: Why?
Squidward: So I could get further away from you! [rushes off]
SpongeBob: Okay, I'll see you later then, Squidward.
Squidward: Bon voyage, nincompoop! [Squidward accidentally runs through a stop sign, literally. He then realizes he is being chased by cops] What the? [pulls over, then the policeman walks up] Can I help you, officer?
Policeman: No, but you can help yourself to this ticket.
Squidward: [gasps] Ticket? Officer, please! I have inpeckable boat smarts! I pried myself in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have!
Policeman: Well, you can have it again, right after you complete boating school. [drives off]
Squidward: Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo? [cuts to Mrs. Puff's boating school] Boating school. [knocks on door] Oh well, it's just one day out of your life Squiddy. How bad can it be? [SpongeBob opens the door]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! [Squidward cries, then the bell rings]
Mrs. Puff: Good morning class. Would everyone please take a seat? [SpongeBob sits]
SpongeBob: Psst, Squidward, sit here. Here.
Squidward: Um, excuse me, there doesn't seem to be any empty seats left.
Mrs. Puff: But there's one right next to SpongeBob. [Squidward sits there, and SpongeBob touches him]
Squidward: Do you mind?
SpongeBob: Don't worry Squidward, we're boating buddies now! I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can.
Squidward: We won't be doing anything, because there is no we! Understand?
Mrs. Puff: Quiet in the front please.
SpongeBob: Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, boating buddy.
Mrs. Puff: Okay class, how about we get to know our new students, by telling each other why we were sentenced to I mean why we are enrolled in boating school.
Student: Um, I got caught speeding.
Mrs. Puff: Very good. Next.
Student: I don't see what's so very good about it.
Mrs. Puff: No, I didn't mean very.
Student: [sighs] I know exactly what you meant.
Mrs. Puff: Next.
SpongeBob: Oh, I am here because I.
Mrs. Puff: We all know why you're here, SpongeBob. What about you, sir? [referring to Squidward]
Squidward: Me?
Mrs. Puff: Yes. Would you like to tell the rest of the class, why you're with us today?
Squidward: Why I'm. [sees SpongeBob staring, and breathing at him] All right, I'll tell you. I was trying to get away, from him! He is the bane, of my existence!
Mrs. Puff: Yours too? Uhh. What I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard, and draw a diagram of the incident.
Squidward: Gladly. [begins drawing what he is saying] It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here. [referring to Squidward's house] Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in [screeches the chalk board] evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?
Mrs. Puff: Why, certainly. And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up, and illustrate his side of the story.
Squidward: His side?
SpongeBob: Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then [continues writing, without speaking] and then I went around, and stopped right here. [We See The Bubbly Transition]
Everyone: SpongeBob and Squidward, best boating buddies, forever. [all are confused, then SpongeBob sits down]
SpongeBob: Do you like it Squidward?
Squidward: Shut it. [bell rings, then cuts to everyone eating lunch, and SpongeBob sits next to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy? [SpongeBob sits, and Squidward walks away, over to the trash cans]
Squidward: I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school. [Squidward is about to eat, then SpongeBob pops up from a trash can]
SpongeBob: Squidward, do you have any mustard in there? [Squidward runs away screaming, then cuts to the bathroom, where Squidward is eating]
Squidward: Mmm, Bon appétit, Squiddy. [is about to eat, but then sees SpongeBob's feet in the other stall. Squidward gets angry, and throws his sandwich on the ground] You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my... [door opens, revealing that it's a muscular tough fish, with feet that look like SpongeBob's. Scene cuts to Squidward walking to his seat, bandaged up]
Mrs. Puff: Okay class, it's time for our behind the wheel lesson. Squidward, you'll be riding with SpongeBob.
Squidward: Eh, didn't see that coming. [cuts to them in a boat]
Mrs. Puff:  Now, we're going to take this nice and slow. SpongeBob, what do we do when pulling away from the curb?
SpongeBob: Uh, step on the gas?
Mrs. Puff: Good. Nice and easy. Now let's slowly... [SpongeBob steps on the pedal, and Mrs. Puff screams]
Squidward: SpongeBob, look out! [they bump through the cones, then they barge out through the fence, then they go through a red light] SpongeBob, give me that wheel!
SpongeBob: I got it, I got it. [they fight over it]
Squidward: Just let go of it! [the steering wheel breaks, and Mrs. Puff screams. They drive into grandma]
Grandma: Hooligans! [they drive through the Barg 'n Mart, and a costume shop, and they are about to drive into a secret lab]
Scientest 1: Johnson, I finally figured out a way to shrink an ordinary mail man, down to the size of a grain of sand.
Scientist 2: How?
Scientist 1: By using this shrink ray. [he pulls a lever that turns it on, then the boat comes in, and they get shrunk instead]
Scientist 2: Mother of mercy! [they shrink] Where'd they go?
Scientist 1: There! They're heading right for that discarded potato chip. [mail man growls]
Scientist 2: What's the matter?
Scientist 1: Potato chips are his favorite snack. [he breaks out] Johnson! No! [is about to eat it, but then gets sprayed with water]
Scientist 2: No, no, no. [they then go through a drain. A cowboy is about to drink from a drinking fountain, but then Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob come out and return to normal size]
Cowboy: I never will understand these city folk.
SpongeBob: Hey, where'd Squidward go? [the tough fish from earlier is going to go to the bathroom again, and Squidward returns to normal in the toilet]
Squidward: I was just leaving. [cuts to Squidward walking toward his desk all bandaged up]
Mrs. Puff: Okay class, it's time to take our final exam. Please have your pencils ready.
SpongeBob: Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and-
Squidward: [furious] How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!
SpongeBob: [sadly] Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it.
Squidward: Thank you. [tries to pick up his pencil, then picks it up in both hands, but then it drops and rolls out the room]
Mrs. Puff: 3 more minutes class.
Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help.
Mrs. Puff: 2 more minutes.
Squidward: SpongeBob, please? This is important.
SpongeBob: You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me.
Squidward: No no, I didn't. I never said that. [Student plays back what Squidward said] I don't need your help, and I don't need you! [now talking] Jerk! [student shrugs] All right, I said it. But that was before.
SpongeBob: Before what?
Squidward: Before before.
Mrs. Puff: 1 more minute, class.
Squidward: Before we were, [gulps] boating buddies.
SpongeBob: Yay!
Mrs. Puff: Okay class, time’s up.
Squidward: Time can't be up. I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer. What am I supposed to do?
Mrs. Puff: You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test, you take it again next week.
Squidward: Next week?
SpongeBob: Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test. [screen cuts to outside] But we'll meet again next week, at Mrs. Puff's boating school! [Squidward screams]


[SpongeBob's foghorn alarm goes off]
SpongeBob: This is it, Gary!
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed bounces up and flings SpongeBob onto the calendar, where he lands on March 3rd with the words "boating exam today!" on it then drops to the floor]
SpongeBob: The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable! [A door opens from underneath him. He comes out of his house riding a unicycle] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Squidward! [SpongeBob rides his unicycle around Squidward's house]
Squidward: Ready to move?
SpongeBob: No, I'm ready to pass my boating test. [Rides his unicycle towards the school] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [stops his unicycle near a dumpster and jumps off of it] I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore. [throws the unicycle into the dumpster] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!
Gus: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license!
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Hey, I'm getting mine next.
Gus: Hey, I doubt it. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [jumps around the boardwalk]
Mrs. Puff: [sighs] I'm not ready. [opens the door]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!
Mrs. Puff: [with clipboard and pen in hand] We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must...
SpongeBob: First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
Mrs. Puff: I know. Okay, #1: What is the front of the boat?
SpongeBob: The bow. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: What is the back?
SpongeBob: Stern. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: #3: Right is...
SpongeBob: Starboard. [answers the remaining questions] Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924! [Mrs. Puff writes down his answers]
Mrs. Puff: You've passed the oral test. What a surprise! [gets in the boat and secures herself tightly] Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat.
SpongeBob: Oh, in this boat right here? [looks at his watch] Is it time already?
Mrs. Puff: Get in the boat, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, absolutely. [gets in and closes eyes with a smile]
Mrs. Puff: All you have to do is get on the track.
[SpongeBob's eyes spring open in awe; he looks ahead to the track that gets longer and longer in delusion]
Mrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Mrs. Puff: No, no. First thing is to... start the boat. [Mrs. Puff turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat.
SpongeBob: The boat?
Mrs. Puff: Okay, now what do you do next?
SpongeBob: Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: Yes... no, no! Don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Floor it?!
Mrs. Puff: No, no, don't, don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Okay, floor it!!!
Mrs. Puff: No! No! [SpongeBob pushes the accelerator down and starts driving backwards really fast by some spectators and drives into a lighthouse] NO! NO!!!
SpongeBob: Floor it! [After crashing, Mrs. Puff inflates and becomes big and round with a deep voice]
Mrs. Puff: OOHHH, SpongeBob, WHYYYYY?
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: [in his bed at night] I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, thirty-eight. [puts his pillow on his head]
Gary: [puts on SpongeBob's boots] Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, I'm not walking.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie in SpongeBob's bed] SpongeBob, this is star ranger, over.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] What is it, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] I got a surprise for you.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Get out of bed. [SpongeBob gets out of bed]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, now what, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Go to your closet for a surprise. [SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, I'm at the closet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] I don't know, Patrick. [SpongeBob opens the closet door and Patrick has one of SpongeBob's SquarePants on]
Patrick: Patrick SquarePants!
SpongeBob: [deadpan] Pat, don't do that. [sits in a chair] I've got too much to worry about.
Patrick: What's the problem?
SpongeBob: I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: ...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers... [Patrick's square pants rip off] ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
Patrick: Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. [takes SpongeBob's walkie-talkie]
SpongeBob: How are we going to do that? [Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob's head with the antenna coming out of the top]
Patrick: Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. [SpongeBob notices the antenna sticking out] Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? [Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. Next, we see a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob's upstairs window]
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge. Testing, testing. [looking through the telescope at SpongeBob] Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing. Testing! [loudly] TESTING!!! [screams] TEST, TEST, DO YOU READ?!
SpongeBob: Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Got your apple ready? [SpongeBob shows an apple] Lucky undergarments? Hold on... hold on... [Patrick focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word lucky on the top of it] BINGO!!! Underwear, apple, and me! You're ready to get that license! Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff. Act natural. [SpongeBob jumps out of the boat and on the ground and starts chewing grass]
SpongeBob: Mooooooooo.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, get in the boat! [SpongeBob jumps in the boat. A siren is heard as Mrs. Puff comes out an ambulance and into the boat] Give her the apple. [SpongeBob gives her the apple]
SpongeBob: Here you go, ma'am. [Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows]
Mrs. Puff: Let's get this over with. [takes a deep breath] What's the first thing you do? [puts hands and arms over head for protection]
SpongeBob: Uhh...
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Start the boat. [SpongeBob pushes a button that starts the boat causing Mrs. Puff to go crazy]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Whoa-ho! Huh? What?
SpongeBob: It's okay, it's only the boat.
Mrs. Puff: The boat? You started the boat?
SpongeBob: I... I think so.
Mrs. Puff: Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, put it in drive.
SpongeBob: Put it in drive?
Mrs. Puff: Yes, yes, yes! [SpongeBob pushes lever down to drive] Put it in drive! Then what?
SpongeBob: [lifts leg up] Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: NO! AHH, NO!!!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] FREEZE, MISTER. [SpongeBob stops] BIG. TOE. [SpongeBob's big toe pops out of his shoe and gently pushes the accelerator down]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, gracious. Oh, gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, you're coming to your first turn. [giant wall with the word wall on it is shown and a left curve]
Mrs. Puff: Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Left! [SpongeBob turns left]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Right! [SpongeBob turns right]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Oh my, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine.
Montage: [SpongeBob stops at a stop sign and looks both ways before starting to drive again. Then drives around with his left arm out making a signal. Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of SquarePants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob's diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating out of SpongeBob's fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down.]
Mrs. Puff: Splendid! Wonderful! [sign that reads finish line is just ahead] There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head? [everyone laughs] Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? [everyone laughs] And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? [everyone laughs] Oh, yes, but that would be cheating. [SpongeBob opens his eyes wide realizing he is cheating]
Patrick: HAHA! CHEATING!!! [hysterically] HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!
SpongeBob: I'M CHEATING! Mrs Puff?!
Mrs. Puff: Yes, my star pupil?
SpongeBob: I think I'm cheating...
Mrs. Puff: What's that, dear? [SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff]
SpongeBob: I think I am cheating!
Mrs. Puff: You've... you've let go of the wheel.
SpongeBob: I do have an antenna under my hat! [shows antennae under hat] There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true! [crying] I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
Patrick: WHAT!?! [Patrick runs out of SpongeBob's house and back under his rock, crying]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!
Mrs. Puff: [packing] The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel...
SpongeBob: Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
Mrs. Puff: No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat that way!
SpongeBob: No... I'm cheating...!
Mrs. Puff: At least, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: I'm cheating!
Mrs. Puff: Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!
Mrs. Puff: It's okay to cheat today!
SpongeBob: No...!
Mrs. Puff: That way! Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: Cheater...! [crashes off screen into the lighthouse again, Mrs. Puff inflates again]
Mrs. Puff: [manly voice] OOHHH, SpongeBob, WHYYYYY?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: It's okay, SpongeBob, you didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. [EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester. [Mrs. Puff cries as she is taken away by the ambulance] It'll be great! [walks away] Only now I don't even have my bike.
Gary: [with SpongeBob's bike] Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile! [rides away on his bike with Gary on his head] Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!


Squidward: [Evening at the Krusty Krab. He switches the 'open' sign to 'closed.' Appears very optimistic.] Closing time. The happiest time of the day! [scene cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen crying and sniffling]
SpongeBob: Closing time. [sniffles] The saddest time of the day! [falls on the ground still crying] Huh? [he notices an old Patty under the grill] It's a Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob tries to pick it up but it's stuck to some gum] Eww... It's cold and hard. [takes the Patty out from under the grill] This could have rolled under there years ago. [pats it on the head] There, there, little one, your journey is almost over. [SpongeBob tosses the Patty in the trash. A siren goes off as a fishing line retrieves the patty]
Mr. Krabs: [runs in] What happened? [gasps then runs up to the trash can] Someone tried to throw away a patty! [takes it off the hook]
Pinch-o-matic: Pinch-o-matic has saved you 5.2 cents.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill.
Mr. Krabs: And tomorrow, a customer will find it under his bun. [hands it to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.
Mr. Krabs: You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?
Narrator: The next day...
SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward. [puts the tray with the old Patty on the window]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Hooray. [smells the Patty then flips the top bun off. Flies buzz around the stinking patty.] Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.
Squidward: Whatever. [he hands the tray to Gus] Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty. [Gus sniffs it. He screams with disgust and quickly back-flips his way out of the restaurant. Scene cuts to the Krusty crew standing by the door.]
Mr. Krabs: I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?
Squidward: What? [splutters in frustration at Krabs' stupidity] Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.
Mr. Krabs: Gone bad? That's nonsense! Bring it here, SpongeBob. [picks up the cage with the Patty inside it] Uh, why is it in a cage?
SpongeBob: Because it growled at me. [Patty is now sentient and starts to growl and bark like some sort of dog. Squidward hides behind Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are. [takes the Patty out of its cage but it still barks and growls in Mr. Krabs' face] No... no... [the Patty barks and growls some more] Stay... [throws a 'treat' into its mouth] Thatta girl! There, there. [He pats it gently] See? Good enough to eat. [about to eat it when an ambulance goes by] Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then... [Takes a bite. Scene cuts to him moaning, now green in color due to food poisoning, being rolled on a hospital bed] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet! [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs in a hospital bed]
Purple Doctorfish: Well, Mr. Krabs, you gave us quite the scare.
Mr. Krabs: So I'm gonna be okay, doc?
Purple Doctorfish: Well, if you don't want to take my word for it, let's just check your chart. [looks at the chart] Let's see here. Hmmm... oh, no! [starts to shake] Oh no, this is terrible! [drops the clipboard]
Mr. Krabs: Everything okay, doc?
Purple Doctorfish: Don't touch me! [runs out screaming]
Mr. Krabs: That's not a good sign. [thunder roars as the room turns into green. The Flying Dutchman appears. Mr. Krabs pulls his covers over his head, showing he's scared.]
Flying Dutchman: Har, har har har har har har har har har!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!
Flying Dutchman: Eugene Krabs, your time has come.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh... [looks at the flower vase next to him] Flower!
Flying Dutchman: Oh, sorry. I must have the wrong room. [flies out] Excuse me, nurse?
Nurse: [in a happy, musical tone] Yes?
Flying Dutchman: I'm looking for Eugene Krabs.
Nurse: Oh, he's in that room right there.
Flying Dutchman: No, that's Harold Flower's room.
Nurse: [confused] Harold Flower? [Flying Dutchman goes back to Mr. Krabs in anger]
Flying Dutchman: So, Krabs, you thought you could fool the Flying Dutchman?
Mr. Krabs: What do you want from me?
Flying Dutchman: I'm here to escort you to the resting place of all bad undersea folk: Davy Jones' locker!
Mr. Krabs: Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!
Flying Dutchman: Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing. Next stop, Davy Jones' locker! [Evil laughs. Scene cuts to Davey Jones' locker where Flying Dutchman and Mr. Krabs reappear] Here we are.
Mr. Krabs: [smells something nasty] Blec! Why does it smell so foul?
Flying Dutchman: Davy Jones works out a lot. [opens the locker where a bunch of smelly gym socks are] These are his socks. Get in!
Mr. Krabs: [gets on his knees and starts crying] Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!
Flying Dutchman: Come on, Krabs, show a little dignity.
Mr. Krabs: [Frantically] Mommy!
Flying Dutchman: Alright, alright, stop your crying. I'll give you another chance, but you must always be generous, never cheap.
Mr. Krabs: You have me word as a sailor. [scene cuts to the dilapidated Krusty Krab where a sign hangs over it that says 'Out of Business']
Squidward: [looking through Mr. Krabs desk drawers] Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these. [SpongeBob is wearing his hat and holding his spatula, crying]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings. [sniffs] He won't like it!
Squidward: SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back. [Wears a stethoscope. Tries to open the safe, putting a stethoscope onto the safe to avoid suspicion.] Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe. [Mr. Krabs walks in]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boys! [SpongeBob screams with joy as Squidward sheepishly hides his stethoscope behind his back]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive! [clings to Mr. Krabs happily] Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?
Squidward: [Deadpan] Well, it was.
Mr. Krabs: You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money, [mimics being infatuated to money] touching money... [returns back to normal talking] Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs. [scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where a giant 'Grand Re-Opening' sign is hanging. 'Buy' and 'Free' signs are in the window] Welcome all, welcome! [a little kid walks up to Krabs] Hello, little one. What you got there?
Monroe: A Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?
Monroe: I don't go hungry?
Mr. Krabs: No, silly! It means free toy! [gives him a little toy]
Monroe: Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad.
Mr. Krabs: I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills! [everyone cheers. Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob] Hello, boy! Say, where's Squidward?
SpongeBob: Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'. [scene cuts to Squidward sleeping peacefully in a bed in Mr. Krabs' office]
Mr. Krabs: [Joyfully] Great!
Martha: Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes sir. [takes the patty and lifts the top bun where a disclaimer, written in ketchup form, is shown] Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [puts down the bun] That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir. [goes into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Sorry about the confusion. [pulls out a toy] Free toy? [Martha takes it, looking confused]
Squidward: Eugene, my man.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! How's the break coming?
Squidward: Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you? [Winks then walks off]
Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy. [walks up to a customer watching a movie on a small television hanging from the ceiling] Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?
Harold: This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!
Mr. Krabs: [pats the customer on the back] No expense spared for my valued customers. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob standing in front of the restaurant] Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.
Squidward: [walks in with some envelopes] Here's your mail, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.
Squidward: Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me. [stretches and yawns a little]
Mr. Krabs: Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is. [opens the envelope] Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad. [runs up to the cash register] I'll just subtract it from today's profit. [opens the register, but it's empty] And...there's no money in here. [laughs] How delightful.
SpongeBob: Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Me, too. How are we gonna get paid? [both walk up to Mr. Krabs] Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon. [SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other surprised]
Squidward: Uh... "dream"?
Mr. Krabs: Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!
SpongeBob: Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.
Squidward: Here's the bill. [hands Mr. Krabs the bill from earlier]
Mr. Krabs: You mean... I'm awake? [he screams as his head cracks through the middle over and over. Each time he cracks his head open, a new one appears. He races up to Nat drinking a Mountain Dew-like drink and he confiscates it from him] No more refills! [takes it to the soda machine and the drink gets sucked back into it like a vacuum. Then he runs up to two kids playing with toys. He steals them also.] Give me back them toys, you freeloaders! [He then runs back over to Harold watching the movie earlier] Show's over, cheapskate! [turns the TV off then presses a button that erases his memory of the movie. Harold goes dizzy.]
Nathiel Waters: Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny! [reaches for the penny]
Mr. Krabs: [grabs a hold of the customer's arm] Your luck just ran out!
Nathiel Waters: Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm.
Mr. Krabs: Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off. [Flying Dutchman reappears. The customer runs away]
Flying Dutchman: A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... For eternity!
Mr. Krabs: I'm not cheap, I'm generous!
Squidward: You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.
Mr. Krabs: [sarcastically] Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you. [Flying Dutchman picks him up] Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.
SpongeBob: Wait just a burger-flipping second!
[Flying Dutchman turns around]
Flying Dutchman: Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?
SpongeBob: That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea. [Mr. Krabs is happy at SpongeBob's words]
Flying Dutchman: He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.
SpongeBob: I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.
Flying Dutchman: You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?
Mr. Krabs: That depends, how much money we talking about?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Flying Dutchman: [shows money] 62 cents.
Mr. Krabs: I'll take the money.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Flying Dutchman: Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents. [hands him the change and picks up SpongeBob] Next stop: Davy Jones' locker! [SpongeBob screams as they both disappear]
Mr. Krabs: [Runs to Squidward, happy] Look, Squidward, money!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?
Mr. Krabs: You think I could've gotten more?
Squidward: He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!
Mr. Krabs: [Briefly looks at his change in a sad way until he starts to cry.] Oh, what have I done? [cries] I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money! [throws the change on the ground] I want SpongeBob back! [Flying Dutchman reappears and drops SpongeBob on the floor]
Flying Dutchman: Here, take him back.
Mr. Krabs: You heard what I said about the money?
Flying Dutchman: Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Flying Dutchman at Davy Jones' locker with SpongeBob talking a lot] And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!
SpongeBob: [In the Davy Jones' locker scene, talking simultaneously with the Flying Dutchman's explanations, talking super quickly] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!
Flying Dutchman: He's your problem now. [laughs evilly as he disappears]
Mr. Krabs: Heh, about trading you for pocket change...
SpongeBob: Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.
Mr. Krabs: You would have?
SpongeBob: No. [all laugh. Scene cuts to the Flying Dutchman sitting on a chair, reading a book until the phone rings]
Flying Dutchman: [picks up phone] Dutchman's residence.
SpongeBob: [on the other end, talking super quickly] So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work. [Flying Dutchman groans] I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.


[The beginning opens up to bikers riding by coral, setting them on fire as they ride by.]
SpongeBob: [at Jellyfish Fields] La la la la la. [attempts to catch a jellyfish] Missed ya. Uh-oh. [notices road] You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over. [motorcycles approaching. As they do, SpongeBob hangs onto ones jacket] The "Ild Ones"! That's a strange name. [jacket tears] Scallop! [rolls in the cement] Bye "Ild Ones." I like your silly name. Hmm..."w." Oh, oh, they're not the "Ild Ones." They must be the "Wild Ones."
Fish: [dressed in farmer outfit with a pick-ax in his hand pops up] The Wild Ones?! Tar nation! Don't you know who the Wild Ones are, son?!
SpongeBob: No; I don't know who you are, either.
Fish: Why, they're the most ferocious, bloodthirsty biker gang under the sea. They've destroyed entire cities in an afternoon! [laughs maniacally and then jumps back into the hole he was digging]
SpongeBob: Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut! [as the next scene of bubbles comes up, so does SpongeBob. Bubble pops inside of the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?
SpongeBob: There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!
Mr. Krabs: Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?
SpongeBob: Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!
Mr. Krabs: What are you going on about? Bikers?
SpongeBob: The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous horde of hooligans in the sea.
Mr. Krabs: Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it? [cuts to later where a sign hangs that reads 'WELCOME WILD ONES!'] Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, this is serious! [cries and runs out]
Mr. Krabs: That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course. [cuts to The Wild Ones 25 miles from Bikini Bottom. Cuts once again to SpongeBob in front of Squidward's house.]
SpongeBob: Squidward! [knocks on door]
Squidward: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: A horrible biker gang called the "Wild Ones" are coming. We've got to run, hide! [crying]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, my. This sounds serious. Luckily, I know just what you should do. Listen closely.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Squidward: Get a good grip on your pants. [SpongeBob does so] Turn around. [SpongeBob does so]
SpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?
Squidward: That's it. [kicks SpongeBob into the air. Cuts to SpongeBob landing next to Patrick, who is sniffing under his arm]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, an evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: [turns his back and crosses his arms] Huh.
SpongeBob: Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?
Patrick: Oh, I heard you. But what didn't hear was a hello.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Hello, Patrick.
Patrick: Hello, SpongeBob. [realizes] Bloodthirsty bikers! Ah! We got to hide! [both run and scream then run into each other. Both run and scream again and keep hitting each other until they run through Jellyfish Fields. Patrick and SpongeBob hide in a giant clam until it spits them out. The giant clam uses mouthwash after that]
Giant Clam #2: Hey, what happened to you?
Giant Clam #1: [groaning] I... I don't want to talk about it, man. [SpongeBob and Patrick fly through kelp grass. As they hide in it, a mower comes by and mows them over, then uses a leaf blower to blow them into a pile. Both reform into their shapes and scream more]
Patrick: [jumps behind SpongeBob] Hide me!
SpongeBob: [jumps behind Patrick] No, hide me!
Patrick: [jumps behind SpongeBob] Hide me!
SpongeBob: [jumps behind Patrick] Me!
Patrick: [jumps behind SpongeBob] No, me!
SpongeBob: [jumps behind Patrick] Me!
Patrick: [jumps behind SpongeBob] Me!
SpongeBob: [jumps behind Patrick] Me!
Patrick: No! No more running.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats [holds his pants] and their leather pants. [points to head]
SpongeBob: [holds up a black sock] Their leather socks.
Patrick: If we dressed up like that, then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.
SpongeBob: Say that again, Patrick.
Patrick: Little baby doody-heads?
SpongeBob: No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers. [Scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick putting on biker clothes. SpongeBob and Patrick put on biker pants, SpongeBob stretches his barefeet toes out to put on his biking boots, Patrick puts on a bike jacket, and then they put on biking helmets] What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough?
Patrick: I wouldn't mess with ya.
SpongeBob: Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride. [cuts to later where Patrick and SpongeBob are revving their engines in the streets of Bikini Bottom. Zooms out to show they are riding bicycles] Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here.
Harold: Ooh, I feel protected now.
Scooter: Those are some mean looking rides, dudes. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's working. They think we're... vicious bikers. [cuts to Krusty Krab where they both enter inside] Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here.
Patrick: [drools] See?
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's your salivation.
Patrick: Oh.
SpongeBob: So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?
Squidward: Does that part include laughing at you? ‘Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.
SpongeBob: Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?
Patrick: I'm bloodthirsty. See? [shows a cup with the word 'BLOOD' on it. He takes a sip] Want some?
SpongeBob: Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood. [both take sips of their drinks] See, Squidward? We walk the walk, but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?
Squidward: No, I don't.
Patrick: What about our biker club?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: How about our biker organization?
Squidward: No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, your outfits, or your fellowships.
SpongeBob: What about our coalition?
Patrick: Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.
SpongeBob: [takes out clipboard] We'll just pencil you down as undecided. [Squidward groans and walks away] Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone.
Mr. Krabs: This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.
SpongeBob: Then can we save the town?
Squidward: Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?
SpongeBob: Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react? [flashback shown] Squidward! We're out of napkins! [screams] Out of napkins! [another flashback to SpongeBob banging on Squidward's door] Squidward! I accidentally removed the "Do Not Remove by Penalty of Law" tag on my mattress! Hide me! Hide me! [another flashback] Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind! [Squidward turns on lights] Oh. Thanks, Squidward. [back to present]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. It's one of your many annoying traits.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Me? Annoying? [annoying laughter. Squidward growls] Yeah, right.
Squidward: You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way. [motorcycles approaching] What was that?
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there, mateys. Motorized vehicles headed over the horizon.
Squidward: What? [grabs binoculars] Gimme that. [sees them coming. His eyes pop through the binoculars as he screams] Don't just stand there, save us!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as we do it together. [Patrick is already running away] Patrick? Patrick! [Patrick is headed into Jellyfish Fields and to the bus stop where a bus picks him up and takes him to a plane. Patrick jumps out of the plane and onto a rocket ship] Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we...
Squidward: Panic! Run for your lives! [customers gasp] The Wild Ones are coming! [everyone screams and runs]
Lenny: The Wild Ones? [jumps into a sardine box] Mable, get the kids! [Mable jumps into the sardine box with Susie and Tyler and then closes it]
Charlie: Honey, I got the napkins. Oh, what have I missed this time?
Squidward: [running out of the Krusty Krab] Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket. [shows a shirt with a skull on it] I want to ride to live and live to ride. [screams as the bikers ride in a circle around him] I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.
Biker #1: What's that, missy?
Biker #2: What?
Biker #1: Howdy, we're the "Mild Ones".
SpongeBob: Mild Ones? [turns the W upside down] Oh!
Biker #1: Gimme back my M. Let's go, boys.
Mr. Krabs: Don't you want to spend any money?
Biker #1: Don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants? Let's ride. [bikers ride off]
SpongeBob: Goodbye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?
Squidward: Woo-hoo-hoo! [riding with the biker gang] Ride to live and live to ride!


[At the Krusty Krab, Squidward is at the ordering boat and SpongeBob is looking out from the ordering window. Mr. Krabs' voice sounds on the P.A.]
Mr. Krabs: Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention! [Mr. Krabs is standing next to them, speaking into a megaphone] Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office! [pause] That will be all. [Squidward and SpongeBob follow Mr. Krabs into his office and sit down] I have an important announcement to make.
SpongeBob: Woo! Hooray! [SpongeBob jumps up on top of the chair and twirls it around] The new spatulas are here!
Mr. Krabs:  Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulers!
Squidward: [sarcastically] How disappointing.
Mr. Krabs: You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast. [he looks at a picture of Pearl and Mr. Krabs in swim attire jumping up from the water] It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh... [puts the picture back on the wall] Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers! [a bell rings]
Pearl: [off-screen] Hello? Daddy?
Mr. Krabs: Thar she blows! [Mr. Krabs leaves the room]
Squidward: SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?
SpongeBob: No new spatulas?
Squidward: No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?
SpongeBob: Right! [SpongeBob and Squidward shake hands]
Squidward: So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions.
SpongeBob: Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs' head pokes into the office] All right, men. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk out of the office] Say hello to me Pearl.
SpongeBob: Hello, pole. [SpongeBob hugs one of the giant pillars]
Pearl: [holding a box] Hi, guys.
Mr. Krabs: It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!
Pearl: Great, dad, because I have so many new ideas.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs sniffs the air and his eyes conjoin to make a dollar sign shape] I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me! [walks off]
SpongeBob: What's in the box?
Pearl: It's a surprise.
SpongeBob: I like surprises.
Pearl: Great, then close your eyes.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob covers his eyes with his hands] I'm ready! [Pearl puts the box's open end over SpongeBob]
Squidward: Well, I like it so far.
Pearl: [Pearl lifts up the box] Ta-da... [Squidward gasps. The body suit is pink with purple flowers and on the top are two K's being held up by springs.] It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself. [Pearl hands SpongeBob a mirror]
Squidward: Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform.
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. [he winks to him] Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!
Squidward: Fish paste.
Pearl: Oh, SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu! [giggles]
Squidward: Well, I didn't think it was possible, SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual.
Pearl: Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you, too. [she holds up his uniform]
Squidward: Don't bother! Only a fool would wear that!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office, wearing the uniform] Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers? [laughs, then shuts the door. Krabs peeks his head out] Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for.
Squidward: [with the uniform on. The two springs give and the K's fall over Squidward's eyes] Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.
Pearl: Squidward is such a barnacle.
SpongeBob: A stick in the sand.
Pearl: But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style.
SpongeBob: Me? Really?
Pearl: Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me.
SpongeBob: Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here. [he looks at a picture he drew of Mr. Krabs, himself and Squidward with mustaches]
Pearl: Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess, [cut to a view of the Krusty Krab as a deserted place, where a skeleton is sitting at a table] we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise.
Pearl: [cut to Pearl with a notepad, thinking] SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?
Squidward: [Squidward runs over] For what, dare I ask?
Pearl: The new name for our new look. I mean, "The Krusty Krab" has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh! [she points the pencil towards her open mouth, to show disgust]
Squidward: Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?
Pearl: Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab? [puckers up lips and makes kissing noises]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is now in royal attire] The King Krab?
Pearl: [Pearl holds up a lollipop, which bears an odd resemblance to her father] The Kandy Krab!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob dressed as a jazzy beatnik] The Kool Krab. [dresses as a cowboy riding a stick horse] Or the Kowboy Krab! [appears totally stretched out] The Kurly Krab. [appears as a mad scientist holding a brain with Mr. Krabs-like arms coming from it] The Kreepy Krab. [Appears as a crazy killer jungle man with a loincloth. Shouts scarily.] The Killer Krab!
Pearl: [freaked out] Aaah! No!
SpongeBob: You're right, too scary. [they both think and finally get the name]
SpongeBob and Pearl: The Kuddly Krab! [Both happily hug and laugh. A rainbow of colors fills the screen. Pearl, SpongeBob and an anguished Squidward stand outside the new restaurant. The sign for the restaurant is now a heart and a cutesy robot Krabs is waving his arms atop it. The restaurant outside itself is tie-dyed with colors and rainbows and the flags are now hearts. Balloons are hanging from the roof and giant lollipops come from the chimney. Pearl and SpongeBob, giggling, walk back in the restaurant. Squidward is so mad that the two K's on his uniform catch on fire and he shakes the pole. Millie and Fred drive by in a car.]
Millie: It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab.
Fred: That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?
Squidward: That's it! I quit! [he rips off his uniform, revealing nothing under it. A police whistle is blown and a cop comes over. He writes him a ticket and places it between his legs. Inside the restaurant, it's a total makeover, like Pearl said before, it's a teenage paradise.]
Shelia: Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out! [Pearl and SpongeBob admire their restaurant]
SpongeBob: Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl.
Pearl: Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision. [blinks bashfully]
SpongeBob: Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill. [SpongeBob is in the kitchen at the grill] The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter. [he pushes his spatula on the grill and imitates a sizzle]
Pearl: [Pearl is in the ordering window to hand SpongeBob an order] SpongeBob, order up!
SpongeBob: Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a [pronounces it wrong] sa-lad? [cut to SpongeBob walking up to Pearl with a tray with two Krabby Patties] Here you go. Two sa-lads.
Pearl: Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.
SpongeBob: But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.
Pearl: Exactly.
SpongeBob: All right. [walks back to the kitchen and sadly removes the top bun] Okay, no buns. That's hip. [removes the bottom buns and top buns] No patties, [removes the patties] happenin.' [crushed] Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.
Nazz: This is so cool!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob walks over with a tray of salads to Nazz and Nancy at a table, who are talking] Two salads. [he drops the tray on the table and walks back to the kitchen] That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it. [he screams, noticing the grill is gone] Where's the grill?
Pearl: Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!
SpongeBob: Uh... right on.
Pearl: Check out this new menu I came up with. [SpongeBob takes the menu]
SpongeBob: [reading it] Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?
Pearl: Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore. [takes the spatula from SpongeBob. He starts to stutter] I've got something more fun for you to do anyway. [cut to SpongeBob outside the restaurant in a crab suit, waving at cars. One car with Gus stops]
Gus: Hey, buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention! [laughs and drives off]
SpongeBob: This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much! [he walks toward the restaurant, but gravity gets the best of him and he falls over. He struggles to get up and starts to whimper. Cut to SpongeBob at Mr. Krabs' door, outside the costume.] Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on... [he knocks on the door and peeks in] Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you? [Mr. Krabs' office is just as elaborately decorated as the rest of the restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: Come on in, me boy! Have a seat.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [he sits down in a bear bean bag chair, but starts to sink inside it]
Mr. Krabs: Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob has sunk in, now you can only see his eye] Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem.
Mr. Krabs: Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob has totally sunk into the chair and he sticks out his hand] Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news.
Mr. Krabs: How about my cuddly executive buddy? [picks up a blue stress-relief doll] Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95. [Krabs squeezes it and its eyes, nose and ears pop out]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob pops out of the chair] Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab! [he covers his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab. [goes over to a picture of a seahorse] What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers? [goes to a strand of lights] How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?! [holds one up] It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money! [starts to cry] Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?
SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way.
Mr. Krabs: That's it, boy!
SpongeBob: What's it?
Mr. Krabs: You could fire her! It's okay if she hates you.
SpongeBob: That's not what I said, sir. [Mr. Krabs brings SpongeBob to the door]
Mr. Krabs: Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office. [SpongeBob is pushed out the door and accidentally runs into Pearl]
Pearl: Totally rude, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?
Pearl: Sure, SpongeBob. [they walk to the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [thinking] How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes. [SpongeBob opens his mouth to say it, but Pearl is already crying]
Pearl: [crying] Oh, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob lets out a sigh of some relief]
Pearl: I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!
SpongeBob: Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!
Pearl: No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob thinks for a second] I got it! I can pretend to [air quotes] "fire you." I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.
Pearl: [Pearl grabs SpongeBob in a bone-snapping hug] Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!
SpongeBob: [muffled] Stop trying to break me in half?
Pearl: [Pearl drops him] Deal. [cut to SpongeBob and Pearl walking up to Mr. Krabs' door, Pearl tries to conceal her laughing] Oh, boy!
SpongeBob: Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing. [loud and clear] Pearl, I need to have a word with you! [we see Mr. Krabs in his office, sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen.
SpongeBob: It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that...
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs is pushed against the door] Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way? [he sees himself in the uniform in the mirror] It's for the best.
SpongeBob: Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if...
Mr. Krabs: I can't let him do this! [he goes for the door, then sees the vault open. It's empty, and a spider crawls around its web] Get on with it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Pearl, you're fired. [Mr. Krabs chokes and falls over]
Pearl: Thanks, SpongeBob. [kisses him. She runs off and jumps into a car with all her friends] Come on, gang, the mall awaits! [they drive off. SpongeBob runs into the office]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it! [he screams when he sees Mr. Krabs' body. He runs over to a bill behind glass, which is for emergency purposes and he breaks the glass. He waves the bill under Mr. Krabs' nose.]
Mr. Krabs: [regaining consciousness] Oh, Pearly... [sniffs] Is that a $20? [he pockets the bill] Oh, SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood? [cries]
SpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy.
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: She's off to bigger and better things.
Mr. Krabs: That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man! [laughs] But how am I gonna get my money back for all this stuff? [SpongeBob thinks. Cut to his house, where all the stuff is put up in his house. SpongeBob dances in his uniform to the music]
SpongeBob: [laughing] Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!
Gary: [Gary is covered in stuffed animals and his shell has flowers painted on it] Meow?


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward are cleaning Mr. Krabs' office.]
SpongeBob: [being used as a scrub brush to clean the window] Ooh—[gasps] Ooh—[gasps] Yeah! Don't you just love cleaning day?
Squidward: [wrings SpongeBob in the mop bucket] We're so lucky.
SpongeBob: Aww. Mr. Krabs' first dollar. [sprays the picture frame, pulls his face off and scrubs it clean before putting it back on; however, the dollar is reduced to two quarters] Whaa? [he sprays the picture frame again and scrubs it clean with his head; this time, it reduced into a penny] Huh? [he sprays the picture frame again and scrubs it clean with his back; this time, the picture frame is completely blank; SpongeBob takes out a dollar, licks it and pastes it onto the picture frame]
Mr. Krabs: Don't forget to clean the safe, boys. And keep your eyes on the Krabby Patty secret formula! [leaves]
Squidward: Hey, we need the combination!
SpongeBob: I got it covered. [turns the lock, goes to open it, but breaks his arm]
Squidward: Nyah!
SpongeBob: [hums as he pulls a piece of rolled-up paper from his broken arm] Doink! [snaps his arm back in place and chuckles as he reads the paper before turning the lock] Mm. Mm-hmm. [opens the safe] Voilà!
Squidward: [garbage falls out from the safe] Ahh—ooh! [pops out from the garbage]
SpongeBob: See? This is fun!
[Meanwhile, outside the Krusty Krab, Plankton is once again devising his latest scheme to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.]
Plankton: [laughs and holds out a strange helmet] Krabs will never see me coming! Presso-inviso! [pushes the button on the helmet and his body turns invisible; he hums as he walks to the restaurant, but trips over] Ahh! Can't see my own feet.
[Back in the restaurant, SpongeBob is taking care of the secret formula like he's caring an infant.]
SpongeBob: [wraps a diaper around the bottle] Mm-hmm. [hums as puts the formula on a blanket and gives it a teddy bear and a baby bottle; then he wraps it with the blanket]Don't you go anywhere while I clean your homey-womey.
[As SpongeBob dusts the safe, Squidward dumps trash in the trashcan with the secret formula still inside. He then goes to dump it out through the window.]
Squidward: Out of sight...[Plankton laughs as he goes to the window] Out of my mind. [dumps the garbage on Plankton]
Plankton: [pops out from the garbage] Hey, watch it! [he sees the formula next to him and blubbers in surprise] Hommina—wah? The secret formula! Must be one of Krabs' tricks! [grabs the formula and makes a run for it] He'll pop out any second now. [stops in front of the Chum Bucket] Well? [silence] Nothing. All right. [turns around and heads back in the Chum Bucket] I really did it! [goes to the kitchen where Karen is mixing chum with the grinder] Hey, Karen, guess what?! I finally got the Krabby Patty secret formula! How do you like me now?
Karen: [scans the bottle until her screen says, "Secret Formula equals Genuine"] It's genuine. Come here, you big hunk of aquatic organism! Ooh, I knew you could do it![hugs Plankton and kisses him] Just don't blow it this time. 
[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is finishing up cleaning the office. He notices the Krabby Patty formula is gone from the trashcan.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Oh! Ahh! [looks all over the office] Hey, Squidward, have you seen the Krabby Patty secret formula? [lifts the desk and drops it] Ohh! [pulls out from underneath] I put it right here in this circular file cabinet.
Squidward: That's a trash can, you nitwit! [SpongeBob looks at the item closer while Squidward sits back but suddenly gets scared] The formula?! [cuts to them looking for the formula outside] Face it, SpongeBob! [gets trash thrown in his face] The formula—
SpongeBob: Don't say it!
Squidward: Is gone.
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Oh, I asked you not to say it! [unscrews his eyeballs and cries a fountain of tears] Why would you ever do that?
Squidward: [comforts SpongeBob] Come on. [throws him in through the window; cuts to them back in the office] Now let's see if the security cameras picked anything up. [pushes the button under Mr. Krabs' desk and a keyboard comes out] Hmm. [types on the keyboard and turns on the television while SpongeBob gasps in amazement]
Patrick: [on screen as he opens a trash can] Hi! I like to order—hmm—half a Krabby Patty, please! [digs in the trash can and pulls out a half-eaten Krabby Patty] Oh, thank you. [laughs then eats it]
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward types on the keyboard to go to another footage. The footage shows Bubble Bass reading a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book while eating a Krabby Patty. Squidwardr pans out the footage, only to show that Bubble Bass is doing all this on the toilet in the bathroom. SpongeBob and Squidward both exclaim and groan in disgust. Squidward types on the keyboard and goes to the next footage. The footage shows the Krabby Patty formula outside the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Ah! It's alive!
Squidward: Hold on. [types the keyboard and zooms in on the footage to reveal Plankton holding the formula] Plankton?!
SpongeBob: Ahh! [his face falls off his body and falls over; he gasps] What are we gonna do?
Squidward: [grabs SpongeBob and breathes in and out of him like he's a paper bag.] Okay. All right. We'll just pretend everything's normal until closing time. Then we'll steal the formula back from Plankton! Yeah!
[Back at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is struggling to remove the cork from the bottle in hopes of reading the formula.]
Plankton: Come on! Open up! [tries to open it with his teeth but fails] Ahh! [tries to saw it open and stomp on it, but they also fail; posing as a genie from "Spin the Bottle"] Open Sesame? [tries to burn it with a flamethrower, but it also fails as he ends up getting burned himself; he tries to blow it up with explosives, but it also fails as they blew up part of the Chum Bucket] It's no use, Karen. It won't budge.
Karen: Of course not, Einstein, it has a time lock. [points to time lock on the cork] It won't open until tomorrow morning.
Plankton: Well, I've waited this long. [opens the safe and puts the formula in it] What's a few more [closes the safe and talks loudly] excruciatingly long [calmly] hours? [turns the lock]
[It is now nighttime at the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs is locking the doors.]
SpongeBob: [nervously] Night, Mr. Krabs. Sleep tight.
Squidward: [nervously] Don't let the bed urchins bite.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, sure. You, too, you two. [climbs in his boat and drives away home while SpongeBob and Squidward laugh nervously as they wave good-bye]
Squidward: Okay, let's go get that formula.
SpongeBob: Ooh, we are gonna pull [imitates Plankton] a Plankton on Plankton! [laughs]
[SpongeBob and Squidward sneak behind the Chum Bucket. Squidward goes to the front doors, but a meow sound startles him.]
Squidward: Nyah! Whaa?
SpongeBob: [appears in a cat costume] Sorry. [laughs] Stepped on my tail.
Squidward: What are you wearing?
SpongeBob: I'm a cat burglar! [purrs and meows around Squidward and stops] Okay, I'll change. [rips off his cat costume]
[SpongeBob and Squidward go to the front doors. Squidward attempts to push them open, but it is locked.]
SpongeBob: Hang on. [slips in underneath] Ooh.
Squidward: And just how am I supposed to get in? [SpongeBob grabs him by the legs and pulls him in underneath, accidentally ripping his eyes out] Ooh! [grumbles as he grabs his eyes and puts them back on his face]
[SpongeBob peaks through the sewer lid and sees nothing around. He pops out and slides behind the Chum Bucket's menu. He slithers down from the wall, leaving two dents on his body. He and Squidward hide under a table. Squidward bashes SpongeBob on the head to straighten himself out. Plankton is seen watching a scary old movie.]
TV Monster: [growls]
TV Actress: Ahh!
Plankton: [slurps on soda and eats some popcorn] Yeah, yeah, now eat her brain! [sighs] I love a good romance. [turns off the TV and yawns]
[Plankton hops off his chair while SpongeBob and Squidward hide under the table. Plankton scratches himself and goes into the bathroom. SpongeBob and Squidward follow him. Plankton flosses his teeth with his antenna. His machine brushes his teeth and pours mouth wash in Plankton's mouth. Plankton gargles the mouth wash and swooshes it up in his mouth. His machine places a hair curler on his antennas. He spits the mouth wash in a cup the machine is holding for him. Plankton dips his eyeball in the mouth wash, causing it to burn. The machine sprays eye drops in his eyeball to make it feel better. SpongeBob and Squidward made it to the bathroom where they almost got caught as Plankton exits through the small door. Plankton goes to the elevator and goes up.]
SpongeBob and Squidward: Phew.
Plankton: [exits the elevator] Good night, honey. [blow kisses to Karen]
[Karen snores as she sleeps in her bed. Plankton hops onto his bed, claps his hands to turn off the lights and goes to sleep. SpongeBob sneaks into the bedroom through the doorknob. He slithers past Karen and goes to check on Plankton.]
Squidward: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Making sure he's asleep.
[SpongeBob opens Plankton's eyelid and sees his eyeball snoring. SpongeBob gives Squidward a thumbs up, letting him know that Plankton is sound asleep. Squidward groans. The screen cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward tiptoeing all over the laboratory as they search for the formula. SpongeBob's pants and torso walk off, leaving SpongeBob's head and arms in tact in midair. SpongeBob hears a growling noise.]
SpongeBob: Yeesh! [runs over to Squidward as he torso and upper body reattach themselves] Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Squidward scream as a monstrous shadow roars at them. They run around in panic until something pounces onto Squidward. It was Plankton's pet amoeba, Spot.]
SpongeBob: Aww, it's Plankton's little pet, Spot. He wants to play!
Squidward: [Spot is licking him all over] Will you get him off of me?! [tries to shake Spot off his legs]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Ahh! [grabs a fuel rod, which zaps his body as his skeleton is shown, and whistles] Get the stick, boy! [Spot sees the fuel rod and barks happily] Fetch! [throws the fuel rod and Spot goes after it through the front doors; SpongeBob then locks the doors shut]
Squidward: Look out!
[A sleepy Karen rolls in behind SpongeBob.]
Karen: Diodes...zebras...Make a new batch of chum...[snores]
SpongeBob: It's okay. She's in sleep mode.
Karen: Oh, dear, the chum is escaping. [grabs SpongeBob and Squidward, stuffs them in the chum grinder and grinds them both into chum; she snores as she rolls away]
[SpongeBob and Squidward, now grinded up into a pile of chum, slithers away. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Squidward hiding in empty toxic waste cans and rolling themselves over to the safe where Plankton is keeping the formula. They pop out of the cans and walk over to the safe.]
Squidward: This must be it.
[SpongeBob pushes the buttons on the doors. The alarm goes off and an electric eye looks down on them.]
Electric eye: Remain still for retina scan.
Squidward: Now what'll we do?
SpongeBob: Good thing I brought this! [pulls out a criminal picture of Plankton] They really captured the cute little dimple on his chin.
Squidward: Looks like they captured the rest of him too!
[The electric eye scans the picture and approved it. The electric eye closes itself up and opens the doors. The safe is at the far end.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
Squidward: I'll take it from here. [pushes SpongeBob aside]
SpongeBob: I'm fine.
[Squidward goes for the safe, but he steps on a tile, setting off a trap. A giant boot squishes Squidward flat.]
Squidward: You go first this time.
SpongeBob: Hmm-mmph. [goes for the safe, but steps on a tile setting off another trap]
[A hammer slams onto Squidward.]
SpongeBob: You okay? [steps on another tile, setting off another trap]
Squidward: No! [gets incinerated by fire underneath him]
[SpongeBob moves over to a different tile, but sets off another trap. A pair of robot arms gives Squidward a wedgie. SpongeBob runs around in panic, stepping on more tiles and setting off more traps. A bowling ball crushes Squidward's foot.]
Squidward: Ow. [gets slapped in the face by a robotic arm]
SpongeBob: [stands on a tile and doesn't move as it sinks down into the floor] I'm standing still! I'm not even doing anything!
[Squidward gets electrocuted by the electrical bolts. Then he gets crushed by a piano followed by a spiked-ball and a boat that resembles Titanic. Squidward is now reduced to liquid and slithers over to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Heh...sorry. [gathers Squidward up and puts him in a bucket.]
[SpongeBob walks over to the safe and revives Squidward back into his normal form. He turns the lock on the safe.]
SpongeBob: Ahh. [the safe opens to reveal the secret formula; he laughs] I can't believe that actually worked! [touches the bottle and the alarm goes off]
[The tile below SpongeBob and Squidward sends them flying into a rocket. The rocket closes and blasts out from the Chum Bucket with a screaming SpongeBob and Squidward inside. The rocket crash lands in the back of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward roll out from the rocket and are completely singed and injured. It is now dawn and Mr. Krabs drives up to the front doors. He goes to unlock the doors and sees SpongeBob and Squidward.]
Mr. Krabs: Good morning, Krusty crew! Ready to cook up a new batch of Krabby Patties? Er...[sees SpongeBob and Squidward singed and injured] Why are you two smoldering?
SpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: [covers SpongeBob's mouth] No, he's delirious! He doesn't know what he's saying.
SpongeBob: [pushes Squidward away] No! Mr. Krabs deserves the truth. We accidentally threw away the Krabby Patty formula and Plankton found it! We tried to steal it back, but we failed! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: [gets really angry and smoke steams out of his eyestalks] You did what!?!?!? Plankton stole me formula?!
Squidward: [he and SpongeBob nod their heads] That's what he said. Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: [calmly] Then I'll just have to steal it back. [walks over to the Chum Bucket] Hmm. Uh-huh. [punches a hole through the wall and grabs the secret formula from inside] Oh. [kisses the bottle] Don't worry. Papa's here.
[The scene changes the scallop making its rooster call to Bikini Bottom. Plankton, now awake, goes to the safe.]
Plankton: Oh, yeah! [looks at himself with his pocket mirror] Who's the man? You are! Eh, man.
[Plankton throws the mirror away. He turns the lock on the safe. He opens it and reveals Spot with the fuel rod barking happily at him. The hole behind Spot was the same hole Mr. Krabs made when he retrieved the formula. Spot jumps onto Plankton with the fuel rod and licks him while in doing so, zapping his body and showing his skeleton.]
Plankton: No, no, no! Krabs!
[Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I'm sure glad the formula is back in the safe where it belongs, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Me, too, boy-o. And to make sure you two don't ever take your eyes off it again, I have a surprise for you. [SpongeBob and Squidward are stuffed in the safe] You're me new security system. [closes the safe and laughs before he leaves]
SpongeBob: Yay!
Squidward: Wait! I'm claustrophobic!


[The episode begins at another day at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is happily flipping patties and humming to himself. Suddenly, Mr. Krabs and a man in a suit comes in the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Spatula down, sailor!
SpongeBob: [drops his spatula] What's going on, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: According to the nice man from the Labor Authority, it's time for your break, boy-o.
SpongeBob: [confused] We get breaks?
Labor authority officer: [very angry] Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles nervously] Well, of course you do, boy-o. Why, if I don't give you a five-minute break once every 20 years, this lovely man could fine me big bucks. [guides SpongeBob out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Nice meeting you.
Mr. Krabs: [sits SpongeBob on a table] And you don't want me to get fined, do you?
SpongeBob: [gasps] No! Never.
Mr. Krabs: Good! Then you just sit here and don't do or say nothing for five minutes [sees the labor authority officer in front of him] Oh—and enjoy your break. [laughs and walks off as the labor authority officer follows]
[SpongeBob sits quietly for a little while. He whistles to himself to pass the time. SpongeBob looks at the table and gasps when he sees a spot on it. He opens his face, grabs a cleaning spray and a rag and attempts to clean it.]
Mr. Krabs: [appears below the table] SpongeBob! What are you doing?!
SpongeBob: Uh, I just spotted a spot.
Mr. Krabs: You can't work on your break, boy-o! Period! Remember the fines?
Labor authority officer: [overhears it and gets real angry] I knew it! I've had my eye on you for years, Krabs! Oh, this violation is really gonna cost you! [looks through his list of fines given for the Krusty Krab] Hmm...
Mr. Krabs: [yelps] Oh, I can see we're gonna have to take drastic measures here.
[Mr. Krabs rushes to the wall and smashes through it between the kitchen and the restrooms. He takes a mallet and breaks down the wall, revealing the employee break room.]
SpongeBob: [reads the sign on the door] "Employee break room?" I never knew this was here!
[Mr. Krabs opens the door and turns on the light. It shows that the employee break room has not been used in years. It is covered in dust and cobwebs. Poison sea urchins crawl out from the room. SpongeBob looks around and see just how filthy the room is. But despite all that, he doesn't seem to mind it at all.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, it's beautiful! Like stepping through a portal into the magical realm beyond!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, whatever. Five minutes! [closes the door]
SpongeBob: I just hope there's enough time to enjoy everything. [opens an old refrigerator and sees old hot dogs in there] Ooh!
[SpongeBob takes the hot dogs and sticks them together with toothpicks to form a sausage carousel. He puts it in a microwave to heat up and watches it spin around.]
SpongeBob: Ooh. [laughs] Enjoy your carousel, my little hot dog friends. [laughs as he skips away]
[The hot dogs get so hot that they melt and burn in the microwave. Then they explode inside.]
SpongeBob: [pretending to surf as he rides on a chair in front of a wave poster] Surf's up! [falls over] Wipe out.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob taking out containers of old, moldy food. He opens one and the bad odor is let out. SpongeBob takes some moldy food, sniffs it and eats it.]
SpongeBob: I think this used to be...creamed corn!
[One moldy food comes to life.]
Blobby: Sorry, bub. Ha! I was meatloaf before I expired. [laughs and gives SpongeBob a high-five]
SpongeBob: Oh, Globby, you're so silly. [laughs until he starts to feel sick as his body slowly turns green and crumbles to the floor]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob making a band out of cleaning products.]
SpongeBob: Voilà! My break room band. Scrubby and the Cleaning Crew. Hmm... [looks at the control panel on one of his creations] Let's see if I wired everything right. [the panel sparkles; looks at the microwave and it sparkled too] Perfect. [uses the microwave as an electric guitar] Yeah!
[SpongeBob pumps up the music and uses steel wool as a disco ball. Meanwhile, the customers hear SpongeBob's music playing through the break room door.]
Gale Rechid: Huh? [hears music through the door] Ooh, music. I didn't know the Krusty Krab had a lounge. [throws her meal aside] Ooh! [opens the door and sees SpongeBob playing music]
[The other customers peak in and notices SpongeBob's music playing.]
Sandals: Shake a leg!
SpongeBob: Oh, come on in, everyone. Try the funk, it's fresh.
[All of the customers enter the break room and joins SpongeBob's dance party. Nat spins around on the floor and drills himself down. The moldy food gets into the groove as well.]
Blobby: [dances with a sea urchin] I sure dig that! There we go, yes!
[Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs exits his office and notices the restaurant completely empty.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Where'd all me paying customers go? [his eyestalks start feeling the musical beat] What—[stops his eyestalks from moving] Ow! What the— [opens the break room door and sees everyone dancing to SpongeBob's music] A party?! I don't remember charging anyone for a party on me premises!
[The labor authority officer was enjoying himself in the party as well.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah!
Mr. Krabs: [turns on the light] All right, that's it! Five minutes are up, SpongeBob! Break's over, everyone out! Everyone out! Out, out, out, out, out!
[All of the customers including the labor authority officer exit the break room in sadness.]
Labor authority officer: You're in compliance this time, Krabs. [gives Mr. Krabs the clipboard and turns to the customers] After-break at my house!
[The customers cheer and leave the Krusty Krab to have a party at the labor authority officer's house.]
SpongeBob: [exits the break room] Oh, Mr. Krabs, that was so much fun! I can't wait for my next break in 20 years!
[Mr. Krabs closes the door and hammers it shut with wood. Then he seals it up with bricks, more wallpaper and steel. Then puts a large boulder in front of it so no one can see the entrance to the break room.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs and rubs the dust off his claws] Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it, boy-o, 'cause it's time you got back to making me money.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs laughs as he heads back to his office. SpongeBob heads back into the kitchen to resume his job. He comes back out and notices the register boat is empty. Squidward is no where to be seen.]
SpongeBob: Hmm, wonder where Squidward got to. Oh, well. [heads back to the kitchen]
[The screen zooms back into break room and Squidward is relaxing inside. Squidward appears to be unaware that Mr. Krabs inexplicably trapped him inside. But as he sighs happily, he doesn't seem to care if he's stuck in the break room forever.]
Blobby: Hey, bub, have you seen my lid anywhere?
Squidward: [kicks Blobby away] Sorry, I'm on my break.


[Squidward is sleeping.]
Patrick: Could you pass the chips, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick. We're all out.
Patrick: Oh, barnacles! What am I going to do with all this dip!? [SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting in chairs beside Squidward's bed.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Squidward screams.]
Squidward: What are you two morons doing?
SpongeBob: Waiting to watch the sunrise with you.
Squidward: At 3:47 in the morning?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Squidward: In my bedroom?
SpongeBob: We come here every morning.
Squidward: You sneak into my house every morning?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [Squidward groans.]
Patrick: It's our favorite pastime.
SpongeBob: Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. They're all here in this memory book. [points to pictures] Here we are on the Fourth of July. And Valentine's Day. Oh, you looked so cute on Easter. [Squidward is groaning angrily.] What's wrong, Squidward?
Squidward: Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasp] Story time!
SpongeBob: Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave. [happy gland sneezes]
Squidward: And that is why I will never, for as long as I live, and throughout all time and eternity, ever--
French Narrator: 3 hours later...
Squidward: And with every fiber of my being, I know that I never want to see you two again--
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: --for as long as time shall stand.
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward?
Squidward: What? [the sun can be seen rising outside]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh.
SpongeBob: Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward.
Squidward: Get out! [later that morning, Squidward is putting up a fence around his house] Perfect.
SpongeBob: Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fencewarming party.
Squidward: Oh, of course. Come, have a seat. The picnic's about to start. [cut to later]
SpongeBob: Oh, this is so neat.
Patrick: I've never picnicked on a catapult before. Have you, SpongeBob? [Both are launched over the fence.]
Squidward: It worked! Now I just turn on the electric fence. [turns it on] Now, they'll never get back in. [SpongeBob and Patrick land inside the fence area.]
Patrick: Let's do it again.
SpongeBob: Let's do it again.
Patrick: Can we, Squidward?
Squidward: Huh? What? No! Get out!
SpongeBob: But--
Squidward: No! You're going out this door, right now-- [touches the doorknob and gets electrocuted]
SpongeBob: You're not mad at us, are you, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? [Squidward's brain is not storming anymore and has a rainbow over it.] Well, okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you need us.
Squidward: Do they have cute sea horses there?
SpongeBob: Yeah, they're pretty adorable.
Squidward: And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
Squidward: Can I come?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasp] Ooh—yeah. [cut to a montage of events: Squidward is petting a sea horse, riding in a wagon while SpongeBob and Patrick pull him, riding a Ferris wheel and taking pictures in a photo booth. Later, the bus drops them off in front of Squidward's house. Squidward runs inside] Good night, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Did you notice anything different about Squidward?
Patrick: Uh, new glasses?
SpongeBob: No, no. I mean he seems happier.
Squidward: [calling from his bedroom window] Good night, Bikini Bottom. I love you! [closes the window]
Patrick: He's probably happy about his new glasses.
[cut to exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple at sunrise. The rooster crows, light slowly fills SpongeBob's room, and then his foghorn alarm sounds. SpongeBob wakes up. He goes to turn off his alarm, but he pokes Squidward's nose instead.]
Squidward: Good morning, SpongeBob. [as the alarm goes off again] Honk!
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing here?
Squidward: You were right, SpongeBob. Watching the sunrise together is much better.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward. [gets out of bed] I guess I better get ready for work. Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly. [SpongeBob reads the newspaper while sipping his coffee cup.] The new Squidward sure is helpful. [SpongeBob finishes brushing his teeth, but is surprised when Squidward starts flossing them for him] Huh? The new Squidward sure is hygienic. [SpongeBob and Squidward leave for work together] Boy—the new Squidward sure is chummy. [wanting a little personal space, he moves to the right side of the driveway, but Squidward does too; cut to the Krusty Krab] Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mr. Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us. [Squidward squeezes between them.]
Squidward: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [screams] S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front?
Squidward: I wanted to help you work.
SpongeBob: What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks work alone. And, uh-- [pokes his head out the order window] --we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! [grabs him and brings him out front] Stop distracting SpongeBob and serve the customers!
Squidward: How are we today? Everything a-okay here?
Tom: What do you mean?
Squidward: How's your meal? Anyone need tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke. [puts a Krusty Krab hat on the kid]
Little Kid Fish: [holds Mable] Mommy, I'm scared.
Squidward: Who wants a free refill?
Mr. Krabs: Did someone just say "free"? [runs out of his office] What's the problem here?
Little Kid Fish: He- he-- he asked me if I wanted tartar sauce, [she shows Mr. Krabs the Krusty Krab hat Squidward gave her] and then he gave me a free hat!
Mr. Krabs: Free?! [eyes dry up] Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up. Me customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you can't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob. [SpongeBob comes out of the bathroom and sees Squidward holding a plate of patties.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Squidward, what are you doing?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice and you'd never be up to it. [He is about to throw the patties away until Mr. Krabs comes in.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? What are you doing with those patties?
SpongeBob: Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made them.
Mr. Krabs: They look okay to me.
SpongeBob: But he's not a real fry cook.
Mr. Krabs: He is now. Give him an apron and put him to work. You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you. [SpongeBob whimpers and his eyes get so small they fall out. Cut to later where both SpongeBob and Squidward are at the grill.]
Squidward: Wow, SpongeBob! You've been Employee of the Month a gazillion times. I wish I could be employee of the month.
SpongeBob: Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. Keep dreaming.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What's the meaning of this?
SpongeBob: What's wrong with it?
Mr. Krabs: A smiley face with dimples? [Mr. Krabs shows a patty with a smiley face and dimples.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Dimples? It was him! New Squidward did it. [smiles smugly, expecting Mr. Krabs to be upset at Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: I have one thing to say to you, mister. Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do! [SpongeBob's eyes and mouth open wide and he freezes] You're the new Employee of the Month. [takes his picture. Shocked, SpongeBob breaks into pieces.]
Patrick: [walks into The Krusty Krab with a pink box in his hand] Special delivery. For this month's Employee of the Month. I wonder who it could be. As if I didn't know. [SpongeBob doesn't say move.] No, really. who is it? I don't know.
SpongeBob: The guy you're looking for is over there. [points to a crowd of customers and Mr. Krabs throwing Squidward up into the air with excitement, then starts crying softly]
Patrick: Oh. SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes?
Patrick: I want you to pull yourself together, okay? And then I want you to--
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm?
Patrick: Help me spell 'Squidward'. [opens up the pink box to reveal a cake that reads "Congratulations SpongeBob: Employee of the Month"]
SpongeBob: Okay. [changes "SpongeBob" to "Squidward"]
Patrick: Thanks, SpongeBob. Party at my house! [cut to Patrick's house where they have the party and a banner reading "Squidward Rocks" is put up and everyone, including Squidward is in a conga line. SpongeBob, however, chooses to sit at a table by himself and stare at his piece of cake]
Squidward: Enjoying the party, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob sniffles] How's the cake, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward. [sniffles] It's a very okay cake. [sniffles]
Squidward: I love being Employee of the Month.
SpongeBob: Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you? [sniffles yet again] Doesn't matter. And so what if Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month? And so what if New Squidward is pogo-dancing with your best friend? [gasps loudly as his eyes get exaggeratedly wide and bloodshot] Pogo-dancing with your best friend?! [Patrick and Squidward are bouncing on pogo sticks. SpongeBob whimpers then gets angry] Stop! [the party stops] Maybe you can take my job! And maybe you can take my place on the employee of the month wall of fame! But nobody, and I mean nobody, pogo dances with that guy [points to Patrick] but me! [confiscates Squidward's pogo stick] Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub! [Squidward tearfully leaves and goes over to touch the doorknob on the electric fence, which is still on, and gets electrocuted, causing the power in Patrick's rock to go out for a second. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are on pogo sticks] You know, Patrick. maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he might be a good fry cook. and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world [gasps] I know. I'll go apologize. Come on. [goes over to Squidward, still being electrocuted] Squidward, I just want to say I'm sorry for being so selfish, and yelling at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking, pictures on the wall and dancing. We're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put her there.
Patrick: He's too proud.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'll just meet you all the way. Lay one on me, pal. [grabs Squidward's hand and gets electrocuted, too]
Patrick: Hey, I want to dance funny, too! [gets electrocuted, too. The OFF/ON switch explodes and the electric fence is no more.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Patrick! What are you two still doing here?
[the electric fence has turned SpongeBob and Patrick mean, like Squidward]
SpongeBob: [nasal voice] What are you talking about?
Patrick: [nasal voice] Yeah, what's the big idea? [SpongeBob and Squidward start bickering simultaneously] I don't need this aggravation! Why are you still standing here?!


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The customers are running wild with hunger and are gnawing everything in sight. A barrel crashes onto Mr. Krabs' office door.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! [dodges an incoming axe] What is happening in me restaurant?!
Squidward: The customers have gone crazy! [screams as Monroe was thrown in the kitchen] SpongeBob is late for work, so there's no food!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps then grabs and shakes Squidward] But he's never been late for work in his life! Oh, this can only mean one thing. [hops on a table and rings the bell] SpongeBob has passed away!
[The customers pause for a moment and cry.]
Mr. Krabs: Or...maybe he's just seriously injured. [chuckles]
[The customers cry once more.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah, that's still bad, isn't it? [sobs along with the customers]
Squidward: [files his tentacle] I had no idea you cared that much about SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Squidward] Of course! He's been a loyal employee. His passing would be a great loss to me bank account. Oh, I—to me personally, of course. Now, come on, we have to go check on SpongeBob's possible remains.
Squidward: With pleasure! [smiles sadistically; but Mr. Krabs stares angrily at him] What? Too soon?
[The scene changes to SpongeBob's pineapple. The sky is gray and the scenery looks gloomy. Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and the customers are outside SpongeBob's bedroom door.]
Mr. Krabs: Prepare yourselves for the horror. [the customers quiver, but Squidward gives a sadistic smile] Or the joy. Let's not be downers about this.
Bikini Bottomites: Oh, yeah. Okay.
Mr. Krabs: But probably, like I said, the horror!
[The customers gasp while Squidward grins maliciously. Mr. Krabs peeks in through the bedroom door. Inside, SpongeBob is still in bed with Gary sleeping on him. Gary is licking SpongeBob to get him to wake up.]
Mr. Krabs: Neptune's nightmare! That snail is eating SpongeBob's face! [rushes over to SpongeBob's bed and grabs Gary] Get away from him! [pulls Gary off of SpongeBob]
Bikini Bottomites: [overlapping chatter] Such a nice kid.
SpongeBob: [wakes up] I—I— [babbles and shakes his head before the lights turn on] Oh, good morning, everyone.
[Everyone gives SpongeBob disappointed looks and they all walk out. Mr. Krabs and Squidward stay behind to talk to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] SpongeBob, you're alive!
SpongeBob: I am? Well, thank goodness. Wait, why wouldn't I be alive?
Mr. Krabs: [sets SpongeBob down] You were late to work, so we assumed the worst.
Squidward: [rolls his eyes in annoyance] You mean, "the best."
SpongeBob: Late to work? But that's impossible! My trusty alarm clock always waked me up. [holds up his alarm clock] See? [sees it unplugged] Well, how do you like that? It's unplugged. Well, we'll just fix that and I'll never be late again.
[SpongeBob goes to plug his alarm clock back in. But the alarm clock falls over and goes bouncing around the bedroom. SpongeBob hides under the covers to prevent himself from getting hit. The alarm clock bounces back from the bed and flies under Squidward. The alarm clock bounces back from a wall and hits Squidward in the back of his head, breaking it into bits of pieces.]
SpongeBob: [catches Gary] Oh, my clock!
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs stand up and see pieces of the alarm clock everywhere. The blowhorn part of the alarm clock is stuck through Squidward's neck. Squidward falls over and the blowhorn breaks.]
Mr. Krabs: Looks like you need a new clock, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Oh, I could never replace my old clock, Mr. Krabs. We've been through a lot together. [hugs the remains of his alarm clock] It's the only alarm clock I've ever owned. I can fix it.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, good luck. But you better not be late tomorrow. [leans in closer to SpongeBob's face] Or else.
Squidward: [rubs his head] Did that stupid clock give me a bump on my head?
[Squidward shows a clock-shaped bump on his head. A woman screams in the background.]
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: [grossed out] Ugh!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob trying to fix his broken alarm clock.]
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, come on. I still love you. Let me fix you. [flicks the part] Wow!
[The clock part flies into Patrick's mouth. Patrick wakes up from sleeping and swallows the part.]
Patrick: Ooh, hey, SpongeBob, what're you doing? [hops off his rock and goes over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm just trying to fix this old alarm clock. I'm gonna need that part you swallowed, by the way.
Patrick: That's cool. Just give a couple of hours. You know, [looks through SpongeBob's magnifying glass] I could totally fix your clock for you. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know, Patrick. This clock means a lot to me and— [sees Patrick making an eager giggle] Well, okay, are you sure?
Patrick: Absolutely. Don't you worry. I promise to be super careful. [grabs some parts and tries to put them together, but they don't fit; he smashes them together in frustration] Why don't you fix?! [screams wildly as he grabs the blowhorn and smashes everything in pieces until he stops] Hmm? Uh... Sorry, SpongeBob, I couldn't fix it.
SpongeBob: Thanks for trying, Patrick, but I guess nothing lasts forever. Looks like I'm gonna need a new clock after all.
Patrick: Hmm! [laughs] In that case... [kicks some parts around and body slams them]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the clock store. He enters the store and loads of clocks are hanging on the walls.]
SpongeBob: Um, hello?
Con man: [pops out of the coo-coo clock] Hello, there! [shakes SpongeBob's hand] Welcome to Clock World, where we always have time [shows an alarm clock under his hat] for a bargain. How can I help you?
SpongeBob: [holds out a bag of the remains of his alarm clock] Do you have another alarm clock like my old one?
Con man: Hmm… [takes some of the clock's remains, licks it and examines it] Ah, the 740 Foghorn Wake-Em-Up Grand. I'm sorry to say they don't make this model anymore. But if you have a second, [shows SpongeBob a vast amount of clocks] I have many others I can show you. [giggles]
SpongeBob: Wow. So many to choose from. [his eyes are shown as clocks] Oh, I'll never be able to choose a clock with this many choices. I'll just take 'em all! [takes out a bunch of money and gives them to the salesman]
Con man: Ah! I'm rich! [laughs manically as he leaves the clock store] Whoo! [rushes over to the yacht store and gives the money to the yacht salesman] Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! [hops into a yacht and drives away]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting a fire hydrant alarm clock.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: My old foghorn clock was the only alarm clock that could wake me up. Sure hope one of these works. [shows a huge pile of alarm clocks he bought] Goodnight, Gare-bear. [hops into bed and goes to sleep]
[Gary goes to sleep as well. The next morning, the fire hydrant alarm clock goes off and scares Gary. The firefighter figure sprays water in SpongeBob's body, making him bigger. But SpongeBob continues to sleep.]
French Narrator: One hour later...
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? [panics and rushes over to the Krusty Krab, but trips over due to being to big from absorbing the water]
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant. Mr. Krabs is angry with SpongeBob while Squidward finds this very amusing.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Late.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting his punching bag alarm clock.]
SpongeBob: I hope this one works. [hops into his bed and goes to sleep]
[The next morning, the punching bag alarm clock unzips itself. A bell is heard in the background and a boxing glove punches SpongeBob out of bed, injuring him in the process.]
French Narrator: Late again...
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant again, this time on a wheelchair. Mr. Krabs is still angry with SpongeBob while Squidward still finds this very amusing.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob's cast] Late!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sleeping in his bed with his jellyfish hive alarm clock set. It goes off and jellyfish fly onto SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gets stung by the jellyfish]
French Narrator: You get the idea!
[SpongeBob meets up Mr. Krabs and Squidward outside the restaurant again with his body all puffy from the jellyfish.]
Mr. Krabs: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Late! [shows SpongeBob on fire with a late paper] Late! [shows SpongeBob with a clam eating his head and with a late paper on its shell] Late! [shows SpongeBob as a pile of dust on the ground with a late flag] Still late! [shows SpongeBob with arrows sticking through his head and a late paper] Late! [shows SpongeBob getting late papers all over his face] Late, late, late, late, late, late, late!
Squidward: [sticks a late paper on SpongeBob] Still late. [smiles maliciously at SpongeBob as he whimpers ]
Mr. Krabs: Late again. [the papers fall off of SpongeBob] I told you before that you best not be late or else! But this time, I'll be emphasizing it with a furrowed brow. [looks closer at SpongeBob] Or else.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sitting in his chair, thinking about what Mr. Krabs said.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know how many more "or elses" I can take. [looks at the alarm clock next to him] I have to figure out a way to wake up on time.
[The alarm clock rings. Gary meows excitedly and runs over to his food bowl. The feeding machine pours snail food into his bowl and Gary eats it.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what a great idea!
[SpongeBob gets up from his chair, takes all of the alarm clocks and goes off to do something with them. It took him all night long until morning arises. SpongeBob, who is now tired, goes back into his house. He climbs into bed and goes to sleep. Just then, the alarm system rings loudly and shines 6:00 down at him. The punching bag alarm clock punches SpongeBob out of his bed and lands into a wagon. The fire hydrant alarm clock sprays water at the wagon and sends SpongeBob to the door. The cuckoo clock ejects a boot and gives the wagon a little push. Outside the house, a loud thud and buzzing noise is heard. A clock with a spring pushes SpongeBob out from the front door. SpongeBob then rolls himself down the street into downtown Bikini Bottom. The street line of clocks push SpongeBob gently further down the street with their pendulums. SpongeBob rolls over to a clock in the middle of an intersection. The giant hand pushes SpongeBob to the other side. SpongeBob rolls through a painting scene that looks similar to The Persistence of Memory painting. Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs and Squidward are anxiously waiting for SpongeBob to arrive.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, I really thought that last "or else" would've worked. Maybe I should've wagged my finger.
[SpongeBob continues to roll down the street. The wagon stops and gets sucked into the sand. The sand turns out to be part of an hour glass. The door of the hour glass opens and SpongeBob rolls out while covered in sand. Sand flies off of SpongeBob's face. The wagons rolls SpongeBob right past Mr. Krabs and Squidward and into the front doors of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is really happy that SpongeBob made it to work while Squidward stood there in complete disbelief.]
Mr. Krabs: Right on time! [turns to another sponge named SpongeTom while Squidward groans in defeat] Looks like I won't be needing you after all, SpongeTom.
SpongeTom: [drops his spatula] Oh! [stomps away]
[SpongeBob rolls into the restaurant and crashes into the register boat. SpongeBob flies into the kitchen and kicks a plank, knocking over a barrel.]
SpongeBob: [half awake] Good morning...
[The barrel hits SpongeBob's head and puts his working hat on. SpongeBob continues to sleep as some wood burns on the grill, giving away some smoke. The smoke goes up the chimney, activating the log-shaped cuckoo clock. The clock's archer figure shots an arrow at Gary.]
Gary: Meow! [groans as he pulls the roll for SpongeBob's contraption]
[It turns out that SpongeBob spent the entire night at the Krusty Krab, building a contraption out of the alarm clocks he bought. The contraption is made to create Krabby Patties for the customers. As ingredients are being hung over a rope, one clock uses its pendulum to cut the patties in pieces. One cuckoo clock blasts fire at the patties. A lighthouse clock rolls out the buns. One clock spirts mustard and ketchup on the buns. All of the ingredients fall into the funnel and form into Krabby Patties. One patty falls on a catapult. It flings the patty toward a sleeping SpongeBob. SpongeBob's snoring blows a bubble for the patty to fly into. The bubble with the patty inside floats over the window. It pops and the patty falls on the plate, ringing the bell.]
Squidward: [takes the patty and gives it to the customer] Sadly, it looks like your order's on time today. [gives the customer the patty and the bell rings again for the next order] D'oh!
[The customer sticks a dollar in Mr. Krabs' pants.]
Mr. Krabs: [gleefully giggles and goes into the kitchen with his pants full of money] Glad you finally woke up on time, boy-o! [laughs as he leaves the kitchen]
[SpongeBob continues to sleep while the contraption continues making patties.]
SpongeBob: [sleepily] Just five more minutes, Gary. [leans over until Gary pushes him up]
[Squidward gives another customer a patty. Just then, Bubble Bass cuts in front of the line.]
Squidward: Sir, there's a line.
Bubble Bass: I'm filing a complaint. [holds out his half-eaten patty] I ordered this with extra pickles. And I only count fourteen.
Squidward: [places Bubble Bass' patty on the window] SpongeBob, we got a wrong order.
[SpongeBob continues to sleep. His snoring blows a bubble and floats a patty to the window. The bubble pops and the patty lands on the grill, setting it on fire. The fire builds up so much power in the chimney that is makes the wood-shaped alarm clock shoot various arrows at Gary. Gary yelps in pain and runs off while pulling the contraption's rope. SpongeBob's clock contraption goes haywire and it clogs up the funnel, making it explode and leaving the kitchen a total mess.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes in after hearing the explosion] What in Poseidon's beard?!
SpongeBob: [gasps as he finally wakes up] Oh! Oh! Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's not a good morning. First, you're late for days, and now you destroyed me kitchen!
[SpongeBob looks around and sees the mess the kitchen is in. SpongeBob giggles nervously at his angry boss.]
Mr. Krabs: [looms his angry eyes down at SpongeBob] Oh, looks like it's—
SpongeBob: [sweating nervously] Time for "or else?"
Mr. Krabs: You better be at work on time or else [calmly] I'll have to open up and close the restaurant an hour later.
SpongeBob: [confused] Uh, what? [gets upset] No! [falls to his knees as Mr. Krabs smiles maliciously at SpongeBob]
[Suddenly, Patrick comes into the kitchen.]
Patrick: I did it! [shows SpongeBob the alarm clock and it's fixed]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Yes! Oh, Patrick, you fixed it!
Patrick: Uh, kind of.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sleeping in his bed the next morning. The foghorn alarm clock rings with Patrick making sound effects in the blowhorn. SpongeBob and Patrick share a good laugh and the screen turns black, ending the episode.]


Narrator: Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up.
SpongeBob: [jumps out of bed] Hey everybody! It's Leif Erikson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgen! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Erikson Day! There's a note.
Patrick: [as note] SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Erikson Day! Yingin-hinga-dinga! 
SpongeBob: Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me. [throws his costume away] Another note. 
Sandy: [as note] SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy. 
SpongeBob: I don't get it. The water's fine. [scene shows the treedome snowing inside] Hey, Squidward! Want to play? 
Squidward: [as note] No. 
SpongeBob: Are you sure? 
Squidward: [as note] Yes. 
SpongeBob: Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy! [lets go of the stick which falls to the ground] Nah... [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a pile of rocks] Rock Buddy! Nope... [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to a sink] Sink Buddy! "[Sink Buddy drips a little water]" Almost... [scene cuts to SpongeBob again] I've got it! [dips his bubble wand into bubble soap and blows a human shape-like bubble] Bubble Buddy! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Bubble Buddy on the seesaw] This...is...great! [scene cuts to SpongeBob going up to the Krusty Krab with his bubble] I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob walks in the Krusty Krab but his bubble just floats at the door] Don't be shy, come on! [SpongeBob squeezes the bubble through the doors] 
Squidward: Please come again. When I'm not working. Next. 
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! 
Squidward: How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway? 
SpongeBob: I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy! 
Squidward: This bubble is your friend? [sees his reflection in Bubble Buddy's face; giggles] Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be? 
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not hungry. 
Squidward: Well, thanks for stopping by. 
SpongeBob: Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet! 
Squidward: Why would I do that? 
SpongeBob: He's hungry. 
Squidward: He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here! 
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the register] What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here. [a criminal is eating a Krabby Patty] At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds. 
Squidward: I'm not taking an order for a bubble. 
Mr. Krabs: Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe. [goes back to the cash register, then he peeks at Squidward] Even if you quit. [goes back into the cash register again] 
Squidward: May I take your order? 
SpongeBob: Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you. [reads the menu] Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything. [Mr. Krabs explodes through the cash register] 
Mr. Krabs: One of everything?! Whoopee! [rips off his shirt and applies a tattoo on himself that has a heart and the words "Bubble Buddy" through it] I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table. [points his eyes to a table in the opposite direction] 
SpongeBob: Bubble Buddy's thirsty. 
Squidward: How about a glass of our finest shampoo? [laughs] 
SpongeBob: Sounds great! [Squidward looks annoyed that he took his comment literally, walks off and returns with a shampoo bottle with a straw in it] 
Squidward: Here's your hair care product, sir. 
SpongeBob: Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws. [Squidward bends the straw] Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think? 
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [chews and spits a Krabby Patty for an old lady to eat] Think of the customer. 
Squidward: [drinks shampoo] Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy. 
SpongeBob: Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties! 
Squidward: And? 
SpongeBob: Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do? 
Squidward: We? How about you take these patties and sh... 
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen; cutting him off] Mr. Squidward! [Squidward frowns in annoyance; he takes back the patty and walks off with the cart] 
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch. 
Squidward: What, is he allergic to bread, too? 
SpongeBob: Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... 
Squidward: Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style! [sets a bigger ferris wheel on the table] And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask. 
SpongeBob: That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs waves] 
Mr. Krabs: So long, boys! You see, Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day. 
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab. [hands Mr. Krabs a $100 bill made of bubbles] 
Mr. Krabs: What's this? 
Squidward: Bubble money. [$100 bill pops. Squidward shows his hand full of bubble change] At least they left a tip! [all the bubbles pop as Mr. Krabs and Squidward start growling with fury. Scene cuts to Goo Lagoon] 
SpongeBob: Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here. [Scooter runs up to SpongeBob] 
Scooter: Dudes, bury me! [laughs] 
SpongeBob: See what I mean? [fade cut] All done! 
Scooter: [buried under the sand] All right! 
SpongeBob: Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy. 
Scooter: Don't just stand there, dude. The tide's coming in. [laughs. Water reaches him] Dude? 
SpongeBob: [places Bubble Buddy inside] My friend's in there. 
Harold: Congratulations. 
SpongeBob: [goes to the music and he dances along] Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah! [everyone looks at their rears and they leave in embarrassment] 
Pearl: It's the world-famous surf punk, Grubby Grouper! 
Grubby Grouper: Later, groupies! [shakes Pearl's hand] Grubby's got to go catch some gnarly pounders. Ahoo! 
Pearl: [looks at her fin which is dirty now] Oh, I'll never wash this flipper again. [SpongeBob walks up with Bubble Buddy] 
SpongeBob: Hey, Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy! [rubs Bubble Buddy's hands on Pearl's dirty flipper, her flipper is now clean. Pearl sobs. Scene cuts to the port-o-potty] It's his first time on his own. 
Harold: Once again, congratulations. [later, the line is longer. Picture scrolls over to where we see a sign that reads '45 minutes from this point'] 
Man: Popcorn! Peanuts! 
Lou: [sounding desperate] Ice cold drinks! 
Harold: [camera stops on Harold and SpongeBob as SpongeBob whistles and Peterson struggles to hold it in. Unable to take the wait anymore] Two hours is long enough! That's it! [opens the port-o-potty door to see Bubble Buddy] 
SpongeBob: Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished! [takes Bubble Buddy away, leaving everybody to glare at them] 
Francis: He kept us waiting for a bubble? 
Larry: That's nothing! He called us fat! [along with others, he begins crunching on celery stalk] 
Pearl: [crying as she shows her clean flipper] He washed my flipper! 
Mr. Krabs: [storming up] He owes me money! 
Squidward: [following Mr. Krabs] He made me provide excellent service! 
Scooter: [appears with a halo and angel clothing on] Dudes! He made me experience high tide! [floats up towards the surface while laughing] 
Tom: He poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses! 
Protesters: He did? 
Tom: No... But are we just gonna wait around until he does? 
Mr. Krabs: I say we tip something over! [all yelling] 
Lifeguard: Hey, hey, hey! [everyone tips the lifeguard stand] 
Protester: Now what? 
Protesters: Get the lifeguard! [they go to the lifeguard, but Squidward stops them] 
Squidward: Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems! [holds up a needle] Who's with me? 
Protesters: [all hold a needle] Pop the bubble! [all yelling] 
SpongeBob: [everybody surrounds them] Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy? 
Protesters: Yes... 
SpongeBob: Hey, is this one of those sewing circles? 
Protesters: No... [group steps in closer] 
SpongeBob: Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable. 
Larry: SpongeBob, that bubble's got to go. 
SpongeBob: Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern. 
Pearl: No. "Go" as in... [blows a bubble gum until it pops] 
SpongeBob: [screams] Why?! 
Mr. Krabs: You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it! 
SpongeBob: No! I won't let you! [blows Bubble Buddy until they begin floating] Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never! [both start to get lower to the ground and the group surrounds them both again] Never... 
Squidward: Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble! 
Protesters: Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! 
SpongeBob: No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend? 
Mr. Krabs: [starts crying] Nickel Buddy, I'll never spend you! 
Sheldon: Funny Muffler... 
Larry: Jerky Pal... 
Harold: Boo-boo Keys... 
Man: Snake Eyes... [together with Harold] We love you! [burst into tears] 
SpongeBob: So, what do you say? 
Protesters: [look at each other, then they bring out their needles] Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! [throw SpongeBob away] 
Squidward: Let's get this over with so I can go home and play my clarinet! 
SpongeBob: Noo... [Squidward charges his needle towards Bubble Buddy in a slow dramatic manner, while SpongeBob begs them to stop. But then suddenly Bubble Buddy grabs ahold of Squidward's hand before the needle reaches the former] 
Bubble Buddy: Whoa! [all except SpongeBob gasp] Hey, don't I get a say in this? I'll see you later, SpongeBob. Things are getting a little weird around here. 
SpongeBob: So long. [Bubble Buddy gets into a bubble taxi and it floats away as it drives off] 
Bubble Buddy: Happy Leif Erikson Day! 
Squidward: He's alive? 
SpongeBob: Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes! [laughs as everyone walks off muttering and agreeing with Bubble Buddy's departure] Seems like only this morning I held his bottle. [sniffles] They blow up so fast. [weeps tears of joy while blowing his nose and runs off. A bunch of bubbles pop near Squidward except for one] 
Squidward: [thinking bubble is alive like Bubble Buddy] Uh...hi?


[a bubble with a note inside floats down in Bikini Bottom]
Woman: [hanging up clothes to let them dry. The bubble knocks the clothes off the rack] Hey, you stupid bubble, I just washed those!
[the bubble knocks a man's hat off, knocks Nancy's hair off, and knocks down Old Man Jenkins]
Old Man Jenkins: My spine!
Man: Why don't you watch where you're going?!
Suzy Fish: Get back here!
Old Man Jenkins: I'll sue!
[The bubble passes a fish who's eating soup, and knocks his head into the bowl. The bubble floats into SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: [About to eat cereal, when the bubble goes into his mouth. He takes it, and the note, out] Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. I wonder what's up with him. [opens letter] Let's see now. Dear SpongeBob...
[cut to Bubble Buddy writing letter]
Bubble Buddy: The Mrs. and I have to go away for a few days, and our regular bubble sitter is sick. Could you please watch our son, Shiny, until we get back? I owe you one! Your pal, Bubble Buddy.
[cut back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Please keep Shiny away from sharp objects. We don't want him to go pop like his, late Uncle Raymond. [Done reading] Oh, boy! Gary, did you hear that? They want me to watch little Shiny! I wonder when he's going to show up. The letter doesn't say. [Bubble morphs into Shiny] Oh, I can't wait to meet him! [Shiny touches SpongeBob, scaring him] Oh, there you are, Shiny! Oh, look at you! You're just as cute as the dickens! [picks him up] Upsy-Daisy! Say hello to Shiny, Gary. [Shiny blinks, and Gary hides in his shell] You're full of soap and vinegar, aren't you? I can't wait for my friends to meet you!
Squidward: [Exits his house, and SpongeBob does the same, with Shiny on his head]
SpongeBob: ♪La la la la la la la!♪ This is going to be great, Shiny! Downsy Daffodil. Squidward loves meeting new friends.
Squidward: No, I don't! [retreats into his house]
SpongeBob: You're gonna like Squidward. He's lots of fun.
SpongeBob: [knocks on door] So, how was your trip? [knocks on door, again] You don't talk much do you? Hmm. Guess he's not home. Oh, well. We'll have to try again, later. [Shiny floats away] Hey, Shiny. Where are you going? [Shiny floats into the window] You can't go in there! You weren't invited!
[crashing noises are heard from inside]
Squidward: Would you please get your friend out of my house?
[cut to the inside of Squidward's house, which is a mess]
Squidward: Where is he?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward. This place is so filled with sharp, jagged, broken things! This is no place for a little bubble boy! [spots Shiny float towards cupboards] There he is! Don't worry, Squidward. I'll get him! [opens several cupboards with the following items] Nope. Jagged glass. Barbed wire. Cactuses. Cactuses protected by barbed wire. Shh! Shiny must be in this one. Gotcha! [opens the cupboard and immediately reaches inside, jabbing himself with broken glass] No, guess not. [gasps] Oh no! You don't think he p-p-p-p-popped in there ...?!
Squidward: There he is! He's headed straight for my glass menagerie!
[Shiny slowly floats past them]
Squidward: Phew...
[Shiny floats near a broken lamp]
SpongeBob: Hold still, Shiny. Gotcha! [leaps, but Shiny dodges, and SpongeBob hits the broken light bulb, gets electrocuted, and flies into the glass menagerie desk, causing them to fall and break]
Squidward: Of course.
SpongeBob: Okay, Shiny. Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now. [tries to catch Shiny, but he misses] Barnacles!
[Shiny floats toward a spinning fan]
SpongeBob: Shiny, no!
[Shiny gets caught in the fan, escapes, and floats upstairs]
SpongeBob: Shiny, come back! [he and Squidward run upstairs] There he is! [Shiny begins to float out a window] He's headed for that open window! [the wind blows Shiny back in. Shiny grabs a paintbrush, and paints a mustache on one of Squidward's paintings]
SpongeBob: [grabs Shiny] I gotcha, you little rascal. I guess Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I spent 6 long months on that painting!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. Shiny's made of soap. We'll just wash it off. [uses Shiny to wipe the mustache off] There you go, good as new. [the painting of Squidward drips off the painting, revealing its brain, making Squidward angry] Really catches your inner self. Oh, look at the time. Time to go to work! See you there. Bye! [leaves]
[cut to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Morning, laddy. Say, what's with the glass puppet?
SpongeBob: This isn't glass! Remember Bubble Buddy? Well, I'm taking care of his son.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, Bubble Buddy, huh? That guy still owes me money! So, what's the little deadbeat's name?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, allow me to introduce you to Shiny Bubble.
Mr. Krabs: [holds out hand] Put it there! [Shiny floats in between his eyes] Hey! [almost pinches Shiny]
SpongeBob: Oh! You might wanna be careful with those sharp claws, Mr. Krabs!
[Shiny floats all over Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Come here you little rascal! [tries to grab him. SpongeBob takes Shiny away]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, I got him! Wow, look how shiny Shiny made you.
Mr. Krabs: Well, would you look at that. I never felt this clean on a weekday. Why don't you take into the kitchen and let him play with the dirty dishes?
[SpongeBob takes Shiny in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Wow, I think Mr. Krabs really likes you. You play with these while I tend to the grill. [puts Shiny on the dishes] You sure are lucky, Shiny. You get to learn the glories of the service industry.
[Shiny floats out the kitchen window]
SpongeBob: Yessiree, Shiner. You show me a sizzling grill, and I'll show you a happy customer.
[Shiny slides around on the floor, leaving behind a trail of soap as he does so. Customers begin slipping all over the place]
[Harold slides on the floor until he hits his torso directly on the side of a table]
Harold: Woooowww! Hernia.
Squidward: What in the name of Neptune is going on- [steps on Shiny and slips, sending Shiny in the air. Shiny hits the ceiling, wall, and hits the cash register, opening it and money flies out]
Customer: Money! Yay!
SpongeBob: There you are, Shiny. I'm so glad I found you. Good thing you weren't hurt.
Mr. Krabs: You better get him out of here if you wanna keep him that way! [SpongeBob runs out with Shiny] Bubbles today. They don't seem to understand the value of money.
[cut to SpongeBob walking with Shiny]
SpongeBob: That's okay, Shiny. It's too dangerous for you to work at the Krusty Krab, anyway. But, there are some fun, safe things we can do. Like stand in place, or sit in place. Or the "let's do nothing at all" game. Patrick is really good at that one. He-
[Shiny disappeared from his hand]
SpongeBob: Shiny? Shiny where are you?
[Shiny is floating toward the city]
SpongeBob: Shiny! No! You can't go to the city. It's too dangerous! [runs to Bikini Bottom] Where are you, Shiny? [looks for Shiny and finds him floating in the middle of the street] Shiny, no! Don't worry. I'll save you! [grabs Shiny] There now. Safe and sound. [gets hit by a boat] Now, Shiny, I- [gets run over by another boat] Now, Shiny, you might- [gets run over by several more boats] That was a close one. Okay, now. Let's get you to my house and keep you away from sharp pointy things.
[Shiny floats away]
SpongeBob: Oh, tartar sauce. Oooh!
[two boats collide and almost hit Shiny. Shiny floats in a pin factory]
SpongeBob: "Bikini Bottom Pin Factory"?! Shiny, no! I'll save you! [goes inside. SpongeBob is heard screaming. He comes out with pins stuck in him, and Shiny] You need to watch where you're going. You could get popped in a place like that. Hold on. There's something tickling my nose. [pulls the pin from his nose, and deflates. He blows himself back up]
[Shiny floats away]
SpongeBob: Where's Shiny? Oh, no! [Shiny floats into the Bikini Bottom Scissor Works] "Scissor Works"? I'll save you, Shiny! [goes inside. Clipping noises are heard. SpongeBob comes out with Shiny] Oh, boy. Don't you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed! [becomes reduced to cubes. He puts himself back together]
[Shiny floats away again]
SpongeBob: Shiny? [Shiny floats in the pitchfork pantry] "Pitchfork Pantry." Of course. [walks inside] Aah. Ow. [walks out with Shiny and a pitchfork stuck in his head] Shiny, how many times do I have to tell you? No sharp, no pointy! Let's see if there's someplace safe for you to visit. Ah, that's it. "The Pillow Foundry." You'll like it in there. Pillows aren't dangerous. [goes inside and becomes surprised] Huh?
[a stock footage of a live-action factory is shown. Iron is shown being melted, steamed, and comes out on a conveyor belt. It is cut by a buzzsaw, and a guy uses a giant needle to jab the pillows and fling them into a pile]
SpongeBob: Okay, let's skip the pillow foundry. I'll just take you to my house.
[cut to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Here we are. Home safe home! You must be famish after all that running around. Now, what would a growing bubble eat? Hmm. [takes out bubble soap] I know! [blows a hot dog-shaped bubble, which bumps into Shiny, and pops. Shiny pops, too]
SpongeBob: [panicking] Shiny! Don't worry! I'll save you! [dips bubble wand into the soap puddle. He blows a monster-shaped bubble] Oh, that ain't right! [blows a dinosaur-shaped bubble] Oh, come on, now! [blows Shiny back to normal] Phew, he's okay.
[Shiny grows a second head]
SpongeBob: Uh-oh.
Bubble Buddy: Hey, SpongeBob. How's my son been faring?
SpongeBob: Oh, he's... [hides Shiny behind his back] ...doing great.
Bubble Buddy: I see you've grown a second head, again, son.
SpongeBob: Again?
Bubble Buddy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'll take care of it. [sucks Shiny into his bubble wand, and place him inside his soap bottle] So, did my son behave himself?
SpongeBob: Oh, he was a little angel... in a little devil, sort of way.
Bubble Buddy: Well, see you later.
[Shiny's head pops out of the bottle and raspberries SpongeBob before Bubble Buddy hops into an airplane-shaped bubble, which takes off]
SpongeBob: Bye-bye. Anytime you need a babysitter. In case you wanna know, I do a lot of stuff. I have Gary,... he needs feeding... and I have to check in with Mr. Krabs... and I... stand around a lot, and that keeps me busy.


[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down around SpongeBob's house and the bubble jar.]
Patrick: After you.
SpongeBob: Ah, thank you, Patrick. [dunks stick in a jar of bubbles, blows the bubble and it bursts]
Patrick: My turn. [dunks stick in a jar of bubbles, blows the bubble and it bursts]
SpongeBob: Neato. [the bubble pops as SpongeBob dunks the stick in a jar of bubbles] Watch this. [blows the bubble]
Patrick: [bored] Wow. [SpongeBob yawns as Patrick sleeps and snores as the bubble pops and he wakes up, shouts] Monosodium glutamate! [blows another bubble, then pops]
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, [sniffs] we should spice up our bubble blowing.
Patrick: Yeah, yeah. Spice. [picks up the bubble jar, close-up of it] No spice. Hmm... [throws away the bubble jar and pulls out a jar of hot sauce from his pocket, close-up of it] Hot sauce! [opens the jar with his mouth while the inside of the jar mini-explodes, then places it down] Spicy bubbles. [SpongeBob giggles as Patrick dunks the stick in the hot sauce then blows a bubble, which it flies to SpongeBob's eyes and bursts, causing the eyes to sting]
SpongeBob: Hmm... [screams as his eyes disappear, then pop back out, causing him to laugh, and then he blows a bubble and does the same thing to Patrick: screaming from the sting of the bubble]
Patrick: I wonder if hot sauce is bad for our eyes.
Both: Nah. [they laugh, then blow bubbles repeatedly toward their eyes that make them scream and then laugh]
[meanwhile, at Squidward's house]
Squidward:  [cuts a leaf from his bonsai portrait of himself] [sighs] 20 years of paint-staking care, and my bonsai portrait is almost complete. Oh! Oh, my. What's this? [close-up of leaf under the portrait's nose] I missed a spot. Not to worry. You'll be perfect soon, as perfect as me. Hmm... [tries to cut the leaf, but eventually, SpongeBob and Patrick keep screaming and laughing outside, causing the bonsai to rip off and land on Squidward's lap] [worried] Oh. Look what I've done. [cries] Oh, no!
Bonsai Squidward: [comes to life] Squidward.
Squidward: What? What? Who said that?
Bonsai Squidward: It's me, your bonsai Squidward. Will you grant me my final request?
Squidward: Of..of course. [puts the bonsai down] What...what...what is it?
Bonsai Squidward: Avenge me.
Squidward: "Avenge me?" [ominous music plays as Squidward gets angry and looks out the window, seeing SpongeBob and Patrick laughing] SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob and Patrick continue to blow bubbles in there eyes before they laugh again]
Patrick: I must have more.
SpongeBob: You want more? [inhales and blows a big spicy bubble]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you moron, you ruined my bon… [notices the bubble] ...sai. [the spicy bubble explodes and burns Squidward]
SpongeBob: Let's go to Sandy's.
[scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick walking to Sandy's house where Sandy fixes an air tank connected to her treedome]
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented.
Patrick: Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head. Now I'm as smart as Sandy
SpongeBob: Maybe even smarter.
Sandy: Smarter, huh? Well, I'd love to try out your new-fangled bubbles, Patrick, but I've got to fix these air lines to my treedome. They're all clogged up and the lack of fresh air is making me woozy.
Patrick: Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person? [breathes deeply a few times, then chuckles] Guess you're just too dumb.
SpongeBob: I know, Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you. [inhales, then starts blowing]
Sandy: That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines. [SpongeBob blows the bubbles onto the air tank which starts to burn]
Sandy: [gasps before seeing the water starting to flood Sandy's treedome]
SpongeBob: Oops.
Sandy: I'll tar and feather you nincompoops later. My suit's air supply is nearing empty. Luckily, I have just enough air in my submarine to get to the surface and refill my air tanks.
SpongeBob: Phew! Thank goodness. Allow me to get the door. [opens the door, but the water comes in]
Patrick: Even I knew that was dumb.
Sandy: Oh, no! I have only a few minutes of air left! I'm far too dizzy already. You'll have to drive, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Whoo! [cuts to the submarine whirring and pinging up to the surface] How's Sandy doing back there?
Patrick: I'm not sure. Let me check. [an alarm beeps] Oh!
Sandy: Hey there, Patty-Pat-Pat-Pat-Patrick. Careful where you're breathing. You don't want to disturb the subatomic particle rodeo. Yee-haw, micro-dawgies! Rope them molecules.
Patrick: She's totally losing it.
Sandy: [gasps and grunts, touching her face] Are there cobwebs on my face? 'Cause it feels like there's cobwebs on my face.
Patrick: Never mind. She seems fine.
SpongeBob: Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there. I can see sunlight.. [covers his face] ...horrible dehydrating sunlight. [shivers]
Sandy: Gimme that wheel, SquareButt. I know a shortcut. [the sub screeches around as SpongeBob and Patrick both scream]
SpongeBob: Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick.
Patrick: Don't worry. She's not going anywhere.
Sandy: Ahh... [licks her helmet and smacks her lips] You taste like glass. [hiccups]
SpongeBob: [the submarine reaches the surface] Blah! Fresh air. Let's hurry up and get this over with.
Patrick: Get what over with?
SpongeBob: Where's Sandy
Patrick: I thought she was with you.
SpongeBob: Uh-oh. [the engine revs]
Sandy: Hang on, fellers! I got a hankering for a Krabby Patty [the sub screeches downward as SpongeBob and Patrick both scream]
SpongeBob: Sandy, what are you doing? Air is up there.
Sandy: Yeah, yeah. Right after I grab a quick bit at the Krusty Krab. Yee-haw.
SpongeBob and Patrick: No! [the submarine crashes on the rooftop of the Krusty Krab before Sandy's gauge gets empty]
Sandy: Oh, well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore. [takes off her helmet, which the ocean water fills, before eating a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: No Sandy, you need air, not food! [shoots the Krabby Patty out of Sandy's mouth with her tail]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! What's going on out here?
SpongeBob:  [as Sandy holds her breath in] Mr. Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe. We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup.
Mr. Krabs: Well, okay. I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab. That'd be bad for business. All right, let's see here. Hmm... Oxygen. I believe. Good old atomic number eight.
Sandy: [moans angrily] 
Patrick: Uh--uh-- [his bones crack] Hey, everyone. Look! There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling.
Mr. Krabs: But how are you gonna get them down? 
SpongeBob: Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down.
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute. Those straws cost me money!
SpongeBob: [while connecting the straws together] Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll put them all back. 
Patrick: Hurry up, SpongeBob. I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue. 
SpongeBob: Okay, I'm ready. 
Patrick: Just a little bit further. Okay, got it. 
SpongeBob: Hurry up, Patrick. [Patrick starts sucking bubbles with straws] 
Sandy: Hm-mmm. [Patrick holds a nut before Sandy sniffs it and punches Patrick] 
Patrick: Looks like her color's coming back. 
SpongeBob: That's good, but is it gonna be good enough? Mr. Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air. 
Squidward: I said what? 
Mr. Krabs: So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye? Well, in this case, you're right. There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell. [to Sandy] Go ahead. Don't be shy. [Sandy grunts and puts her head on Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob starts clicking Mr. Krabs' arm back and fourth] 
Pearl: Daddy, there's a submarine on the roof. Oh, you seem kind of busy. Maybe I should come back later. 
SpongeBob: [stops Pearl] No, Pearl. Don't go. You're a mammal, right? 
Pearl: Yeah, I guess so. 
SpongeBob: And you breathe air, right? 
Pearl: Sure, my nose is full of it.
SpongeBob: You've got to help Sandy. She needs to share your air.
Sandy: [whimpers while being held by SpongeBob]
Pearl: I guess us mammals have to stick together.
SpongeBob: Okay, hold still. This may pinch a little [places Sandy on Pearl's head] Okay, Pearl let 'er rip. [Pearl breaths and Sandy inflates] Now just keep breathing, Pearl. Come with me, Patrick. I have an idea that'll fix everything. [they go outside to the back] I'm gonna go up to the surface to get some air. [while tying a rope around his foot] When I tug on this rope, you pull me down.
Patrick: But how are you going to get up there?
SpongeBob: I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket.
Patrick: An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy.
SpongeBob: I know. Wish me luck, old friend. [uses a wrench and opens the oxygen tank]
Patrick: [salutes] SquarePants, I salute you.
SpongeBob: [gets to the surface before he gasps, then he opens the jar of bubble soap and pours it on his head] Okay, SpongeBob, it's time to catch a breath for Sandy. [inhales] So fresh it hurts. [squeaks and forms a huge air bubble] Okay, Patrick, pull me down. [tugs the rope with his leg] 
Patrick: Hey, who did that? Hey! Oh! Ghost! [screams before running away] 
SpongeBob: Yeah, here we go. [goes underwater] 
Patrick: Ah, ah! Oof! [starts rolling down the hill and rolls into Sandy's treedome with the big bubble] 
SpongeBob: [as Sandy wakes up] Welcome back, Sandy. 
Sandy: I'm alive? And the treedome's full of air? And sort of dry? How'd you fellers pull it off?
SpongeBob: Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble. [SpongeBob and Patrick both snicker]
Sandy: Hmm... In case you forgot, it was bubbles that got us into this mess in the first place. I don't want you blowing anymore bubbles around my house.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-oh. [Sandy's house begins floating in the giant bubble]


[The episode begins with a montage of a brand new location, Bubbletown, a local city that is made entirely out of bubbles.]
Narrator: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the most fascinating place on Earth, Bubbletown! A bouncing, vibrant city, where everyone...[four bubble ducks quack] and everything is comprised entirely of globules of air!
[A bubble family forge into one big bubble. The bubble then pops into a million bubbles. SpongeBob, who is visiting Bubbletown, is fascinated at the scenery.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [brings it around town] A whole city made of bubbles! I'm so excited!
Narrator: Let's take a closer look at this effervescent city! Some bubbletowners drive to work in their bubble cars. While others simply float. Having a bubble car is great because parking is a cinch! [a bubble person pops his bubble car] Bubbletown also provides excellent public transportation. Seats are always available because these high-tech buses can account for any number of passengers. [a bubble bus lets out several bubble people] Here are some workers going to work in their bubble building.
[The bubble workers enter their building through the bubble wall. SpongeBob attempts to do the same, but his body is too solid.]
Narrator: [laughs] You may wanna use the door. [shows a montage of bubble workers working on their bubble computers] This office uses stand-up desks, and the ceiling for a more efficient work environment.
[SpongeBob is standing upside-down on the bubble ceiling. He falls down onto the bubble floor.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, whoa-whoa. [gets engulfed in a bubble] Wow! [laughs]
[The scene changes to Bubbletown Park where a band is playing.]
Narrator: Yes, there's all kinds of things to see and do in Bubbletown! You can enjoy Bubbletown's very own band!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! [scatting and dancing until his stomach begins to growl]
Narrator: And if you're hungry, why not try a bubble dog from one of our many bubble food vendors?
SpongeBob: One, please?
Bubble hot dog vendor: [gives SpongeBob a bubble hot dog] Here you are.
SpongeBob: Mmm! [eats the bubble hot dog and suds foam out; burps loudly] Oh, yeah! I am rabid for these dogs! [laughs] Huh? Hey, it's my old pal, Bubble Buddy! Hiya, Bubble Buddy!
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gee, it's good to see ya! [hugs Bubble Buddy really tight]
Bubble Buddy: Whoa! [groans as SpongeBob accidentally splits his body in half]
SpongeBob: Uh, oops. Sorry.
Bubble Buddy: Oh, don't worry about it.
SpongeBob: So, how you been? How are things?
Bubble Buddy: Oh. Not so good, SpongeBob. On my way into town, I got a flat tire on my motor scooter. [shows his motor scooter's front flat tire]
SpongeBob: Let me see if I can fix that for you.
[SpongeBob takes his shoe off, pulls out a bubble wand, dips it in a bottle of soap, and blows the motor scooter into a motorcycle.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
Bubble Buddy: All right!
Bubble Man #1: Say, that was some pretty handy bubble work you did there, son.
Bubble Buddy: Why, SpongeBob is the best bubble blower I know. He can inflate and create anything!
Bubble Man #1: You don't say? Hey, can you help me? I've got a small leak in my roof. [shows his roofless bubble house as a bubble raincloud rains down]
Bubble Wife: Honey! [screams]
SpongeBob: I can help you? By blowing bubbles? Oh...[sighs and faints]
Bubble Buddy: And...clear! [zaps him with the bubble defibrillator]
SpongeBob: Count me in!
Bubble Man #1: Fantastic!
Bubble Man #2: Say, when you're done helping him, my house could use a new rec room!
[SpongeBob is writing a list down on his clipboard.]
Bubble Lady #1: I need some pajamas.
SpongeBob: [writes it down] Okay, mm, uh-huh.
Bubble Man #3: I want another sandwich!
[SpongeBob writes it down.]
Bubble Man #4: Monster truck tires!
SpongeBob: [writes it down] Never fear, people of Bubbletown! I'm on it!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, wearing bubble spurs and a bubble cowboy hat, makes a western cowboy stance as he looks upon Bubbletown. The bubble straw he was chewing on pops in his face. SpongeBob takes out his bubble wand and bottle of soap. He dips the wand in the soap, blows a really big bubble, and creates a brand new house for one bubble person.]
Bubble Man #1: Wow! Thanks, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob blows some bubbles and forms giant monster truck tires for one bubble person's bubble car.]
Bubble Man #4: All right! [drives his bubble monster truck away]
[SpongeBob blows some more bubbles. The bubbles hit an disgruntled old bubble man with a sore back and forms a scooter for him to ride on. The old bubble man was so happy that he begins riding in his new scooter. SpongeBob then dances around in a happy dance and forms bubble flowers all over the place.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Bubble Buddy, this has been the best day of my life! I love it here in Bubbletown! [laughs and bounces uncontrollably]
Bubble Buddy: Watch out for those—
[SpongeBob crashes into something off-screen.]
Bubble Lady #2: Excuse me, sir, but you seem to have stepped in my dogs.
[SpongeBob looks down and sees two bubble dogs in his feet.]
SpongeBob: Oh, uh-uh, pardon me, ma'am. Let me just—
[SpongeBob attempts to remove his feet out from the bubble dogs, but he slips and pops them underneath him. The dogs are now reduced to a puddle and the bubble lady gasps in horror.]
SpongeBob: Oh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [slips on the suds and lands on the bubble lady, which resulted it getting soap in his eyes] Whoa! [wails in pain] My eyes! [screams as he slips uncontrollably]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob, come back!
Bubble Groom: Amy, will you marry me? [holds out a bubble ring]
Amy: Yes! I will!
[SpongeBob slips into Amy and accidentally pops her.]
Bubble Groom: Aw. [begins to sulk, but SpongeBob slips into him and accidentally pops him]
[The bubble ring pops in mid-air. SpongeBob skids out of control and accidentally pops a line of bubble ducklings and a bubble duck. He then pops some of the bubble buildings in Bubbletown. The scene changes to the bubble mayor giving a grand opening to a new bubble elementary school for bubble children.]
Bubble mayor: I now dedicate this new school for overly cute children.
[The bubble crowd cheers.]
Little bubble boy: I wuv to learn!
[SpongeBob screams as he continue to slip on the suds. Just as the bubble mayor was about to cut the bubble ribbon, SpongeBob slips past him and pops it.]
Bubble mayor: Hey! That was my job! [gets accidentally popped by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I'm so sorry! I can't stop!
[SpongeBob accidentally pops the little bubble boy with his shoe, causing the bubble crowd to gasp.]
SpongeBob: [slow-motion] Watch out! [accidentally pops the bubble crowd and the new bubble elementary school]
[SpongeBob continues to skid out of control.]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob slips into the Bubbletown's bubble sign, bumps into a rock and lands near the shore. He lays flat on his face and cries.]
Bubble Buddy: SpongeBob! Oh thank goodness, you're okay.
SpongeBob: [gets up] No! Stay away! [shows his face covered in sand, shells, and sticks] I'm a monster! [whimpers] A monster! [Bubble Buddy gasps] Just look at the destruction I hath wrought!
[Bubbletown is now a complete mess from the destruction SpongeBob accidentally caused.]
Bubble Fred: My bubble legs!
Bubble Man #4: [his bubble monster truck's tires pop] My monster truck tires! [his bubble monster truck pops]
Bubble Buddy: Okay, that doesn't look great. [uneasy chuckle] But I'm sure we can get it all sorted out.
[A bubble police car arrives and pops, revealing a bubble police officer.]
Bubble police officer: I'm afraid the only sorting out your friend's going to be doing is in jail. For popping a large portion of the city.
SpongeBob: Okay, take me away! I'm guilty! I deserve whatever punishment you give me.
[The bubble police officer handcuffs him with bubble handcuffs. The scene changes to Bubbletown Prison. The bubble police officer gives SpongeBob the bubble telephone.]
Bubble police officer: All right, you get one phone call.
SpongeBob: Okay. [dials the number on the bubble telephone; the line thrills and a recorded voice is going] The machine, hold on. Gotta leave a message. One second. [the bubble telephone beeps; as he talks through the bubble telephone, it forms into a big bubble] Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me three life sentences, so um...so um...[sniffs] I might be late for my next shift! I'm so sorry! [pushes the bubble message out the bubble window of Bubbletown Prison and cries]
French Narrator: Later…
[Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs comes out from his office and is shocked to see a long line of starving customers. Squidward is sleeping one the cash register.]
Mr. Krabs: [yells loudly in Squidward's face] Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: [pulls his hat off to straighten out his face] Du, huh, what, who?
Mr. Krabs: What's going on here? How long have these folks been waiting to give me their money?
[Old Man Jenkins passes out and dies. His angel begins to exit his body, but he grabs it and stuffs it back in.]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm okay!
Mr. Krabs: Well…?
Squidward: What's the point? There's no one in the kitchen to make any food.
Mr. Krabs: [peaks into the kitchen and looks around; talks high-pitched] What?! Where's SpongeBob? Didn't he call in?
[Just then, SpongeBob's bubble message floats in and an image of SpongeBob appears on it as it breaks air.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs. It's me, SpongeBob. Um, I'm in jail. In Bubbletown. They gave me—[Mr. Krabs pops the bubble message before it finishes]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, barnacles. Me fry cook's in the clink. You have the conn, Mr. Squidward. I'll be back as soon as I can! [runs out to go rescue SpongeBob from Bubbletown Prison]
Customers: Wha—whoa. [fall over like domino blocks]
[Back at Bubbletown Prison, SpongeBob is lifting weights with some bubble prisoners. All of a sudden, Mr. Krabs appears and pops Bubbletown Prison wall, which resulted in freeing some bubble prisoners including the Dirty Bubble.]
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [pulls SpongeBob off] This is a prison break, boy-o. Let's get a move on! We've got a bunch of hungry customers back home, and I need your help fleecing—I mean, I mean feeding them!
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I can't go. I haven't finished paying my debt to society yet.
Mr. Krabs: [stammers] Can't go? When I say we're leaving, we're leaving!
Bubble police officer: Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!
Mr. Krabs: Eat claw, bubble cop!
[Mr. Krabs clamps his claws and spins around and around like a helicopter.]
Bubble police officer: Uh-huh?
[Mr. Krabs flies over towards to bubble police officer and chases him in the Bubbletown Prison. Mr. Krabs' sharp claws proceeds to pops everything into Bubbletown Prison and completely destroys it. He then destroys a bubble house's roof.]
Bubble Wife: Honey!
[Mr. Krabs spins uncontrollably and continuously pops all of Bubbletown until everything is nothing more than puddles of suds. The last thing he pops is a small bubble duckling, which he falls on top off.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Good thing they were all just bubbles, eh? Okay, let's get out of here. [pulls off SpongeBob's face by accident] Uh-oh. [pastes it back on him]
SpongeBob: [falls to the ground in complete shock] You popped it all. [his eyes tear up] There's nothing left!
Mr. Krabs: Forget it, SpongeBob. It's Bubbletown.
SpongeBob: No! I can't forget it. Just leave me here, Mr. Krabs. My tears will be a fitting memorial to the bubble city that I loved. [his tears form a replica of Bubbletown on the ground as he sobs]
Bubble Buddy: [shows up with a big bottle of soap] So sorry to interrupt, but I might have a solution that works for everyone!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, yeah!
Bubble Buddy: Yeah!
SpongeBob: [pops out a variety of bubble wands] Let's blow this popsicle stand. [laughs]
[The scene changes to newly blow Bubbletown. Bubbletown now has a new location that looks almost similar to the Krusty Krab in Bikini Bottom. It is known as the Bubbly Krab. The bubble groom drives away with Amy, his newly wedded bubble wife. In the Bubbly Krab, SpongeBob is wearing a bubble hat similar to the hat he wears at the Krusty Krab and is holding a bubble spatula.]
Bubble Buddy: I can't believe how quickly you inflated the whole city again, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yep! The whole city. Plus this new Krusty Krab. [shows all the bubble customers eating Bubble Patties]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs as he is counting bubble money in the Bubbly Krab cash register] Yeah! Franchisin's a great idea, boy-o! [opens the bubble cash register and pops out bubble money] I am making money claw over fist here. [stuffs the bubble money in the bubble cash register] Hey, what's the exchange rate for bubbles to real money?
Bubble Buddy: There is none! [laughs along with SpongeBob]
[All the bubble customers laugh as well.]
Bubble customers: Exchange rate? [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That's it. We're done here. [pops the Bubbly Krab, picks up SpongeBob, and leaves Bubbletown in disgust]
SpongeBob: Huh. [giggles]
[Bubble ducks walk by with a little bubble boy.]
Little bubble boy: I wuv to learn!


[at the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: Oh, brother. Just look at this place. Might as well be a mausoleum. Abysmal. Oh, well. At least it's structurally sound. [door falls on him] Forget this! I'm sick of not having any business.
Karen: Then why don't you fix this rust bucket up? Look around. Chipping paint, bad plumbing, dust bunnies-- [a literal dust bunny blows away] it's no wonder you don't have any customers.
Plankton: Okay, I get it. I get it. It's time to give this place a complete overhaul. [cut to outside the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is dragging a blue paint bucket] Whoa! Whoa! [almost falls in the bucket. Grabs the paintbrush but has difficulty painting the building] I shouldn't have to subject myself to such menial labor. [falls down with the wooden side of the paintbrush in his mouth. Then spits it out and coughs] Ah! This is a job for an imbecile! [Patrick and SpongeBob are laughing while playing leapfrog] Or two imbeciles. [laughs] Excuse me, gentlemen. I am sorry to bother you, but I'm having a bit of trouble with my abode. You see, I would like to paint The Chum Bucket to please my wife. But alas, I am too small and feeble.
SpongeBob: Aw. well, we can help you. Right, Patrick?
Patrick: Uh-huh. I came prepared, too. [holds up a watermelon and sticks his head in it] Alright, let’s do it. [cut to later]
Plankton: Okay, boys. Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz. [sparkle dust appears out of Plankton's hand]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Pizzazz, yeah!
Plankton: Oh, I know. Why don't you paint the entire Chum Bucket?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa, really?!
Plankton: Oh, yes. I need you artistic vision. You, wouldn't want to disappoint my Karen now, would you?
SpongeBob and Patrick: No, sir. Uh-uh.
Plankton: Well, hop to it, lads.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [salute] Yes, sir!
Squidward: [listening to music] Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. [suddenly gets interrupting by SpongeBob and Patrick painting the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. We like to work.
Squidward: What the--? SpongeBob, what atrocity is this?
SpongeBob: Oh. hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr. Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz! [sparkle dust lands on Squidward]
Squidward: Pizzazz, huh? What would you know about that?
Patrick: Plankton says he needs our artistic vision.
SpongeBob: Let's show him [they paint each other vigorously]
Squidward: You buffoons wouldn't know artistic vision if it hit you over the head. Now, where's the paintbrush? [takes a blue paintbrush] I'll show you what artistic vision is all about. Start with light brush strokes. [paints a little on the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh. [they lightly paint each other]
Squidward: Yeah. Perfect. [keeps on painting] Simpletons.
Plankton: Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one. [chuckles] My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap!
SpongeBob: Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get-- [clears his throat] --a drink?
Plankton: Let me show you something, SpongeBob. [opens doors] I sure wish I could offer you a cold drink for all your hard work. But alas, my pipes are rusted shut. [SpongeBob breaks the stiff liquid]
SpongeBob: I see what you mean.
Plankton: Yes. If only there was some way I could—Where'd he go?
SpongeBob: [lollygags outside] La-la-la-la-la-la-la. [Plankton laughs as SpongeBob goes into The Krusty Krab basement and takes out some pipes, which cause a leak]
Plankton: [walks up to The Krusty Krab doors] Secret formula, here I come. [opens the door and a bunch of water streams out. Plankton screams]
SpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
Plankton: Perfect. Huh? [Squidward is painting himself on The Chum Bucket. Plankton climbs up the ladder and jumps on Squidward's head] No! No! NO! It's all wrong! Don't you know a thing about art? Gimme that brush! [takes brush and paints something] Yes, yes, and yes. Voila! [bluegrass music plays as he's painted a log cabin]
Squidward: A log cabin?
Plankton: Yeah, I think they're so cozy. Now that's what you call art. [jumps off of Squidward's head]
Squidward: Everyone's a critic.
Plankton: I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with The secret Krabby Patty formula.
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from The Krusty Krab.
Plankton: SpongeBob, how do you expect me to see out of a window that high?
SpongeBob: I guess I hadn't thought about that.
Patrick: I did. [a round window is near the ground] Look, Plankton. It's the perfect height for your kind.
Plankton: See, SpongeBob? Patrick's using the old noggin. He knows I'll actually want to see out the window! [notices the window is showing a blank wall]
Patrick: Wait, you wanted to see out the window? Weird. [Plankton twitches in fury. He unscrews a bolt from the window and puts it in between his teeth and grunts. Patrick and SpongeBob look convinced at this. Then, Plankton breaks the bolt]
Plankton: CAN'T YOU TWO DO ANYTHING RIGHT? I give you one simple task after another and... [he pauses and sniffles] Just forget it. It was foolish of me to think this plan would ever work when nothing else in my life is panned out. Telemarketing, life guarding, creative writing—all such bitter failures. [cries]
SpongeBob: [picks up Plankton] Oh. It's okay, little green... creature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on The Chum Bucket. until it's the most pizzazziest [sparkle dust appear out of SpongeBob's raised hand] restaurant in Bikini Bottom!
Plankton: [crying] Really?
SpongeBob: And how. Come on, fellows. Let's do some interior decorating!
Squidward: Oh, goodbye, paintbrush. [tosses it away] Hello, antique fitting!
Plankton: Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while. [cut to later, SpongeBob and Patrick are taking apart the arch on the side of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hup-hup-hup-hup! [they throw the arch up and it comes back down on their bodies. They carry it over to the Chum Bucket while Plankton goes to the Krusty Krab] Hup-hup-hup-hup!
Plankton: I just need to sneak past Krabs, and I'm home-free. [SpongeBob and Patrick take the doors of the Krusty Krab apart and carry them back. Plankton walks inside. but when he hides behind a table, SpongeBob and Patrick take that with them. Then Plankton hides in the boat behind the cash register] Where could that stingy crab be? [SpongeBob and Patrick take the boat with them. Plankton laughs as he is hiding behind the grill, but SpongeBob and Patrick take the grill to the Chum Bucket. Then Plankton goes into Mr. Krabs office] Still don't see him. [SpongeBob and Patrick take Mr. Krabs' desk. Plankton gasps] The safe! I'm in the clear, baby! [squeezes inside the safe, then has a lantern and sees the secret formula] It's beautiful. [tears up] No. No tears. Not yet. [takes a deep breath] There's work to be done. [unscrews the bottle top] Ha-ha! At long last! [black and white crowd applauds] And the secret formula is — one bottle of molting lotion, take passport photo, get new safe travel size. This isn't the secret formula! It's a to do list!! Yaaagh!!! [screams and tears it up. Turns into a little green hulk and bursts out of the safe. When he comes out, there is nothing but the safe left] Huh!? What happened to The Krusty Krab? Huh! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHUM BUCKET?!?!?! [The Chum Bucket turned into a replica of the Krusty Krab] Curses! This isn't what I meant by renovation.
SpongeBob: I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like The Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: It looks more like Plankton trying to steal me restaurant. [steps out of a taxi with suitcases in hand and a hat on his head]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! You've returned from your vacation. [the word "Exposition!" appears above SpongeBob's head]
Mr. Krabs: And it's time for The Krusty Krab to return from its vacation. [He scuttles to the back of the building and as he grunts with effort, he pushes the Krusty Krab over to its original spot. Then flips it over to have the doors face the street]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!/Yay!
Mr. Krabs: [takes the safe out from his throat. It was covered with saliva. He takes out the formula for the patties] And I bet you tried to steal this, too.
Plankton: [sheepishly] Hehehhehheh... well, steal is such a strong word. [Mr. Krabs grabs him on the side of his eye. He screams in pain]
Mr. Krabs: You don't really think I'd leave me secret formula behind when I go on vacation. Do ya?
Mr. Krabs and Plankton: "Now stay away from me"...
Plankton: ..."restaurant, bug." I think we've been through this one before. Allow me to do the honors. Heh-yah! [throws himself back at the Chum Bucket, but doesn't scream like he always does. He lets out a blank expressionless monotone scream] Ahhhhhhhhhhh. [Plankton lands face-first on the ground, where the Chum Bucket previously was]
Karen: Oh, excellent job, genius. You really fixed the place up.
Plankton: Don't nag me, Karen. I've had a long day. [cut to later at the Krusty Krab where it's redecorated]
Mr. Krabs: Yup, Squidward. you really outdid yourself for the new decor. Where did you get the fountain?
Squidward: That, I sculpted out the concrete foundation of the Chum Bucket.
Mr. Krabs: And these metal decorations?
Squidward: Those were all fabricated from The Chum Bucket walls.
Mr. Krabs: And the computer? [SpongeBob is playing solitaire]
Squidward: Oh, that's Plankton's wife.
Mr. Krabs: Well, it looks great, lad. And it didn't cost me a dime.
Customer #1: Wow, $25 for a Krabby Patty? Rip off, dude. Not cool.
Mr. Krabs: But you're paying for enhanced ambiance—dude.
Customer #1: Well, that's true—it is pretty classy in here. Gimme four!


[The episode begins on another day at the Krusty Krab. A sweet old lady is knitting a scarf with her yarn while enjoying her meal. Mr. Krabs walks up to her.]
Mr. Krabs: And how was your meal today, ma'am?
Sweet Old Lady: Oh, delicious. I wish I could tell everyone how great my meal was.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you're more than welcome to go to each table and tell them about your satisfactory experience.
Sweet Old Lady: I don't really have time to do that. Perhaps I will mention it in my will.
[The sweet old lady takes her knitting supplies and drives away on her mobility scooter. Mr. Krabs takes out his whip and prepares to hit her.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's the way you want it.
SpongeBob: Wait! I have an idea!
[SpongeBob runs into Mr. Krabs' office and brings out a cork board. He hangs it on the window.]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on a second! That's me cork board! It's for all me... memos.
[The court board shows a memo with the words, "Make More Money" and a picture of money on the bottom.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, think of it now as a bulletin board for the community. A place where a yearning populous can express themselves freely.
[The sweet old lady knits a review about her visit and sticks it on the court board. Then she drives away on her mobility scooter. A customer walks up and reads the review.]
Ivy (gray): "My Krusty Krab meal was delicious! I cannot recommend it enough!" Huh. Well, I was just gonna loiter, but now I think I'll get a Krabby Patty.
[The customer walks off. Mr. Krabs' eyes became dollar signs and money pops out of his mouth, realizing that it is a fantastic idea. Then he closes his mouth.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, everybody! Our community bulletin board is here! Tell your friends and come on down and use it for the good of me business! Me wallet! Me...[stammers] I mean the community.
[The scene changes to customers lining up to put their reviews on the bulletin board. SpongeBob sheds a tear.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Community!
[SpongeBob and the customers look at the reviews. As time goes by, more court boards were added as more reviews keep stocking up. One puts a lost sign on it while another puts Old Man Jenkins on it. Customers continue to read the bulletin board of reviews while eating their meal. Squidward and SpongeBob continue serving the meals to the customers.]
Pearl: Oh, I really hope people like it! [laughs]
[Pearl puts a picture of a unicorn dancing under the rainbow on the bulletin board. Random customers put pictures on the bulletin board as well.]
Voice #1: Great!
Voice #2: Super good!
Voice #3: Number 1 with a star!
[Pearl laughs. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs gluing money on the walls of his office.]
SpongeBob: See, Mr. Krabs? The community bulletin board is a good thing.
Mr. Krabs: Yes. Yes it is. It's bringing me closer to my favorite part of the community. Their money!
SpongeBob: Let's see what other nice people are saying.
[SpongeBob leaves the office, but moments later, SpongeBob squeals very loud. His squeal causes the money to fall off the wall and makes Mr. Krabs fall into his sack.]
Dave: What are you shrieking about?
[SpongeBob steps in front of the bulletin board.]
SpongeBob: Nothing! I just love to shriek!
[Dave tries to look and see the bulletin board, but SpongeBob, while shrieking, prevents him from looking.]
Mr. Krabs: Step aside, boy! You're blocking me money-makin' bulletin board!
[Mr. Krabs moves SpongeBob away from the bulletin board and Dave reads the blue paper.]
Dave: "When I eat at the Krusty Krab, all I get is a dark, empty feeling inside!" P-Star7. Ouch!
[The customers murmur in wonder about the review. Mr. Krabs becomes nervous and goes to remove the review.]
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Not on my bulletin board!
Surfer Fish: Whoa, whoa, dude! What's with the censorship? The community bulletin board is for everybody. You can't just take somethin' down because you think it's bogus.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Surfer Fish is right. The board is sacred and it must be respected.
[SpongeBob pushes his nose and a pencil comes out of his head. Then he writes on a small pink paper.]
SpongeBob: Dear P-Star7, I'm so sorry you had a less than stellar experience at the Krusty Krab and we promise to do better in future. Signed, Fry-Banshee139. Crisis averted.
[SpongeBob puts his note on the bulletin board and his pencil back in his head. But he sees another note.]
SpongeBob: Huh? "Crisis averted? More like crisis dumb-blurted." Signed, Guybesideu3?
[SpongeBob sees Tyler whistling beside him. Then he sees more notes on the board.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gasps] "Dumb-blurted! LOL!"?, "What's the Point"?, "I could make a better patty out of mud"?! Where are all these notes coming from?
[Mr. Krabs is going around selling paper and pencils to the customers so they can write notes for the bulletin board.]
Mr. Krabs: Pencils, paper! Pencils, paper!
Martin: I want to express the worst side of myself!
Mr. Krabs: Heh, heh, heh. Why not? And don't forget to feed your hatred with a selection from our menu!
Squidward: Huh? [points to menu] Hmm.
SpongeBob: If only I could figure out who this P-Star7 is.
[Patrick walks in the restaurant.]
Patrick: [laughs] Hello!
[Patrick notices everyone discussing about P-Star7's message on the bulletin board. He then walks through the crowd.]
Nat Peterson: P-Star7 is my new hero.
Patrick: Hey, that's me!
Harold: Yeah, right.
Fred: He really knows how to complain.
Patrick: But I wasn't com...
[Patrick goes up to the board to put a note on it.] 
Unnamed customer: P-Star7 is cool because he's anonymous.
Patrick: [hides his note] Oh, yeah. He's cool because He's a nanny-mouse.
Bubble Bass: You may not like what P-Star7 has to say, but you have to agree that he keeps it "real". He's a true hero for our troubled times.
SpongeBob: [sighs] Well, I'll just have to make my Krabby Patties better so P-Star7 will like 'em.
[SpongeBob goes into the kitchen and attempts to make better Krabby Patties. He examines them closely and takes out a compass to see how round it is.]
SpongeBob: No, it's not round enough. Uh, maybe just a little off the edge here.
[SpongeBob cuts part of the patty with the spatula and takes out a metric ruler to measure it.]
SpongeBob: No, now the other side is wobbly. I'll just even it up a little here.
[SpongeBob even up the patty with the spatula and takes out a tape measure to measure it.]
SpongeBob: Now it's smaller than that one!
[SpongeBob takes out his spatula and tries to flatten the Krabby Patty. However, he ended up splattering it all over the place and made the Krabby Patties into a lump of meat.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: Yes?
SpongeBob: Has P-Star7 responded to my nice note yet?
Squidward: Oh, he responded hours ago.
SpongeBob: Well, why didn't you tell me?
[SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen.]
Squidward: Because I don't care.
[SpongeBob goes to the bulletin board a finds a note underneath his.]
SpongeBob: That's for me! "Fry-Banshee139, more like Cry-Baby139!" Cordially, P-Star7.
Bubble Bass: His vituperative hyperbole has certainly diminished your credibility.
SpongeBob: Oh, why did you have to say that?
Bubble Bass: You're right. I should have put it on the bulletin board instead. [writes his note and puts it on the board] Signed, HandsomeLad42.
SpongeBob: You may be handsome, HandsomeLad42, but you're very mean!
[SpongeBob runs away. The customers and Mr. Krabs cruelly laugh at SpongeBob's humiliation.]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Alright, that's a good one. Heh, heh. Hey, you know all this note-writing must be making you folks hungry. We have a short line at the register.
[Squidward is sleeping at his register.]
Sheldon: I brought a bag lunch.
[The customers reveal to Mr. Krabs that they've brought bag lunches.]
Mr. Krabs: What? Wait a second. None of you bulletin board browsers are buying me patties!
Medley Fishbowl: Why would we buy food from a place that quote [reads note on sock] "Smells like stinky armpits"?
Mr. Krabs: What?
[Mr. Krabs sniffs his armpit and crumbles to dust. Then he comes back up again.]
Mr. Krabs: That's not true!
Medley Fishbowl: Hey, it's on the board.
Bubble Bass: And the board is never wrong.
Mr. Krabs: And does anyone need to buy a pen?
[Everyone holds up their pens.]
Mr. Krabs: How about some paper?
[Everyone holds up their paper and Mr. Krabs facepalms himself in disgust. SpongeBob walks up to Patrick in tears.]
Patrick: What's wrong?
SpongeBob: It's this P-Star7. He's been saying terrible things about me and the Krusty Krab.
Patrick: Oh, I think they were all good things.
SpongeBob: Not good. He said that the Krusty Krab made him feel dark and empty inside.
Patrick: Well, he probably meant his stomach was dark and empty and he was hungry for more.
SpongeBob: No. A master of acid-wit like P-Star7 would never express himself so clumsily. He called me Cry-Baby139.
Patrick: [gasp] You were Fry-Banshee?!
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Patrick: Well, maybe he just thought it was funny. And... and when he said that Krabby Patties taste like old baseball gloves...
SpongeBob: He said that?!
Patrick: Oh, not yet!
[The scene changes to the outside of the Krusty Krab being covered by numerous reviews that are written by P-Star7.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?
Squidward: [laughs] I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!
Mr. Krabs: He's a diabolical genius! That's what he is!
[Patrick is sucking his hand in his mouth.]
Patrick: [muffled] No, I'm not.
[Patrick puts salt on his hand and continues sucking his hand. SpongeBob is shown wearing a snowsuit, a hat, and earmuffs in the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the grill's gone cold.
Mr. Krabs: Nobody's orderin', son. It's that cursed cork board! I'm gonna take it down! It's nothing but trouble!
SpongeBob: You can't Mr. Krabs! It's for the community! I'll still believe in the power of the bulletin board!
[Soon, everyone puts random notes on SpongeBob and Squidward seems to be enjoying it as he cruelly laughs at it.]
Sandals: [reads note] "You smell!"
[Laughter]
Gus: [reads note] "One of your eyes is too big!"
[Laughter]
Bubble Bass: [reads note while eating] "Close your mouth when you eat!"? [spits out food]
[Laughter]
Pearl: Oh! [reads note] "This picture looks like it was drawn by a Brine Shrimp!" Oh, Daddy! [cries]
[Squidward cruelly laughs at this until he reads P-Star7's note about him.]
Squidward: Huh? [reads note] "Squidward Tentacles should never be allowed behind a cash register." P-Star7? Oh, that is it! Why can't any of these yokels understand I'm working here? Ironically!
Bubble Bass: Oh, sure you are. P-Star7 has your number alright.
Squidward: I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!
[Squidward and Bubble Bass fight each other until SpongeBob breaks them up.]
SpongeBob: People, can't you see what's happened? This bulletin board has become a bullying board!
[All of the customers gasps in realization.]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, that's it! Everybody out!
[Everyone leaves the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob puts up the closed sign on the window.]
SpongeBob: Oh, P-Star7 is bringing out the worst in everybody. I'd like to send him a message.
Mr. Krabs: We'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!
SpongeBob: A lesson in polite manners.
Squidward: Or we could push him off a cliff.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, excellent option, Mr. Squidward.
SpongeBob: We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab late at night. SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are in the register boat as they are prepared to catch P-Star7.]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Pineapple1 to Maddaddy. Come in, Maddaddy.
Mr. Krabs: [through walkie-talkie] This is Maddaddy. I read you, Pineapple1. Any movement?
[SpongeBob looks around.]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Negatory. Pineapple1 to Delicate Flower. Come in, Delicate Flower.
[Squidward takes the walkie talkie from SpongeBob.]
Squidward: [yells loudly] I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!
[Squidward hides his flower tattoo that is on his left arm and gives the walkie-talkie back to SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs looks around.]
Mr. Krabs: Shh. Maintain radio silence. Wait a minute. I see something.
[A mysterious round figure opens the front door and rolls across the floors. The figure stops under a nearby table and licks up a ketchup stain with his tongue.]
SpongeBob: So that's what happens to the ketchup stains.
[SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs hide in the register boat. The mysterious figure walks up to the bulletin board and sticks another note on it. Mr. Krabs turns on the light and the mysterious figure turns out to be none other than Patrick Star.]
SpongeBob: Surprise, P-Star7!
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward: Patrick?!
[Patrick smiles nervously.]
Mr. Krabs: [screams in anger] I'll tear ya to pieces!
[Patrick cowers in fear as he thinks Mr. Krabs is going to hurt him. However, Mr. Krabs moves Patrick away and breaks his cork board into a million pieces. Then he removes all of the random notes off of the entire restaurant and tosses them all outside on the street.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're P-Star7?
Patrick: Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way.
SpongeBob: So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth.
[Patrick is chewing on his baseball glove.]
Patrick: Yeah, I think.
SpongeBob: You hear that, boardy? It wasn't you. It was never you. We were the monsters all along.
[SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs felt sorry about their actions and took pity on Patrick. However, Mr. Krabs resumes his anger.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh! [picks up paper] This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower.
Squidward: [takes coupon] Oh, ratfish!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Squidward, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs knitting with the sweet old lady at the Shady Shoals Rest Home.]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Pineapple1 to Knitmama. Can I needle you for a little more yarn? [laughs]
Squidward: Oh, brother. [puts the yarn bag over his head] Please bring back P-Star7.
[The episode ends with everyone laughing.]


Mr. Krabs: Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.
SpongeBob: Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?
Mr. Krabs: Fine?! [grabs SpongeBob's mouth and ties it up] Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine. [cries]
SpongeBob: Time off?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this... SpongeBob, take a vacation.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. [runs out]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that went better than expected.
SpongeBob: [running down the street] I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation. [enters his house] Hey, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary. [walks into his bed and closes his eyes for no more than two seconds before his alarm goes off. Scene cuts to him lifting his weights, eating cereal, flossing, showering, then putting on some spray to make him shine. He grabs his hat then walks into the Krusty Krab] Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.
Squidward: I thought you were on vacation.
Mr. Krabs: [stops SpongeBob] He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.
SpongeBob: What's a vacation?
Mr. Krabs: Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.
SpongeBob: [gasps] No work?! But what'll I do all day?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.
SpongeBob: But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
Squidward: Nor will I.
Mr. Krabs: That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.
Patrick: [walks in] Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.
Mr. Krabs: Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.
SpongeBob: Replacement?
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: That's enough banter on my dime.
Patrick: Ok, boss.
Mr. Krabs: Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job. [takes SpongeBob's hat and spatula and gives it to Patrick]
Patrick: Wow. [notices his reflection in the spatula] Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher. [scratches his belly and his back] Wow. It scratches backs, too!
Mr. Krabs: Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.
SpongeBob: I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique. [Mr. Krabs shuts the doors in SpongeBob's face. Scene cuts to inside SpongeBob's house]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work. [stomach growls then shrinks. SpongeBob gasps] My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside! [scene cuts to Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.
SpongeBob: I'm not here to see you, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?
SpongeBob: I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.
SpongeBob: You have my word, sir. No working. [enters kitchen] Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch... [screams as he sees Patrick putting patties, attached to his body, on the grill] Patrick, you can't do that!
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit. [turns the knob to the right from 297 to 298. Takes Patrick's spatula] Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [storms into the kitchen] SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?
SpongeBob: Wait, it's not what you think.
Mr. Krabs: [wheels SpongeBob on a dolly] Out you go, boy.
SpongeBob: But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, boy... [launches SpongeBob off] off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over. [scene cuts to SpongeBob entering his house]
SpongeBob: Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset. [sits down in front of a toy Krusty Krab with Krusty Krew figures. Opens it up]
Squidward: [SpongeBob imitating him] SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.
Mr. Krabs: [SpongeBob imitating him] SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over. [takes SpongeBob's Krusty hat off. SpongeBob walks home, sad]
SpongeBob: [walking inside his pineapple] Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up. [plays with a smaller Krusty Krab playset]
Squidward: [SpongeBob imitating him] I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house. [scene cuts to Krusty Krab where Squidward is washing windows until he sees SpongeBob]
Squidward: Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.
Mr. Krabs: I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up. [SpongeBob steps backwards] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards more] Further. [steps backwards until he is in front of his house] That'll do.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally. [looks at his net] Hey, that reminds me of... [his net turns into a spatula. Pretends to grill but stops] Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax. [floats onto the ground] That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds. [watches a cloud go by] That one's a jellyfish! [another cloud goes by] That's a pirate ship. [another cloud goes by] And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup? [scene cuts to Krusty Krab where a delivery truck backs up. SpongeBob, in a disguise, walks up to the kitchen door] Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here. [another delivery truck backs up. A delivery fish gets out with the same buns on a plate]
Delivery Fish: Huh? What's the big idea, here? [SpongeBob laughs nervously then gets booted out. Scene cuts to the phone ringing inside the Krusty Krab. Patrick answers]
Patrick: Hello? Hello? Hello? [SpongeBob slips through phone cord and through Patrick's head but gets shot out of the Krusty Krab, through the doors. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab restroom where Patrick is cleaning out his ear] Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear. [notices water splashing out from the toilet behind him] Hey, I just cleaned that one.
SpongeBob: Patrick, shhh.
Patrick: It talks! [screams and runs out]
SpongeBob: Somebody help, I'm stuck! [Mr. Krabs walks up] Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here. [Mr. Krabs grabs a cord above the toilet] Um, Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs flushes the toilet] Noooo!! [gets flushed down the toilet. Scene cuts to SpongeBob jumping out of a customers shirt and into the grease fryer in the kitchen] Uh oh.
Mr. Krabs: Now what? [picks up the fryer and sees SpongeBob small and deep fried] Tsk, tsk, tsk. [SpongeBob then crumbles into crumbs and puts him in his boat out back] I've had enough for one day, son. [drives off]
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Not a problem at all, me boy.
SpongeBob: Just take the next right. [Mr. Krabs drives past his house] Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: My house is back that way, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs: Far out, little man. Far out. [drives into a forest and stops]
SpongeBob: Where'd you say you were taking me?
Mr. Krabs: Look, boy, [takes out a spatula] I brought your spatuler. [SpongeBob glares at the spatula and acts like a dog] C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it! [throws the spatula into the forest. SpongeBob chases after it while Mr. Krabs turns around and drives off] Enjoy your vacation, boy!
SpongeBob: It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a... [gasps] ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them! [scene cuts to Patrick running down the street to his rock]
Patrick: Working at the Krusty Krab. Making Krabby Patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember. [opens his rock and jumps in] Huh?
SpongeBob: [sitting in the corner of Patrick's rock] Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire me like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
Patrick: SpongeBob? Is that you?
SpongeBob: [turns around with an evil look on his face] I've been waiting for you, Patrick! [walks towards Patrick, growling]
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh! [SpongeBob laughs maniacally and closes in around Patrick. Scene cuts to Krusty Krab]
Squidward: What’ll be?
Customer: One Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: One shell on a shingle. [Patrick gives Squidward the order then many orders come out, it blocks the window just for Mr. Krabs to notice]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it. [Patrick turns around, and it turns out to be SpongeBob in a Patrick costume] SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?
SpongeBob: Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television. [Patrick is sitting at home watching a broken TV]
Mr. Krabs: Why'd you do it, laddy?
SpongeBob: [starts to cry] Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!
Mr. Krabs: You don't have to. [takes out a calendar] Your accumulated vacation time is used up. [tears up calendar] The union can't fine me, anymore.
SpongeBob: You must've saved a fortune.
Mr. Krabs: Bumping barnacles, yes. [laughs and holds up a dime] There she is.
SpongeBob: Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
Mr. Krabs: Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.
SpongeBob: [jumps out of the Patrick costume] Yippee! I happily acquiesce.


[This episode opens up with Frankie Billy taking his driving test at Mrs. Puff's Boating School.]
Frankie Billy: Once around the roundabout. [clears the roundabout] Left at the wall. [clears the brick wall] Over the Bump of Truth. [clears the bump] And finally, the flaming hoop! [clears the hoop, then crosses the finish line. He then obtains his passing grade from Mrs. Puff.] Thank you, Mrs. Puff, I am now a car daring figure and a producing member of society. [excitedly cheers] Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Mrs. Puff: [proudly] Oh, nothing brings me more joy than teaching. I can't wait to pass my next student.
SpongeBob: [enters car excitingly] Hello, Mrs. Puff. I'm all set for my driving test. [Mrs. Puff shatters to pieces on the car floor] Mrs. Puff, you okay?
Mrs. Puff: [pulls herself back together] Just start driving. [SpongeBob accidentally floors it in reverse] Turn this boat around immediately!
SpongeBob: Right away, ma’am. [SpongeBob turns the wheel but goes around in circles knocking out all the traffic cones] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I have this under control... [accidentally pulls off the wheel, crashing into the lighthouse and the wall, tying the bump in a knot, and crashing through the ramp and the flaming hoop]
[setting switches to a house where two teenage fish are watching Goin' Bananas 3 in 3D on the television]
Announcer: Next up, Goin' Bananas 3: In 3D.
Teenage Fish #1: Hey, dude, pass the 3D glasses. This is supposed to be, like, in 3D.   
Teenage Fish #2:: Oh, yeah, right! [gets the two 3-D glasses. On the TV a fancy-looking driver appears]
Driver: Here I am! I'm coming at ya like your worst nightmare! [laughs]
[SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff crash through the wall of the house, thereby wrecking the TV]
Teenage Fish #1 and #2: [chuckling] Wow!
Mrs. Puff: I think it's safe to say you have once again, failed your driving test!
SpongeBob: [teenage fish laugh] Uh, but, Mrs, Puff, I-
Mrs. Puff: No buts, SpongeBob! You fail this test over and over! I'm beginning to think you are simply... unteachable! [teenage fish laugh again] Now, get out of my sight!
[SpongeBob shakes and begins to look upset]
SpongeBob: I...I... [starts to cry] I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff!
[SpongeBob runs off crying. Mrs. Puff is growling]
Teenage Fish: Dude, this is, like, the gnarliest 3-D movie ever!
[Mrs. Puff puffs from her anger and accidentally falls over on the teenage fish. Despite being crushed, the teenage fish still laugh about it.]
[Transition to Mrs. Puff's house where she attempts to relax. For comedic effect, the photo on the wall depicts the same scene here, in a similar way to No Free Rides.]
Mrs. Puff: If only SpongeBob could pass his boating test, he'd be out of my life once and for all. Unfortunately, I keep getting reminded of the consequences if I get too angry with the little nuisance. [shows a handcuff locked on her leg. It is beeping with a red light flashing on it] I can't even leave town without violating my parole. [groans] If there was only some way that I didn't have to live in fear. [Suddenly, Mrs. Puff gets an idea] Fear! That's the answer! SpongeBob is afraid of the driving course! So it would stand to reason that if he took the driving test somewhere else besides the driving course, he would pass! [goes outside to see cars drive by her house on the road] Of course! The answer's been in front of me all along! I'll test SpongeBob on a real road and then he'll be out of my life forever! [laughs] Yeah! What could possibly go wrong?
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob's house with all of the lights turned off. SpongeBob is tired and depressed.]
[Gary appears and meows for food]
SpongeBob: Not now, Gary. Can't you see I'm wallowing in my own filth? [groans. Suddenly, his door knocks] Come back later; I'm wallowing. [door knocks again. SpongeBob decides to get up and answer it. He opens the door to surprisingly see Mrs. Puff at his door]
Mrs. Puff: Good morning, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:  [gasps and runs away]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob? SpongeBob? [SpongeBob coughs. He is inside the TV] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff. I am trying to stay out of your sight.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, that! Let's forget what I said. It's time to take a fresh approach.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I...You said...Don't you remember? I'm un- [Mrs. Puff turns the TV on "Mute"] [Note: It's believed that he said "I'm unteachable."]
Mrs. Puff: We don't have time for this, SpongeBob. We have a long day of driving ahead of us.
[Bubble transition over to the desert. Mrs. Puff is driving. SpongeBob sees two clams cawing]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, why have you taken me to this weathery moat and slightly scary landscape?
Mrs. Puff: To overcome your fears, silly.
[They pass a skeleton pointing left and it falls apart]
SpongeBob: It's not working!
Mrs. Puff: Here we are!
SpongeBob: Uh, where are we?
Mrs. Puff: This old abandoned road is the perfect venue for your driving test.
SpongeBob: Dr-iving test?!
Mrs. Puff: That's right! You're free from all the distracting obstacles on the boating course. [she stops the boat] Out here, there's nothing but the road. [gets out of the boat] Now, scooch over. [SpongeBob doesn't] Come on. Scooch over. [lifts up the seat and wiggles it until SpongeBob is behind the wheel]
SpongeBob: [buckling his seatbelt] But Mrs. Puff, what about the fact that I'm unteachable?
Mrs. Puff: Forget all about that. Out here, you can teach a hermit crab to boat.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I'm still intimidated!
Mrs. Puff: Listen. If you're nervous about boating, simply repeat the words: "Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road." Got it?
SpongeBob: O-o-okay. [takes the wheel] Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. [gulp] Uh, focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. [presses gas pedal, covers eyes] Focus on the road. [uncovers eyes] There is nothing but the road. Hey, look at me. I'm not crashing and stuff.
Mrs. Puff: Wonderful! Keep that up and I'll have no choice but to pass you! Just repeat your mantra.
SpongeBob: Focus on the road, the open unintimidating road.
[as he says this, they ride on a curved road]
Mrs. Puff: Boating within the lines. [checks said rule off her list] Well done.
SpongeBob: Focus on the road. [activates turn signal, boat turns left] There is nothing but the road.
Mrs. Puff: Finally using your turn signal, woohoo! [checks off "uses turn signals] Check.
SpongeBob: Focus on the road. [drives the boat on a circular road] There is nothing but the road.
Mrs. Puff: Roundabout navigation, check!
SpongeBob: Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road! [presses gas pedal slightly harder, speeding the boat up]
Mrs. Puff: Safe and steady acceleration, check! [checks off said rule]
SpongeBob: Focus on the road... [drives the boat up a mountain] There is nothing but the road. [drives the boat through snow on top of the mountain and drives down it back to the road]
[Mrs. Puff checks off "Vertical driving". SpongeBob continues repeating the mantra several times. He drives the boat over loopy roads and even under the road as well. He also makes the boat jump a gap, and even ducks under a garbage truck. A psychedelic moment of his driving begins: First, he drives on what looks like a mobius strip. Then he drives over a road with another SpongeBob under it. Then, he drives up a curvy road with a SpongeBob like face, which swallows the boat. The camera pans upward to a Saturn-like planet, and SpongeBob jumps out of the planet and drives along its ringlike road. The rings break and SpongeBob flies into the screen, acting like he's in a trance. The same goes with the boat driving into the screen, SpongeBob's head is at the bow. The boat drives around the inside of another SpongeBob, while at a real-life road. Finally, a skull rises, SpongeBob's mouth is in its eye sockets. Its road-tongue rolls out, and SpongeBob skates out, wearing boats as rollerskates. He jumps off, spins, and falls. Cut back to Mrs. Puff in reality]
Mrs. Puff: Check...check...and...CHECK! [pants] What is this?! [pants]
[camera zooms to the only rule not checked off on Mrs. Puff's list: "Safely dock vessel"]
Mrs. Puff: Only one more test, and it's the easiest one yet. SpongeBob, all you have to do is safely dock this vessel.
[camera widens to show SpongeBob, still repeating the mantra. He is sweating and drooling, and his eyes are hypno-like]
SpongeBob: Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road. [crashes through a "road closed" sign] Focus... [snaps out] on the...road? What happened to the road!?
Mrs. Puff: Calm down, SpongeBob. Listen: all you have to do is safely stop this vessel!
SpongeBob: Uh...focus on the road, there is nothing but the road!
Mrs. Puff: Just stop the boat!
SpongeBob: Uh, focus on the - uh-uh-uh... [gasp] The road!
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, wait!
[SpongeBob sends the boat airborne; the boat lands on a plain of rocks]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBoooob!
[The boat hits a large rock; the boat lands on a road.]
SpongeBob: That was a close one Mrs. Puff. But I am back on the road and ready to focus upon it.
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob? This isn't just any road. [a truck honks two times] It's a 10-lane Intertial Seaway! [the truck honks again for 2 seconds]
SpongeBob: Shu-ven-tah-dil-in-chi-huh?!
Mrs. Puff: Stay calm, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob splats to the floor] SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! SpongeBob! Remember your mantra? 
SpongeBob: Right. "Focus on the road, there is nothing but the road" [SpongeBob gasps and the truck honks again] I can't even see the road! [SpongeBob shivers]. 
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob! Give me the wheel, SpongeBob. Oh, dear! He's completely frozen up! [Mrs. Puff rips off SpongeBob's hands and drives for him] Fiddlesticks!
[The truck honks longer and the boat passes by a police station]
Police Officer: Reckless drivers. I loathe reckless drivers. [the officer presses a button on the side of his helmet, making sunglasses (goggles) appear over his eyes, as well as a mustache between his nose and mouth, and then drives his motorcycle]
Police Officer: Pull over, you menace! [SpongeBob screams, Mrs. Puff is still driving with SpongeBob's arms]
SpongeBob: Uh, Mrs. Puff, can I have my arms back?
Police Officer: I said, stop your vessel!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Officer sir, I'm applying the brakes! [SpongeBob drives away]
Police Officer: Uh, we got us a runner.
Mrs. Puff: Pull over, SpongeBob... And make it quick. Look! [SpongeBob screams] No!
[Mrs. Puff screams in the tunnel]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, hit the brakes!
SpongeBob: Huh? Oh! Okay! [Car screams to a stop in a parking spot]
Mrs. Puff: Goodness gracious. There isn't a scratch on this vessel. SpongeBob? The test is history! You, you passed! Here's your license! [SpongeBob smiles and sheds a tear] And I'm free! Ha ha! [officer arrives]
Officer: I don't think so.
Mrs. Puff: Is there a problem, officer? [looks at her fin]
Officer: Well, you crossed the county line three miles back. You, ma'am, [puts handcuffs on Mrs. Puff] are a parole violator, which makes this test...null and void. I'll take that. [Officer rips up SpongeBob's license, Mrs. Puff gets thrown into police car]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I'll get you for this! I'll get you!


[The episode begins at Squidward's house where Squidward takes a really interesting meal he made out of the oven. He adds a bit of lemon juice on it and takes the meal to the table.]
Squidward: [French accent] I am a culinary genius, no? [sets his meal on the table where a wooden mannequin is sitting] Here you are, sir. Ze specialty of mah house. Roast salad à la Squidward. [gasps] Sacré bleu! I must apologize, monsieur! I have forgotten the parsley for the garnish. [takes his meal back into the oven] Stay warm, my little Squidy. [kisses it, but it burns his lips; he shrieks] Le oww! [closes the oven and goes outside to his garden] Typical, I always forget something.
[Squidward prepares to cut some of the parsley, but is pulled down by something.]
Squidward: Ugh!
[Squidward several attempts to pull the parsley out, but gets himself pulled into the ground. Underneath, he sees a sea bunny.]
Squidward: A sea bunny? [pulls parsley back]
[The sea bunny pulls Squidward's moustache off of his face.]
Squidward: [shrieks sharply] Ow!
[The sea bunny takes the moustache and ties it to his ukulele. He strums the ukulele and plays music while walking away in his tunnel.]
Squidward: [pulls himself out of the ground, retrieves his chef's hat, and puts it back on] That voracious vermin is ruining my French chef fantasy. [stomps on the ground and prepares to walk back in the house] Why—ah! [falls in the hole the sea bunny came out from]
[The sea bunny eats the parsley.]
Squidward: Grr! [tries to grab the sea bunny, but it pulls his hat down over his head; Squidward tries to take it off, but the sea bunny tickles him] Oh—oh, no, no, no, no! I have a ticklish core! [laughs]
[The sea bunny hops on top of Squidward and goes to ravage the garden. Suddenly, smoke comes out from the back door of his house.]
Squidward: Oh. [sniffs and opens his eyes]
[Squidward's house coughs up the smoke and fire breaks out. Squidward pulls himself out of the ground, grabs the hose, and rushes back in the house.]
Squidward: My roast à la Squidward!
[Squidward puts out the fire and carries his meal out. His roast à la Squidward is now burnt to a crisp and Squidward sighs. He sobs over his ruined creation. The sea bunny pops out of the hole and cries with Squidward.]
Squidward: What the—[growls as he goes to kill the sea bunny]
[The sea bunny grabs the burnt roast à la Squidward and shoves it in Squidward's mouth.]
Squidward: Oof! [gulps the burnt roast à la Squidward down and starts the feel sick]
[Squidward runs back in and the sea bunny hops back in his hole. The sea bunny continues to eat Squidward's vegetable garden as he dances to the music "The Blue Danube". He continues to enjoy himself until Squidward comes out, wearing a Viking outfit and holding a club.]
Squidward: I declare war on bunnies!
[Squidward runs to his garden and tries to strike the sea bunny with his club, but he ends up destroying his vegetables in the process. The sea bunny holds out a shield and protects himself from Squidward's club. The impact of the shield and the club causes it to get stuck on Squidward's face. Squidward pulls the club off his face and groans at his destroyed garden.]
Squidward: [growls and screams] I am going to bury that bunny! [falls in the hole again]
[The sea bunny giggles and belches. He buries Squidward in the soil and waters him with a watering can before walking away. Squidward then grows into a plant. Moments later, Patrick walks by and sees Squidward as a plant.]
Patrick: [gasps, climbs over the fence, and walks over towards Squidward] Wow. That's the ugliest eggplant I've ever seen! I don't think Squidward would mind if I took a little taste. Ooh, come here.
[Patrick grabs Squidward with his teeth and attempts to pull him off the stem. However, Squidward is completely stuck onto the stem, which causes Patrick to lose his grip and sends him falling into back under his rock. The scene changes to the sea bunny gathering more vegetables in Squidward's garden. He pulls out several vegetables and puts them in the basket. Suddenly, a really big carrot grows out of the ground. The sea bunny's buckteeth grow longer and sniffs it. The giant carrot, who is actually Squidward in disguise, pops out of the soil and runs away. The sea bunny begins to follow Squidward.]
Squidward: Ha, he's gonna fall right into my trap. [laughs]
[Squidward trips over a rock and gets caught in his own trap. The sea bunny begins knowing on Squidward's carrot costume.]
Squidward: [on the phone] Hello, Animal Control? I've got a sea bunny cornered in my garden and need assistance!
[The animal control officer pulls over with Patrick locked in the back. He exits the truck, grabs the sea bunny and puts him in a cage.]
Squidward: Did you have to catch him that easily?
SpongeBob: [handcuffs himself on the sea bunny's cage] I demand the release of this poor woodland creature. He's got rights too, you know.
Squidward: This is none of your business, SpongeBob, go away!
Animal Control Officer: You want him? You can keep him. [gives SpongeBob the cage] Save me a trip to the incinerator.
SpongeBob: Hooray! [giggles]
[SpongeBob pops out two rainbows and clouds from his head. The clouds fly under SpongeBob and form the word, "Happy!". SpongeBob floats away from Squidward's garden and flies into his house.]
Squidward: I'm warning you, SpongeBob. Keep that filthy animal away from my—[gets slammed in the face when SpongeBob kicks the front door closed]
SpongeBob: [opens the fridge and talks in sing-song] Vegetables! That's what you like, isn't it, bunny? We'll see what we got in the fridge.
[The sea bunny climbs out of the cage, sniff, and pants.]
SpongeBob: Whoops, I'm out of veggies. But I got something even better. [holds up Gary's food bowl] Gary's food! Yay! [the sea bunny sees how disgusting Gary's food is] Does bunny wunny like his dinny winny?
[The sea bunny throws the food bowl in SpongeBob's face. The bowl falls off and SpongeBob wipes the food off.]
SpongeBob: All right, Gary's food is out. Got it. I'll get you veggies. I'll be right back.
[SpongeBob forms himself into a egg-shaped rocket and blasts off out of his house. He flies over to the Barg'N-Mart to get vegetables. The sea bunny's stomach growls and begins looking around for food. He bites on the table and spits it out, breaking a flower pot in the process. He rips a hole on SpongeBob's chair and hops around, knocking over the shellphone. He opens the television screen, grabs some wires, and bites on them, electrocuting himself by accident. SpongeBob returns from the Barg'N-Mart with a bag of vegetables.]
SpongeBob: [sing-song] Bunny wunny! I've got a surprise for you—[screams when he sees the mess the sea bunny made]
[SpongeBob's teeth scream as well. The living room is a complete mess and the wires from the walls are sparking. The sea bunny goes into the bag and begins eating the vegetables.]
SpongeBob: I'm gonna have to chew-proof this whole house fast! [pulls out a bottle of hot sauce] Hot sauce ought to do the trick.
[SpongeBob squirts hot sauce on the couch and the shattered flower pot. The sea bunny sniffs the hot sauce and licks some. He belches out fire from his mouth and burns the flower pot. He giggles at this and hops for a bit. He goes to lick the hot sauce from the deflated chair. He belches fire at SpongeBob's  employee of the month photo and it burns. He goes to lick the hot sauce of SpongeBob's ribbons, trophy, books, and piggy bank as well as Gary's baby picture and toy ball. He belches fire on SpongeBob's stuff and burns everything. SpongeBob squirts hot sauce on Gary's shell and sees his living room on fire.]
SpongeBob: Huh? No, no, no, no!
[Thinking fast, SpongeBob takes a fire extinguisher and plugs it in his head. He absorbs the liquid from the extinguisher and spews it out all over the place to put out the fire. The sea bunny grabs the hot sauce bottle and drinks what's left of it. Suddenly, something bubbles in him and Gary backs away in panic. The sea bunny's face turns red and belches out a huge stream of fire.]
SpongeBob: My comic books!
[SpongeBob sprays water with the water gun to protect his Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy comic book collection from the fire. The sea bunny's mouth gets filled with water and he is cooled down.]
SpongeBob: I gotta get rid of all that hot sauce.
[SpongeBob licks up all of the hot sauce until everything is clean.]
SpongeBob: [turns red hot and screams as his tongue erupts like a volcano] Oh, oh, oh, oh! [dunks in the toilet and cools himself off]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob setting up a cage for the sea bunny to live in.]
SpongeBob: Here we are! Water supply—check. Trampoline for hopping—check. Buckteeth sharpener—check. And an adding machine for multiplying. [giggles] Triple check-aroonie! Now the bunny will be more than happy to stay in his cage. Huh? [pushes the cage to the sea bunny]
[The sea bunny sniffs the cage. He is not happy at the cage and shrieks. He kicks the cage at SpongeBob and pants wildly.]
SpongeBob: Doesn't like cage... [falls into pieces] Check.
[The sea bunny pants and growls. He climbs on the wall, rips a hole and crawls underneath the wallpaper.]
SpongeBob: No, no, bunny, don't go in there! You'll get lost! I need my jellyfishing net. Where did I put that thing? [runs to the sofa and digs his hand in the cushion] Probably dropped it in here somewhere. Nyah, nyah—ah, got it! [pulls out Patrick with the jellyfishing net on his head]
Patrick: Hello!
SpongeBob: Patrick, did you fall between the cushions again?
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, I fell between the cushions. [takes of the net] But I have a solution to your bunny problem. I love the hunt!
[Patrick rips a hole on the wall and crawls underneath the wallpaper to go after the sea bunny. But no matter where he goes, he knocks down everything off the wall.]
SpongeBob: [screams in panic as things drop off the wall] No, no! No, don't! Please don't! That's my—[part of the ceiling as well as the ceiling fan falls down] All right, Patrick, that's enough hunting. You can come out now.
Patrick: I can't see where I'm going. How do I get out of here? [screams in panic as he crawls to another wall] SpongeBob, where are I? [gets absorbed by the wallpaper]
SpongeBob: Stay where you are, Patrick! I've got an idea. To the pet shop!
[The screen changes into a map where SpongeBob, in video game character form, goes to the pet store to buys something.]
SpongeBob: Thank you! [goes back to his house with another sea bunny in a cage] Patrick! I bought a second bunny to lure the first bunny out of hiding.
Patrick: Hooray!
[SpongeBob gets up, opens the cage, and lets out a female sea bunny with a pink bow on it. The sea bunny notices the female, crawls to the ground and pops out from the floor. He investigates her and see becomes heads over heels with him. They two sea bunnies dance to a tango and SpongeBob plays music with the accordion. Patrick reappears from the wall.]
SpongeBob: Hold still, Patrick, I see you. [rips a hole to free Patrick]
Patrick: [gasps for air and sighs] Thanks, buddy. [the two sea bunnies hop by] Aww, bunnies!
[SpongeBob laughs as he follows the sea bunnies. Patrick comes out from the wall and follows as well. The two sea bunnies go into the bathroom and hop into the laundry basket. When SpongeBob and Patrick enter the bathroom, the two sea bunnies hop out of the basket.]
SpongeBob: One, two...[another sea bunny comes out] Three?
[It turns out the two sea bunnies multiplied in the laundry basket and a whole bunch of sea bunnies hop out.]
Patrick: More bunnies!
SpongeBob: [nervous laugh] Yay!
[The sea bunnies climb into the hole on the wall and crawl under the wallpaper.]
SpongeBob: Uh-oh. [he and Patrick grab jellyfishing nets] Patrick, the hunt is on! [he and Patrick do their war cry]
[SpongeBob and Patrick climb into the hole on the wall and crawl under the wallpaper as well. They chase after the sea bunnies from the bathroom, to the living downstairs, and then out the front door.]
SpongeBob: Hey! Come back, bunny wunnies!
[SpongeBob and Patrick chase after the sea bunnies all the way to Squidward's house. Squidward appears in a funeral attire and pays his final respects to his vegetable garden.]
Squidward: [French accent] This is the last carrot. [places the carrot next to the gravestone] C'est la vie. [the sea bunny pops out from the ground] One more step, and I will spit you on a roast! I mean, roast you on a spit! [the ground underneath rumbles and more sea bunnies appear] Oh, oh, what's happening?
[SpongeBob and Patrick appear from the ground.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah. We're here to help!
Squidward: They're growing! [shrieks and runs into his house]
[the sea bunnies crawl into Squidward's house. Squidward zips the door shut as sea bunnies crawl under the wallpaper. Squidward hides under the table and dials the shellphone.]
Squidward: Hello, Animal Control? Save me!!
[The sea bunnies emerge from the wallpaper and from one of Squidward's paintings. More sea bunnies emerge from the cabinets while others emerge from the electric outlet. Squidward blubbers in panic as sea bunnies invade his house. One sea bunny emerges from his nose. His entire house is flooded with sea bunnies. Squidward escapes from the upper window of his house. He gets up and groans like an old man. He shakes the sea bunnies off him and growls in anger. He grabs a mallet from the shed and spits on his hand.]
Squidward: Get out of my house! Gah! [hits his house with the mallet] That'll get them out.
[Squidward's house cracks and breaks into two halves. The sea bunnies form into his own house from underneath the wallpaper, much to Squidward's horror.]
SpongeBob: Sorry about your house, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah. We just heard.
[Squidward is overwhelmed with what he did and whacked himself on the head with the mallet. His head opens and his brain flies out. Squidward goes mentally insane and grows bunny ears, whiskers, a pair of buckteeth, and a fluffy tail. He then begins to hop like a sea bunny.]
Squidward: [maniacal laugh] I'm a bunny now! [crazy laugh] I'm a bunny now! I'm a bunny now!
Animal Control Officer: Okay, Mr. Tentacles, easy does it. [puts a straitjacket on Squidward]
[Squidward kicks the animal control officer in the face and runs away. The animal control officer gets up and goes after the mentally-crazed Squidward with the net.]
Squidward: [maniacal laugh] I'm a bunny now! [crazy laugh] I'm a bunny now!
[As the animal control officer chase after the crazy squid into the sunset, one sea bunny makes a face to look like Squidward. He mumbles like Squidward and plays "Shave and a Haircut" on the clarinet before closing the sea bunny window, ending the episode.]

 
[opening shot of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, love cookin' me some Krabby Patties! Feedin' all the children and the mommies and the daddies! Love servin' up the most delicious dish, but before I can, gotta add a little of this!♪ [takes tartar sauce bottle but it's empty] Hmm, time to refill the tartar sauce. [goes to a large tartar sauce bucket but it's empty] Empty! I thought I'd never see the day. "Use on or before the date printed below." [gasps] This can has been here for 50 years. That's longer than me! Oh, important Krusty Krab relic, what shall we do with ye?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, throw that trash out and get back to work!
SpongeBob: Trash? Oh, but, Mr. Krabs, this should be in a museum for future generations to enjoy.
Mr. Krabs: [gets an idea] Hmm. Future generations, huh?
[Bubble transition]
Mr. Krabs: Welcome to the Krusty Krab Time Capsule Spectacular! That's right! In 50 years, your donated treasures will be honored for future generations to enjoy! [to SpongeBob and Squidward] All right, you guys got donations covered, right?
SpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir!
Squidward: Whatever.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna go ahead and take care of souvenirs!
[Nat brings a toaster.]
SpongeBob: The peoples of the future must see this, so they will know how we toasted bread in the before time. So that they can understand the...
Squidward: Garbage. That'll be a $5 contribution fee. [SpongeBob puts the toaster in the time capsule]
Mr. Krabs: And there's your commemorative time capsule key chain. That'll be $49.57.
Billy: But, this thing's made out of rusty old paper clips and cardboard!
Mr. Krabs: All right. You drive a hard bargain. I'll throw in a coupon for one free ice cube in a purchase of any large cola at the Krusty Krab. What do ya say?
Billy: [takes coupon] Deal!
[Mr. Krabs puts the money away in his shell and sighs. Sadie brings a lamp.]
SpongeBob: What a beautiful lamp, ma'am, so ornate, essential for night time reading.
Sadie: Why, thank you, young man!
Squidward: No, thank you for completely failing our future generations with your donation. I mean, seriously, ma'am, did you just grab the first thing you saw this morning?
Sadie: Well, actually, I...
Squidward: [imitates Sadie] "Hmm. Oh, whatever shall I donate to the time capsule? Golly, this is hard! How about [gasps] this lamp?! It's [sarcastically] perfect!"
Sadie: Wow, you're good. How did you know all that? Are you like a psychic? Oh, oh, oh! Tell me what I'm thinking!
Squidward: Next. [throws the lamp]
SpongeBob: [catches the lamp in his face] Hey, nice pass, Squidward!
[Bubble transition; a strange man brings a plate.]
Squidward: Uh-huh. Tell me, what do you know about this plate?
Man: Uh, it works good when I eat stuff.
Squidward: Right. This plate is actually not meant to be eaten on. Now with your permission, I'd like to perform a few tests to verify its authenticity.
Man: Uh, okay.
Squidward: [starts teething on plate. Sucks it up his nose and takes it out] Uh-huh. [rubs it on his bottom] Interesting. [skids around on plate] This is a promising sign. Yep. [hits plate on man's head several times] You hear that plate-hitting-skull sound? It's definitely authentic. And I would price it conservatively in today's market at $250.
Man: Really?
Squidward: No. [throws plate away and SpongeBob catches it; he breaths heavily]
[Bubble transition]
SpongeBob: [to the plate] You are the crown jewel of the time capsule!
Squidward: Next. [throws sock]
SpongeBob: [gasps. He catches the sock and drops the plate, breaking it] A four-striped sock! Incredible!
French Narrator: 2 hours later...
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. I think that's everyone.
Patrick: [runs to the time capsule with a rock] SpongeBob! SpongeBob, did I make it? I brought my favorite rock to donate to the time thinger.
SpongeBob: Ooh, are you sure you can part with it, Patrick?
Patrick: Sometimes you've got to make sacrifices.
SpongeBob: After you then!
Patrick: Thank you, my good man.
Squidward: Sorry, Patrick, but there's no way I'm letting you put your dumb rock in the time capsule. I've allowed some seriously ridiculous items today, but this is where I draw the line. Do you unders...? [Patrick is gone]
Patrick: Okay, Rocky, you're going bye-bye now.
Squidward: Oh, no, you don't! [Squidward and Patrick fight over the rock and the rock falls on a wooden floorboard and it catapults SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward into the time capsule, which closes]
SpongeBob: You know, that didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would.
Patrick: What didn't? Hey, look, a yo-yo! [plays with yo-yo]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're very good at that!
[Bubble transition]
Mr. Krabs: And thanks so much for all your contributions! So are ya ready to put this thing in the ground?! [crowd cheers]
Plankton: Curse that Krabs and his cheering crowds! Big whoop-- a stupid time capsule. [blows raspberry]
Mr. Krabs: But, before we do, I'd like to make a contribution of my own. A copy of the Krabby Patty formula!
Plankton: [eye becomes bottle-shaped and antennae snap] There it is! The one element that can turn this lonesome bucket of steel into a bustling world famous eatery! [laughs evilly]
Mr. Krabs: [puts the formula in the time capsule] Send her down! [the time capsule gets buried]
SpongeBob: [throws a card in a net] He shoots, he scores!
Squidward: [shoves SpongeBob off] Get off me! [tries to get out]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, what are you doing?
Patrick: Yeah, it looks fun!
Squidward: WE JUST GOT BURIED ALIVE, YOU IDIOTS!
SpongeBob: I know, but what are you doing?
[Bubble Transition]
[everyone cheering]
Mr. Krabs: Who's ready to eat some Krabby Patties, 'cause all that waiting in line's got you super hungry? [crowd cheers. Everyone enters the Krusty Krab as Plankton laughs evilly]
[scene cuts to time capsule]
SpongeBob: Hmm. What should we do for the next 50 years?
Patrick: I'm just gonna hang here for a while, maybe get a kelp soda later.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you can't go anywhere. We're trapped down here till they open that capsule in 50 years.
Patrick: [shocked] 50 years? What are we gonna do till then?
SpongeBob: I don't know. We've got 50 years' worth of stuff to play with here! [finds a game. He gasps] It's our favorite game!
Both: Pretzel Pals!
Patrick: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! [lays the game out on Squidward]
SpongeBob: Yes, yes, now where did we leave off?
Patrick: I believe my left hand was on red.
SpongeBob: My right foot was on blue.
Patrick: Forehead on yellow.
SpongeBob: Left foot on green. [kicks Squidward in the face. He throws the game off him and on SpongeBob and Patrick
Squidward: That's it, this game is over! [SpongeBob and Patrick giggle]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what do you think Bikini Bottom will be like in the future?
SpongeBob: Hmmm. [SpongeBob imagines his future in a chrome area. He gets out of the time capsule]
Future Fish: Welcome to the future, history person. During your absence, our society has achieved numerous advances we're sure you'll find to be quite impressive. [he and SpongeBob get teleported to a water fountain] Well?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Wow, a water fountain for short people! What will the future think of next? [SpongeBob's future ends]
Patrick: Not bad, SpongeBob. Not bad. I dream of a town with a perfect blend of commerce and irrigation. [imagines his future in a real city] Not to mention the breathtaking views. [Patrick's future ends]
SpongeBob: Sounds dreamy, Pat. What do you think the future will be like, Squidward?
[Squidward imagines his future.]
Future Octopus: [holding up Squidward's painting of him] His art embodies the soul that our society has lost. And it is here, [the Krusty Krab is shown] the location of the suffering that inspired that art that we place the Squidward Tentacles Memorial Museum! [Squidward's house is dropped on top of the Krusty Krab replacing it with the museum; the other octopi cheer]
[scene transitions to the present with Squidward smiling]
SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?
Plankton: [uses his mining drill and burrows towards the time capsule] Jackpot! And now to extract the secret recipe. [the mining drill extends its arms, holding and wedge and hammer] Careful. Careful. [the hammer hits the wedge and Squidward gets knocked out]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Sixteen Bikini Bottom, nineteen Bikini Bottom, twenty! Ready or not, here we... [they both spot Squidward]
Patrick: Nice try, Squidward, but we both already got that hiding spot figured out. [finds a can of shaving gel] Whipped cream! [eats cream and spits it out] Oh, this whipped cream tastes awful! [reads off can] "Sha-veeng g-el."[a drill drills through and creates a hole in the can causing the shaving gel to land on Patrick's face] I've always wanted a beard!
SpongeBob: Me too! [both laugh as SpongeBob sprays shaving gel on his face] Do you want one too, Squidbeard? [sprays a beard on Squidward's face]
Squidward: [wakes up and moans] Wha...? Oh! Has it been 50 years already? [looks in the mirror and notices the beard] Yes! I knew I'd still be hot!
Plankton: [sneaks inside] Secret recipe, where are you? Aha! [jumps through the hole]
Squidward: Hello, future! [escapes through the hole Plankton made and digs up to the surface. He laughs] Yes! Huh? What the...?! Where's my museum? The future is the same as my old pathetic life! Forget this! I'm waiting another 50 years! [SpongeBob and Patrick watch as he stomps away]
Plankton: Finally, the Krabby Patty secret recipe! [laughs evilly]
Squidward: [stomps on Plankton, causing him to swallow the bottle] Dig me out when my life doesn't stink.
[Bubble transition to the Chum Bucket; Plankton is sitting on the toilet grunting.]
Karen: Don't hurt yourself, Poopsy.
Plankton: Quiet, Karen. Just bring me more prunes.


[The episode begins with SpongeBob once again trying to pass his boating test. SpongeBob is driving out of control.]
Mrs. Puff: Look out! Oh!
[SpongeBob hits the boat against the fence and the boat bounces back on the road. The boat swerves around in circles and a passing driver crash into the fence.]
Driver 1: Learn how to drive!
SpongeBob: I'm trying!
Mrs. Puff: Calm down, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff!
[SpongeBob comes up with an idea as a bottle of bubble soap appears above his head.]
SpongeBob: Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles! [blows lot of bubbles that covers the boat]
Mrs. Puff: No blowing bubbles while driving!
[SpongeBob's bubbles pops into the eyes of many drivers. SpongeBob's boat stops.]
Mrs. Puff: Phew! [sighs]
[The drivers appear out of the cloud of bubbles and crash into SpongeBob's boat, inflating Mrs. Puff in the process. SpongeBob laughs nervously as the drivers moan and groan in pain. Firefighters arrive to put out the fire.]
Driver 2: I can't feel my big toe.
SpongeBob: So, uh, how'd I do?
Mrs. Puff: [deflates herself] Get out! You're never getting a boating license!
SpongeBob: [whimpers as he goes to leave] But—but—
Mrs. Puff: [screams] Never! Never!
[SpongeBob curls up and sulks away. A piece of debris falls on Mrs. Puff's head, inflating her again.]
SpongeBob: I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership!
[SpongeBob notices Larry's boat at his gym.]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Ooh...
Tina Fran: It's really nice.
[The girls giggle.]
Larry: Oh, yeah, it's a turbo jet. 390 sea horse power with 11-to-1 pop-up piston. [chest revs like a racecar engine] We're talking some serious muscle!
[Larry turns on his boat and his engine roars.]
Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry! [hugs the tire]
[SpongeBob murmurs as he sees Larry's boat. He sulks off as the girls continue to admire Larry and his boat. SpongeBob continues to sulk back to his house until he sees Mr. Krabs washing his boat.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash! [wrings out his sponge] Isn't it?
[SpongeBob runs away, crying.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts.
[SpongeBob stops running and continues to cry. Then he notices Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out?
Patrick: Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now.
SpongeBob: Your boat. [shrinks] Sure, Patrick. See you later. [whimpers]
[Patrick hums as he takes out a flying disc.]
Patrick: Catch! [throws flying disc at the boat]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sulking behind his house. He blows a bubble version of Mrs. Puff.]
Bubble Mrs. Puff: You're a very good driver, SpongeBob, and my favorite student. Here's your license.
[The Bubble Mrs. Puff blows a bubble license and gives it to SpongeBob before she pops.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [bubble license pops] Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles. [sulks down; gasps] Oh! That's it!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob putting on some shades.]
Abigail Marge: Whoa!
Tom: What is that?
[SpongeBob appears to be driving in a bubble-shaped boat. As he drives it, everyone seems to take notice of it. He stops at a stoplight.]
Girls: Oh!
SpongeBob: All right, all right.
[SpongeBob bounces inside his bubble boat and makes it go faster. A boat in back of the girls' boat crashes at seeing SpongeBob's bubble boat. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by.]
SpongeBob: Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer?
Motorcycle Cop: Sir, I'm going to need to see your license for that, um...
SpongeBob: [laughs] You don't need a license to drive a bubble.
Motorcycle Cop: Hmm, I suppose you're right. Carry on, citizen.
[SpongeBob drives off with his bubble boat. The scene changes to SpongeBob coming home with his bubble boat. He enters his house and jumps in front of Gary, who is sleeping on his chair.]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Gary: [yowls]
SpongeBob: You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this!
[SpongeBob imitates his driving experience by floating around the house.]
SpongeBob: Then I made a right turn on red like this.
[SpongeBob imitates his right turn on red and floats around the living room. He lands on top of Gary.]
SpongeBob: You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true!
Gary: [grumbling] Meow.
[Gary goes back to sleep. SpongeBob hears a knock at the door.]
SpongeBob: Hmm?
[SpongeBob answers the door and sees various people.]
Green Fish: I'm here for a bubble boat.
Martin: Uh, yeah, me too!
Dave: I want one!
Various people: Uh, yeah, yeah, me too! Yes, please. One, please.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats.
Green Fish: Please?
SpongeBob: Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob carrying a large bottle-full of bubble soap for everyone to have bubble boats. He pushes the bottle into the tub and fills it with soap. He kicks the bottle away. The green fish grunts in excitement. SpongeBob takes out his bubble wand from his mouth.]
SpongeBob: One bubble boat coming right up!
[SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows the green fish a bubble boat.]
Green Fish: Thank you!
[The green fish drives off with his bubble boat.]
Plankton: Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I sure do, Plankton!
[SpongeBob dips his wand into the soap and blows Plankton a bubble boat that appears to be a killer robot. Plankton tries to get in, but he bounces off because the bubble is too big.]
Plankton: Oof!
[SpongeBob takes out a straw and sips the bubble boat down to Plankton's size. Plankton gets into his bubble boat.]
Plankton: Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets! [cackles]
[Plankton starts to drive his boat, but gets stepped on by Larry within seconds.
Plankton: Ouch!
[SpongeBob looks on, disgusted, as Larry raises his foot, unsticking Plankton from his foot. Plankton, squished into a blob, crawls away.]
Plankton: Strike fear...
Larry: Hmm...blow me something that screams Larry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I'm on it, Larry!
[SpongeBob pulls out a bigger wand, dips it in the soap, inhales and blows three huge bubbles until he shrivels. The three bubbles form into a bubble boat that has muscles like Larry.]
Larry: Now, this is what I call a muscle car!
[Larry jumps into his bubble boat as Tina drives by with her bubble boat.]
Tina Fran: I love your boat, Larry!
[Larry's bubble boat bulks up as they drive away. Just then, a huge line of people line up at SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo! [jumps into tub]
[SpongeBob absorbs the bubble soap and blows a huge amount of bubble boats for everyone. The crowd cheers. Meanwhile at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, Mrs. Puff is preparing for class.]
Mrs. Puff: [hums as she writes on the board] Greetings, class. My name is—[gasps]
[No one is there.]
Mrs. Puff: [startled stammer] Mrs. Puff. Oh, now that everyone's driving bubbles, they don't need licenses. [sighs] I guess there's just no place in this world for an old driving instructor.
[Mrs. Puff puts her apple in her apples box. She drives away from her Boating School and drives into the street.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Bah!
Fred: Hey, watch it, lady!
[Mrs. Puff swerves into a passing driver.]
Mrs. Puff: Ah!
Tom: I'm driving over here!
[Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.]
Mable: Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Mrs. Puff: Oh—wah!
[Mrs. Puff swerves into another passing driver.]
Clay: Hey! Pick a lane, butter-brain!
[A stoplight turns red as Mrs. Puff frantically tries to drive. As she drives, she runs through a stoplight, popping many bubble boats in the process. Just then, a motorcycle cop comes by on a bubble motorcycle.]
Motorcycle Cop: I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the boat, ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over?
Mrs. Puff: You ran my plates and saw my rap sheet?
Motorcycle Cop: What? No. Your vehicle has been outlawed, ma'am.
[A truck driver tolls Mrs. Puff's boat with his bubble truck, throwing out her apples in the process.]
Motorcycle Cop: Now that everyone drives bubble boats, real boats have been deemed too sharp and pointy to be street legal. [writes a ticket]
Mrs. Puff: But I've never driven a bubble!
[The motorcycle cop gives Mrs. Puff a ticket and leaves.]
Mrs. Puff: Bubble boating school?
[The scene changes to Mrs. Puff's Boating School now changed to Bubble Boating School. Mrs. Puff walks to the school, worried.]
Mrs. Puff: Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. [opens door] Please don't be SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob is seen at the desk.]
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [spins on the chair until he flies into the board] Hi, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Of course.
SpongeBob: You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P. [blows bubble] You'll be learning from a master.
[SpongeBob bounces his bubble around. He puts his foot on it and pops it, making him fall over.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [belches out bubble and laughs]
Mrs. Puff: Great.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the driving track in the bubble boat.]
SpongeBob: Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this.
[SpongeBob pumps his legs and makes the bubble boat move. He gives the steering wheel to Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff tries to do what SpongeBob did, but she loses her balance.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ooh! Oh!
[Mrs. Puff inflates herself inside the bubble boat.]
SpongeBob: Nice start.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff pumps her legs and manages to control the bubble boat. She makes a left turn from the wall and turns where the safety cones are. SpongeBob is writing down her scores. Mrs. Puff avoids prickly cactuses. However, she did not notice the cactuses that are on fire.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Fire!
[Mrs. Puff makes the bubble boat run through the burning cactuses and swerves it into the school's lighthouse. The lighthouse is set on fire and firemen arrive in their bubble firetruck to put out the fire. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at the starting line again. Mrs. Puff takes a deep breath and drives the bubble boat again. She goes over a hill, through a loop-de-loop hill, and drives past the flaming cactuses.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Ah! Hmm. Hah. Eeh.
[Mrs. Puff stops the bubble boat at the starting line.]
Mrs. Puff: I did it.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, you're ready.
Mrs. Puff: Really?
SpongeBob: Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there. [points to people driving in their bubble boats]
Mrs. Puff: [whimpering] Oh.
[Mrs. Puff drives the bubble boat out of the boating school.]
SpongeBob: Nice and easy. Doing great.
[Mrs. Puff continues driving.]
Harold: Hello!
[Mrs. Puff waves to Harold.]
Mrs. Puff: You know, this whole bubble boating thing isn't so bad. [laughs] Maybe I could—
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out!
[Mrs. Puff frantically panics now that she is on the freeway.]
SpongeBob: It's okay! Just calm down!
[Mrs. Puff swerves the bubble boat to the left.]
Mrs. Puff: Eeh! Oh!
[A passing driver makes Mrs. Puff's bubble boat spin around. The bubble boat hits two other drivers and bounces off into another street. Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob are driving in a one-way street and almost get hit by other drivers.]
Mrs. Puff: Ah!
[SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff move around in the bubble boat in panic.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
[Mrs. Puff's bubble boat hits Nathiel Waters' bubble boat.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! [inflates herself and pops her bubble boat]
[SpongeBob was sent flying into the ground. He pulls his head out of the sand.]
SpongeBob: Ah!
[Mrs. Puff's inflated body causes a pileup in the middle of the road. The bubble boats send Mrs. Puff and the other drivers flying to the surface.]
SpongeBob: Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface?
[The bubble boats reach the surface and they pop, sending everyone falling downward. SpongeBob quickly takes out his bubble soap and blows a lot of bubbles. SpongeBob's bubbles catches and saves everyone.]
SpongeBob: Doh!
[SpongeBob blows one last bubble to save Mrs. Puff.]
Mrs. Puff: [wipes the soap off] No more bubbles. Get them off me!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles? [laughs]
Motorcycle Cop: [takes bubble wand] Give me that! Bubble boats are too unstable. They've been declared illegal. Everyone back to your regular boats! [breaks the bubble wand and leaves]
SpongeBob: Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! ♪La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la♪
Mrs. Puff: [inflates herself] Oh, joy. [pops]

 
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Stop, thief! Come back here with me formula!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are chasing Plankton with the secret formula all over the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: He's over there! Stop him!
Plankton: [laughs] I can't help it. I'm a kleptomaniac!
[Mr. Krabs nearly catches him, but Plankton dodges him. Plankton keeps running away with the formula until he bumps into someone.]
Plankton: [laughs] Ow!
[Plankton pulls himself off, accidentally losing his eyeball and teeth. He puts his eyeball back in his face, looks up and sees a female police officer.]
Police Officer: You're under arrest!
Plankton: [puts his teeth back in his mouth] But I'm innocent!
Police Officer: No one is innocent! [cuffs up Plankton]
Plankton: Whoa. Things got dark fast.
Mr. Krabs: [giggles] ♪You're going to jail! You're going to jail!♪ Join in the dancing, boy, or you're fired. [SpongeBob joins in the dancing] ♪You're going to jail! You're going to jail! You're going to jail! You're going to jail!♪ [pokes Plankton]
Police Officer: Step back, buddy! Let the law handle this. [whacks Mr. Krabs' head with her club, inadvertently causing him to drop the secret formula]
Mr. Krabs: [dizzy] Yes, officer.
Police Officer: [takes the formula before Plankton can get it] And I'll be taking this!
Mr. Krabs: Wait! That's me secret formula!
Police Officer: [whacks Mr. Krabs' head with her club again] Well, now it's evidence. [picks up Plankton as he tries to get the formula] Oh.
Plankton: [gets whacked in the head by the officer] Ow!
[The police officer leaves the restaurant with Plankton and the secret formula.]
SpongeBob: The formula! I can't cook without that formula! [hyperventilates] I can't don't anything without it! The Krabby Patties are gonna taste like ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chum!
[The customers grumble and leave the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Don't go! We still have fresh buns. And we have air conditioning. Ohh... Come here! You and me are getting into that police department to get that formula back!
SpongeBob: How?
[Mr. Krabs puts on a police officer outfit.]
Mr. Krabs: By dressing like the po-po.
SpongeBob: The po-po? Oh, no, no.
Mr. Krabs: [removes SpongeBob's hat with the club] No, no po-po—no job-o for you-o. Comprendo?
SpongeBob: So-so. [gulps] But I'll go-go.
[Meanwhile, at the Bikini Bottom Police Department, Plankton is randomly getting pictures taken.]
Police Officer: Turn to your left. [takes picture and shows a mug]
Plankton: What is this?
Police Officer: Mug shot.
Plankton: [scoffs] Looks nothing like me. [gets drenched by the mug's coffee]
[The scene changes to the officer letting Plankton into his cell.]
Police Officer: [slams the door] Low life.
Plankton: You'd live a low life too, officer, if you were my height! [sighs and goes to sleep in his bed; he goes to tuck himself in, but sees that his blanket is a postage stamp] Could have given me a bigger blanket!
[The police officer put on donut-earmuffs so she wouldn't hear Plankton's complaining. Patrick comes in all covered in ice cream and looking drunk. Patrick kicks the camera stand and falls.]
Police Officer: One too many Goofy Goobers again, eh, Patrick?
Patrick: [gets up and groans] No, sir, I couldn't eat another.
[Patrick drunkenly stumbles over to Plankton's cell.]
Police Officer: Get in there and sleep it off.
[Patrick pulls the key out from his belly button and enters the cell. Patrick walks over to the toilet, runs over to Plankton and falls onto the bed to sleep. He turns his body over, revealing Plankton in his butt area.]
Plankton: Not exactly the blanket I wanted.
[Meanwhile in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are wondering around the streets in their police uniforms.]
SpongeBob: Isn't it a crime to impersonate a police officer?
Mr. Krabs: We're not impersonating, boy-o. I was in the navy, and the navy is sort of like the cops...of the sea. And I just deputized you. [whacks SpongeBob with the club]
SpongeBob: Deput—wow! I always wanted to be an officer of the law! Check it out. [rubs his chin] I'm the fuzz. Ooh, look at this! [takes off his shoe and his foot is flat] I'm also a flat foot! [giggles] Watch me work. [runs over to a passing mime and blows the whistle] Mr. Mime, you have the right to remain silent. [giggles and runs over to an old man] Stop or I'll shoot...you a nasty look. [makes faces, blows a raspberry, and giggles]
[SpongeBob starts holding hands with Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [pulls his hand away] Hey, let go! Cops don't hold hands.
SpongeBob: Well...they should. [droops]
Mr. Krabs: Bring it in, Officer Little Buddy!
[SpongeBob gets excited and hugs Mr. Krabs. Just then, a crowd of people is watching them.]
Mr. Krabs: What? Cops can hug. You know, boy-o, we probably make some pretty good cops.
[SpongeBob notices a little girl selling cookies at her cookie stand. He begins to grow suspicious.]
SpongeBob: Hm? Ohh. What have we got here? Excuse me, miss. Have you got a license to sell these cookies?
Mr. Krabs: Officer SquarePants, I don't think we ought to—
SpongeBob: Let me handle this, Officer Mr. Krabs! Well, missy, do ya?
Helen the Felon: I don't have a license.
SpongeBob: [cuffs the little girl] Yeah, that's what I thought. You're under arrest for violating penal code 4968973025-D.
Mr. Krabs: How did you know that?
SpongeBob: That's classified.
[Back in the Bikini Bottom Police Department, Patrick is having a conversation with Plankton in their prison cell.]
Patrick: Oh, I love it here. We have owers, uh, a courtyard, and three square meals a day. [holds up a bucket of raw chum] All chum...Ahh.
Plankton: I know. They're my only customer.
Patrick: [laughs and runs to the toilet] This is the best part! [flushes the toilet and it sprits out a fountain of water; he laughs] Pretty cool, huh?
Plankton: If you attempt to use that in front of me, I'll annihilate you.
[Outside the police department, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs bring the little girl to the front door.]
SpongeBob: Central booking, also known as the cop shop. [opens the door and lets the little girl go in]
Mr. Krabs: How do you know all these words?
SpongeBob: Still classified. [enters the building and Mr. Krabs follows]
Officer John Slugfish: Well, if it isn't little Helen the Felon. [drinks some coffee] Good work, boys. You nabbed the most notorious criminal in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Huh? This sweet little thing?
Officer John Slugfish: You can drop the act now, Helen.
[Helen bites SpongeBob's hand and kick's Mr. Krabs in the stomach.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey!
Officer John Slugfish: [chuckles] That's my girl. All right, take her to the interrogation room.
[Helen the Felon is taken to the interrogation room and SpongeBob turns on the light.]
Mr. Krabs: While I look for the formula, you can interrogate the suspect.
SpongeBob: But I don't know how to interrogate.
Mr. Krabs: Then just ask questions. [pushes SpongeBob in the room] And act tough. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Um...questions and act tough. Got it. [goes to the table and pulls the chair] Hmm... [sits down] Okay, little Helen! [inhales and buffs up his body] What do you think of this weather?
Helen the Felon: I think it's wuh-vey! Let me ask you something. How long have you been an idiot?
[SpongeBob begins to get nervous and shrinks down to his normal size.]
SpongeBob: I want a lawyer.
Helen the Felon: Just answer the question!
[SpongeBob's body rips in half, revealing his brain. SpongeBob takes his brain back and becomes even more nervous than usual.]
SpongeBob: [whimpers] An idiot? I don't know! Is it hot in here? [breathes heavily and sweats] Pressure—I can't—okay, I'll confess! I'll confess to it all! Anything! Whatever you got!
[Back at Plankton's prison cell, Plankton is sawing his way out with the nail filer. Patrick sighs behind him.]
Plankton: That's it. Keep up that cacophony. Your noise is drowning out my filing. [chuckles]
Patrick: [groans] My stomach needs frozen treats.
Patrick's stomach: Frozen treats.
Patrick: [jumps off the bed] Huh! I'm gonna have to make myself some jailhouse ice cream. [puts a band on his hand]
[Patrick grabs a bunch of toilet paper and stuffs them down the toilet. He pulls his underwear out and stuffs it in the toilet too. He squirts a tube of toothpaste, adds a cinderblock, and stuffs them all down with his foot. He grabs a scooper, scoops some green ice cream out and puts it on a cone made out of magazine. He takes a taste and he likes it.]
Patrick: Try it! You can't even tell the difference.
[A close-up of the ice cream is shown.]
Plankton: Blech! No, thanks. But, say, I know where they keep the real ice cream around here: in the evidence room. A guy like you who knows his way around here might be able—
Patrick: [pops a key out from the ice cream] I have a key.
Plankton: Oh, really? Let's go!
[Patrick swallows the key, rubs the ice cream all over his body and slips through the bars. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is searching through the hallway for the evidence room. He stumbles across a room filled with donuts.]
Mr. Krabs: Donuts? [opens the door and a pile of donuts fall on him] Whoa! [pops out] Hm. Well...maybe just one. [eats one donut; he turns and sees the door to the evidence room and spits the donut out] Evidence room! [goes to the door] Huh? [hears something]
Patrick: You promised me ice cream! Hmph! [sits on the floor and pouts]
Plankton: [jumps on Patrick's stomach] Look, once I get the secret formula and rule the world, I'll buy you all the ice cream you want! [hops over to a shelf filled with various evidence] Let's see. Comic books, sea shells...an old man...
Old Man Jenkins: Hello!
Plankton: Outboard motors...stolen jokes...a leg...
Fred: [off-screen] My leg!
Plankton: Hmm? Well, drop a dime on me! There it is! [goes to get the formula, but Mr. Krabs takes it before it gets it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, you don't!
Plankton: Krabs? What are you doing here? I stole that formula fair and square!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm stealing it back! [stuffs the formula under his shirt]
Plankton: Oh, no, you not!
[Plankton throws a sea shell at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs removes the shell and falls over, knocking over boxes of evidence. He comes out, holding an old man.]
Old Man Jenkins: Hello!
[Mr. Krabs throws the old man at Plankton, squishing him in the wall.]
Old Man Jenkins: Hello!
[Plankton throws the old man back at Mr. Krabs, sending him flying into another shelf. A group of old people fall onto Mr. Krabs.]
Old people: Hello!
Mr. Krabs: Who's been pinching all these geezers?
Patrick: [grabs Mr. Krabs] Where's my ice cream? Where's my ice cream? Where—[hallucinates as he sees Mr. Krabs' eyestalks become two ice cream cones; he gasps] Ohh! Well, there it is. [licks Mr. Krabs' eyestalk]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, you maniac?! Help! Police! [screams as he runs]
[Plankton jumps onto Mr. Krabs and begins a brawl.]
Mr. Krabs: What do you think you're—
[Moments later, Officer John Slugfish comes in the evidence room, eating a donut. He sees Plankton, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick fighting.]
Officer John Slugfish: I don't know what you two are doing, but it looks illegal. [gets caught in the brawl, but manages to cuff them all up]
SpongeBob: [comes in wearing cuffs] I have a confession to make!
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob being placed in the same cell with Plankton and Helen the Felon.]
Officer John Slugfish: I'll just hold onto this formula till the morning. [shuts the cell door]
SpongeBob: Oh, but, officer, I have more confessions.
Officer John Slugfish: Zip it, kid! I get it. You're a criminal mastermind. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Guilty! Yay!
Plankton: Hey, where's Patrick?
[They see Patrick, covered in ice cream again, all drunk from Goofy Goobers and opens the cell door with the key. Patrick walks over to the toilet, runs over to Plankton, Helen the Felon, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob and falls onto the bed to sleep.]
SpongeBob: Well, I must confess, this is sure cozy.


Narrator: [Camera cuts to the exterior of The Krusty Krab] Closing time at the Krusty Krab. 
Mr. Krabs: [Counting the change in the cash register] 51, 52, 53... 
Squidward: [Counting his suction cups] 29, 30, 31... 
SpongeBob: [Mopping in synchronization] One, two, three. One, two, three. 
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, can we please go now? 
Mr. Krabs: Perhaps, one of our more loyal workers can enlighten you on company policy. 
SpongeBob: [Referencing the manual] "The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for." 
Squidward: But that's not fair! 
SpongeBob: [Referencing the manual, again] "Clause 3b: The proprietor reserves the right to be unfair." 
Squidward: Teacher's pet. 
Mr. Krabs: Let's see... [counts money in register] five, ten, 25, blue, apple sauce. Everything looks to be in order. Except... [gasps] Where is it? [takes apart the register in search of something] Where is it? 
Squidward: What? 
Mr. Krabs: My dime! Me special dime, the first dime I ever made! I always keep it in the back of the register for luck! 
Squidward: Well, I've never seen it! [Mr. Krabs glares at Squidward in suspicion] 
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, are you prepared to say that with your hand on a stack of Interpretive Dance Quarterlys!? [pulls out a stack of dance quarterlies] 
Squidward: Of course I'm... [makes a shocked face] What are you saying? 
Mr. Krabs: Me? I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test! [holding a lie detector in his hands] 
Squidward: You're saying something! 
Mr. Krabs: Heavens to Betsy, no. It's just that me lucky dime's gone missin', and you've been working the register all day! 
Squidward: Are you accusing me of something? 
Mr. Krabs: Well, the way I see it, there are three possibilities: One, you stole it. Two, you stole it? Or three — YOU STOLE IT!!! 
Squidward: [enraged] I didn't take your precious dime! 
Mr. Krabs: Show me your tentacles! 
Squidward: What?! 
Mr. Krabs: I wanna see empty suction cups! 
Squidward: [squeezes Mr. Krabs' eyes with his tentacles in anger] Here! Here! Here! See 'em?! [stomps away] 
Mr. Krabs: You... you can't do that to me! I'm your boss! 
Squidward: Not anymore, Mr. Krabs! I QUIT! [throws his hat down. The hat falls in slow motion] 
SpongeBob: [gasps] No. [catches the hat with a pillow] Whew. 
Squidward: I'm outta here! 
SpongeBob: Squidward, you're making a big mistake! 
Squidward: Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab! 
SpongeBob: But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy! And what could be better than serving up smiles? [smiles really big] 
Squidward: Being dead, or anything else. 
SpongeBob: I never knew you felt so strongly about it. 
Squidward: Where have you been? 
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter. [Norma appears with cookies on a silver platter and offers SpongeBob a cookie] 
Norma Rechid: Free sample? 
SpongeBob: Cookies! [Takes one, and eats it] 
Squidward: Can I have one-? [Norma is already gone] 
SpongeBob: Anyways, I just want you to know. If you ever get in trouble, come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me... [grabs Squidward and pulls him toward himself] ...we're like brothers. Only closer. [lifts Squidward's shirt and their hearts are somehow joined together and beating in unison. Creepy music plays before Squidward leaps away from SpongeBob.] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to. [imagines himself in various following jobs] I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman. 
SpongeBob: Or a football playing king in space... with a mustache. 
Squidward: [narrows his eyes] Yeah... uh-huh. Ya know, that reminds me, there's been something I've been wanting to say to you since the day we met... goodbye. Next time you see me, this town will be eating out of the palm of my hands! [skips to a homeless Squidward in a box trying to get spare change in a cup from passersby] Spare change? Spare change, ma'am? 
SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward, is that you? 
Squidward: Uh, I, uh... [closes his box] 
SpongeBob: It's me, SpongeBob. [opens his box up] We used to work together. 
Squidward: SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob: There ya go. So, where you living these days? 
Fish: Squidward Tentacles? 
Squidward: Yes? 
Fish: Sign here, please. [Squidward signs and the fish takes his box] 
Squidward: Uh... nowhere. 
SpongeBob: Great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No, wait, let me guess! Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell... you're a football player? 
Squidward: No. 
SpongeBob: A spaceman? 
Squidward: No! 
SpongeBob: A football playing king in space- 
Squidward: Don't you get it?! [sobs] I'M A LOSE-E-ER! I've lost my job, my home, EVERYTHING! 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Even your paintings!? 
Squidward: Nobody would take them, so I had to eat them! [his stomach is shown to have a rectangular shape from his eaten painting. Squidward starts to cry out a fountain of tears into SpongeBob. SpongeBob soaks it up and becomes bigger, but he squishes himself to let the water out] 
SpongeBob: There, there. You can come live with me. [shown at SpongeBob's house] Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed. [Squidward is laying in SpongeBob's bed] 
Squidward: Okay, but just until I get a job. One day... two days tops. 
SpongeBob: [baby talk] Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to. [kisses Squidward on his nose] Good night, my little angel. [the next morning, SpongeBob rings a bell to wake Squidward] Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you. 
Squidward: And in bed, too? Aw, thanks, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I... 
SpongeBob: Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane. [makes plane noises while attempting to put some food in Squidward's mouth with a spoon] 
Squidward: It's really nice of you to help me in my time of need. [swallows the food] I'll try not to be a burden. 
SpongeBob: It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, winner? 
Squidward: No, no, no. You've already... well... [shows SpongeBob putting lotion on his hand and then massaging Squidward's scalp, feeding him grapes, massaging his tentacle, spraying his scalp with hairspray and wiping it, massaging his back then his nose, giving him a baby bottle, wiping his scalp once more, giving him an acupuncture, and polishing his head and seeing his reflection] 
SpongeBob: Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. [throws the blanket upwards and it lands on him as he lies on the sofa] I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good. [turns the lamp off then yawns] Good night, Gary. 
Squidward: SpongeBob, can I get a glass of water? [bottom floor light turns on and SpongeBob marches up stairs and turns on the light to give Squidward the water] Thank you. 
SpongeBob: Good night. [marches back down stairs and turns off the light] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, could I get some more blankets? [SpongeBob marches upstairs again turning on the lights on the way up there] 
SpongeBob: Here you go. 
Squidward: Thank you. [SpongeBob goes downstairs again, accidentally leaving Squidward's light on] SpongeBob, you forgot to turn out the light! [SpongeBob marches upstairs] 
SpongeBob: Good night. [turns off light and when he walks downstairs he trips and makes lots of noises] 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me. 
Narrator: Three weeks later... 
SpongeBob: [exhausted] He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back. [falls down] 
Narrator: Many months later... 
SpongeBob: [even more exhausted. Gary looks tired as well] I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough. [falls down] 
New Narrator: So much later that the old narrator got tired of waiting and they had to hire a new one. 
[SpongeBob drags himself into the room, by now utterly exhausted. Gary doesn't look sympathetic, though.] 
Gary: Meow, meow, meow. 
SpongeBob: [annoyed] I KNOW HE STILL ISN'T LOOKING FOR WORK! DON'T RUB IT IN!!
Squidward: SpongeBob, where's my lemonade? 
SpongeBob: Coming, Squidward... [He falls flat on his face] 
Squidward: [SpongeBob is running down the hallway] SPONGEBOB?! SPONGEBOB?! [SpongeBob enters his bedroom] And why aren't you in uniform? [SpongeBob exits room and re-enters in a maid outfit] It's about time you got here! 
SpongeBob: [sardonically] Here you go, Your Majesty. 
Squidward: I can't drink that. 
SpongeBob: Why not? 
Squidward: Are you blind? Just look at it. [close-up of the lemonade] 
SpongeBob: [becomes irritated] What about it? 
Squidward: That lemon has three seeds in it. That's an odd number! I can't eat anything odd numbered. 
SpongeBob: Fine, I'll just take it out. [takes out lemon and Squidward gets mad] 
Squidward: No! No! IT'S ALREADY CONTAMINATED BY THE BAD LEMON! It won't work. 
SpongeBob: Hmmm... that's two things in this house that won't work. 
Squidward: Then go fix them. 
SpongeBob: [grips the glass of lemonade so hard that it shatters] Two things that won't work! [clenches his fists in anger] 
Squidward: I've changed my mind. I want soup instead. 
SpongeBob: Okay. Don't move. [walks out the bedroom door, revealing his white briefs. He then closes the door, and comes back in wearing normal clothes with a bowl of steaming soup] Here you go. It's alphabet soup. I made it special. [shows soup with the phrase "GET A JOB" in alphabet letters but then Squidward slaps it out of SpongeBob's hands] 
Squidward: Condensed soup from a can? Disgusting. Now you've ruined my appetite. Go fetch me something to read! 
SpongeBob: Oh, okay. How about this? [pulls out a newspaper with the "job listings" page on the front] 
Squidward: [gasps and swats the newspaper away. SpongeBob becomes more angry] GET THAT AWAY FROM ME. You know I'm allergic to newsprint! 
SpongeBob: Haha, ya know, when you swatted that newspaper out of my hands, it reminded me of something a friend of mine did... at his JOB! [SpongeBob's alarm blows him away] 
Squidward: 4:00. Time for my stories. Hurry up, they won't hold the show while you laze around. [SpongeBob rolls in a TV and hands Squidward the remote. Squidward turns it on to see two puppets: one green puppet and one lime green puppet wearing a shirt and tie] 
Puppet #1: [puppet #2 is whistling] Hey, where ya goin'? 
Puppet #2: To my job! 
Puppet #1: You have a job? 
Puppet #2: Why wouldn't I!? I'm not some lazy, inconsiderate jerk who lays in bed all day! 
Puppet #1: Say, where can I get one of these... jobs? 
Puppet #2: Oh, they're everywhere! [we see SpongeBob playing with the puppets] Especially if you're green and have six tentacles! 
Puppet #1: Thanks. I'm gonna go look for one so I can stop... 
SpongeBob: ...mooching off my friends and they can get back to their lives! 
Squidward: This isn't my show. [presses the remote, but nothing happens] SpongeBob, the remote control is broken! Get over here and fix it! 
SpongeBob: I've got a better idea! [throws the TV away and jumps on top of Squidward in bed] Why don't I call someone whose JOB it is to fix it!? You know why?! Because when I need a JOB [pokes Squidward's nose] done, I get someone with a JOB [pokes Squidward's nose] TO DO [pokes Squidward's nose] THAT JOB!! [pokes Squidward's nose for the fourth time] 
Squidward: [narrows his eyelids] ...What are you saying? 
[This turns out to be the last straw. Outside, it is day. SpongeBob's house jumps into the air before the side is smashed out as an enraged SpongeBob pushes the bed, with Squidward still in it, outside and towards the Krusty Krab while screaming in extreme and total fury.] 
Mr. Krabs: [talking on his phone] Donate to the children's fund? Why?! What have children ever done for me? [SpongeBob grabs the phone and throws it away] 
SpongeBob: You want your dime back?! [takes one out] TAKE IT!!! Now Squidward can come back, right? [Mr. Krabs checks the dime through a telescope] 
Mr. Krabs: Wrong. [throws the dime at SpongeBob's face] That ain't my first dime. 
SpongeBob: Then have some more dimes! [throws out more dimes at Mr. Krabs' face. Mr. Krabs narrows his eyes] I've got plenty of 'em! 
Mr. Krabs: You can't put a price on me first dime. And I can't forgive that thieving bilge rat Squidward for stealing it!
SpongeBob: [finally snapping in extreme rage, he grabs Mr. Krabs by the throat and holds him up in the air] LISTEN, YOU CRUSTACEOUS CHEAPSKATE! SQUIDWARD'S BEEN LIVING AT MY HOUSE, DRIVING ME CRAZY! [shakes him vigorously] AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HIRE HIM BACK ALL BECAUSE OF A STUPID DIME?! [a prehistoric dime falls out of Mr. Krabs' back pocket. SpongeBob suddenly calms down and lets go of Mr. Krabs] What's that?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Me first dime! [hugs the dime] Oh, Dimey, I'll never lose you again! 
SpongeBob: This is a dime? 
Mr. Krabs: I've been in business a long time, boy. 
SpongeBob: So, if Squidward never stole the dime, he can come back to work, right? 
Mr. Krabs: Aye, lad, just let the dime and me have our privacy. [kisses the dime. SpongeBob cheers before running off] 
Mr. Krabs: [at the counter] Well, Mr. Squidward, it's good to have ya back. 
Squidward: Well, it's kind of good to be back, sir. 
Mr. Krabs: It's all water under the bridge now. 
Squidward: I agree, sir. 
Mr. Krabs: After all, I'm sure ya didn't mean to misplace me dime. 
Squidward: What the... what are you saying? 
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's obvious that ya put the dime in me pants. Dimes just don't fly into people's pants. 
Squidward: Are you accusing me of something? [SpongeBob puts the maid costume back on over his clothes] 
Mr. Krabs: Well, the way I see it, there are three possibilities: One, you put the dime in me pants. [outside the Krusty Krab] Two, you put the dime in me pants? OR THREE — YOU PUT THE DIME IN ME PANTS!!!!!

 
[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick taking a nature hike in the Kelp Forest.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this grass feels great between my toes. Hey, Patrick, are you enjoying our early morning nature hike?
[Patrick yawns, falls over and drags himself over to SpongeBob. He gets up with grass all over his body.]
Patrick: It's cutting into my early morning nature nap. [falls over and shakes the grass off]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. If you want to stay healthy, you have to embrace nature!
Patrick: Okay!
[SpongeBob and Patrick skip happily into an ice cave.]
Both: Ooh!
SpongeBob: Cool ice cave!
Patrick: Ohhhhhhh... [walks over to a block of ice] This whole place is a frozen treat! [licks the ice]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! Don't lick the ice, you're gonna get stuck!
Patrick: Uh. Now he tells me. [cries and struggles to free himself]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. Everything is going to be fine. Just don't panic.
[Patrick screams in panic and wraps his tongue around a stalagmite. However, his tongue pulls him back and he slams into the ice.]
Patrick: I panicked, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob digs into his backpack and pulls out a cup of hot chocolate.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry! Hot chocolate solves everything.
[SpongeBob pours hot chocolate on Patrick's tongue, burning it.]
Patrick: [screams and pulls his tongue off the ice] Hot! Hot! Hot! [grabs a rock and smashes his tongue] Hot! Agh! [sighs]
[Patrick's tongue is now burnt and bruised. Patrick faints and falls asleep. SpongeBob puts his hot chocolate in his backpack. But unbeknownst to him, the hot chocolate completely melts the ice, revealing a cave sponge from within. The cave sponge wakes up and emerges from the ice.]
Spongy Spongy: Uh...?
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. That's enough nature for you today.
[SpongeBob pulls out his shoes from his backpack and puts them on. He does a little warm up with his feet and shoes. The cave sponge is sniffing around and takes notice of SpongeBob's shoes. He immediately becomes fascinated by the squeaking noises SpongeBob's shoes make.]
Spongy Spongy: Oh? Ah. [purring] Squeaky, squeaky!
[SpongeBob grabs Patrick's tongue and drags the sleeping Patrick out of the ice cave. The cave sponge starts following SpongeBob and stows away into his backpack.]
Spongy Spongy: [purrs] Mehh.
[SpongeBob drags Patrick to his house and ties his tongue on a rack like a horse.]
SpongeBob: See ya later, Patrick. [leaves Patrick and enters his own house] Gary, I'm home! [takes off his backpack and hangs it on the coat hanger] Boy, this backpack got heavy.
[SpongeBob leaves. The coat hanger bends over and breaks.]
Gary: Meow!
[The cave sponge climbs out of SpongeBob's backpack and sniffs around.]
Gary: Meow.
[The cave sponge sniffs Gary and sees SpongeBob walking with his squeaking shoes.]
Spongy Spongy: Ah!
[The cave sponge follows SpongeBob upstairs to the bathroom where SpongeBob is taking a shower. He sneaks into the bathroom and hides in the sink. SpongeBob, who is now wearing a bathrobe and shower cap, walks up to the sink and sticks his tongue out. The cave sponge sticks his tongue out as well, but his tongue has hair on it.]
SpongeBob: Boy, those nature hikes really put hair on my tongue.
[The cave sponge climbs out of the sink and follows SpongeBob to his clothe-changing machine. SpongeBob activates the machine with his nose and it removes his shower cap and bathrobe. It then dresses SpongeBob in his regular pants and shoes and gives him his Krusty Krab working hat. SpongeBob leaves and the cave sponge pulls the button off the wall, causing the machine to go haywire. The machine removes the cave sponge's loincloth and dresses him in SpongeBob's pants.]
Spongy Spongy: Agh-agh-agh!
[The machine goes to put SpongeBob's shoes on the cave sponge's feet.]
Spongy Spongy: [panting] Squeaky! Squeaky! [happy grunts]
[The machine puts the shoes on the cave sponge's feet, but they were too small and they both rip through.]
Spongy Spongy: [groans] No squeaky.
[The machine gives the cave sponge the Krusty Krab working hat and the cave sponge leaves.]
SpongeBob: I'm on my way to work, Gary. See ya tonight! [leaves]
[The cave sponge imitates SpongeBob's words in grunts and walks through the wall.]
Gary: Meow?
[The cave sponge follows SpongeBob all over town and still fascinated by the squeaky shoes.]
Spongy Spongy: [happy chuckling] Squeaky! Squeaky! [happy grunts]
[The cave sponge waves his arms back and forth as he follows SpongeBob. However, in doing so, he accidentally destroys a mailbox.]
SpongeBob: [hums and picks up a stick] Ah! [drags the stick against the fence]
[The cave sponge attempts to imitate SpongeBob's tactic. However, he ends up destroying the fence. SpongeBob swings on a nearby fountain. The cave sponge does the same thing, but ends up destroying the fountain. The cave sponge follows SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: It was. [gets punched in the face by the cave sponge] Agh! [falls backwards]
[SpongeBob and the cave sponge enter the kitchen. The cave sponge goes to sniff around while SpongeBob prepares to make relish.]
SpongeBob: I do relish... [pulls out a jar of pickles] making the relish!
[SpongeBob pours pickles in the blender. Then he pours vinegar and grease in the blender and begins mixing them together. The cave sponge is frightened by the blender and hides himself behind several pots and pans  above the condiment table.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [louder] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?! You called me?
Mr. Krabs: Can you step into the dining room for one moment, son?
SpongeBob: [jumps out of the kitchen] Huah! Wha-wha-wha-wha-huah! Front and center, and ready for duty, sir! [gasps as he sees the Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant with Ivy and his smashed-up mailbox]
Ivy: That's the man who smashed my mailbox, officer!
Mr. Krabs: Well?
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs, I'd never do something like that!
Mr. Krabs: Of course you wouldn't! It's just this loser's word against yours, boy-o. They can't convict you for that.
SpongeBob: Phew.
Evelyn: He ruined my fountain!
Cara: Yeah, yeah! That's the guy!
Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant: Mr. SquarePants, I'm afraid you're under arrest. [cuffs SpongeBob and drags him out of the restaurant]
SpongeBob: But—but, Mr. Krabs, I didn't do anything. I was framed! It wasn't me! [screams]
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, boy-o! I'm right behind you! [kicks Squidward's cashier boat] Look alive, Mr. Squidward! [Squidward gets up] I'm gonna visit SpongeBob in the big house. You are manning the grill! [grabs Squidward and shoves him through the kitchen window]
Squidward: [yelling] Ow! [grumbles as he gets up and puts his hat on]
[The cave sponge observes Squidward as he begins flipping a Krabby Patty.]
Spongy Spongy: Ah? [growls] Agh! [takes a bite of the patty and falls on top of Squidward with the pots and pans]
Squidward: They let you out already? Ugh, you look terrible, SpongeBob! [the cave sponge groans] Well, get the food ready. It's almost time for lunch! [leaves]
Spongy Spongy: Food? [chuckles]
[The cave sponge grabs a spatula and a mop and make them into a spear. He jumps in the air and lets out a war cry.]
Spongy Spongy: Agh! [stabs the ketchup bottle with his spear and gets ketchup on his face; he grunts]
[The cave sponge smears ketchup on his left eye as if he is making his mark. The scene changes to the cave sponge hiding behind some garbage cans behind the Krusty Krab. He sees Frankie billy pulling up to the restaurant with his boat. The cave sponge jumps out and lets out a war cry. He jumps on the boat stabs it with his spear, rips open the hood, pulls out the motor, and drinks the oil. He lets out a victory yell and runs back in the restaurant with the motor. Frankie Billy, who is stunned at what he saw, locks the passenger door. The cave sponge places the motor on the grill, puts buns on it and smashes it into pieces with his club. He makes a sandwich and just as he goes to take a bite, Squidward takes it.]
Squidward: Well, it's about time! [takes the motor parts and goes to serve the "food" to the customers]
[Fred goes to bite his sandwich, but his teeth shatter. Abigail takes a bite of her sandwich, but burns her tongue. Gus takes a bite of his sandwich, but chokes on a tire. He spits out the tire and it hits Tom in the face, leaving him marks. The customers are angry and begin a riot against Squidward.]
Customers: This is ridiculous! Is this a restaurant or a garage?
[The customers grab Squidward and throw him into the kitchen.]
Spongy Spongy: Huh?
Squidward: SpongeBob, what did you do? The patties taste horrible! Everybody hates them!
Spongy Spongy: Unh... [growls and pulls out his club]
Squidward: What the— [screams in panic and runs out of the kitchen] SpongeBob's gone crazy! Run for your lives!
Spongy Spongy: [grunts] Spongy! Spongy! [growls as he smashes the tables]
[The customers run out and scream in panic. The cave sponge whacks Nat Peterson's buttocks with his club and goes on a violent rampage across town, causing all sorts of damage in the process.]
Perch Perkins: This is Perch Perkins live at the Krusty Krab, where we understand that a local fry cook has just gone nuts.
[The cave sponge smashes the Krusty Krab sign with his club. The sign falls on top of the restaurant, causing damage to it.]
Perch Perkins: [gets whacked in the head by the cave sponge] Ooh! This just in... Ow!
[Meanwhile, at Bikini Bottom Jail, Mr. Krabs goes to visit SpongeBob. SpongeBob picks up the phone to talk to Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Why did you have to go nuts on company time, boy-o? I'm gonna lose so much money.
SpongeBob: I didn't go nuts, Mr. Krabs. They must've mistaken me for someone else. I'm innocent! [taps his squeaky shoe]
[Outside the prison, the cave sponge hears SpongeBob's squeaky shoes.]
Spongy Spongy: Oh? Squeaky, squeaky? [growls as he smashes the fence with his club]
Mr. Krabs: Save it for the judge, boy-o. Come clean! Nobody else even looks like you!
[Suddenly, the cave sponge bursts through the wall with his club, crushing the Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant in the process.]
Mr. Krabs: Except that guy.
[The cave sponge wonders around, jumps on the counter and smashes the window, crushing Mr. Krabs underneath. Officer Rob Johnson comes in and is cornered by the cave sponge.]
Spongy Spongy: [growls] Squeaky, squeaky! Squeaky, squeaky!
Perch Perkins: Local scientists now believe that the rampaging fry cook is actually a prehistoric "cave sponge," once thought to be extinct.
Officer Rob Johnson: Ah! Get him off!
SpongeBob: See? I didn't destroy any property! It was that cave sponge!
[The cave sponge drags Officer Rob Johnson, sniffs him, and licks his head.]
SpongeBob: Aw. He's just lost and scared. He just needs another sponge to talk to.
[The cave sponge runs away.]
Perch Perkins: Shortly thereafter, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob went to City Hall to confront the wild beast.
Mr. Krabs: We did?
[The scene changes to the police officers and the Bikini Bottomites cornering the cave sponge at City Hall. The cave sponge throws a chuck of the roof to the police officers.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, officer. I'm a fellow sponge. He'll listen to me.
[SpongeBob catapults himself in the air and tackles the cave sponge to the top of the roof.]
Spongy Spongy: Unh? [sniffs]
SpongeBob: Ooh? [giggles and sniffs] SpongeBob. SpongeBob! [gives the cave sponge a light punch on the chest]
Spongy Spongy: Unh. Spongy Spongy. [punches SpongeBob in the face]
SpongeBob: Oof! Now we're getting somewhere! Sooo...can you please go downstairs now and turn yourself in to the police?
[Spongy Spongy walks to the edge, looks down and sees the police.]
Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant: Hello!
[Spongy Spongy growls in confusion.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Spongy Spongy, I respect that. I'll leave you alone. [walks away]
Spongy Spongy: [growls] Uh. [happily grunts and follows SpongeBob] Oh! Squeaky, squeaky!
[SpongeBob realizes that Spongy Spongy likes the squeaky sounds his shoes make.]
SpongeBob: Oh, you like that, huh? [squeaks his shoes] Ah!
[Spongy Spongy imitates his movements. As SpongeBob and Spongy Spongy start to dance, the Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant pulls out two canes and hats and throws them up to them. The two sponges, past and present, put on a show on the rooftop and dance the night away. The police officer dance along as well. During the show, Spongy Spongy continues to imitate SpongeBob's dancing movements. SpongeBob's shoes come off and Spongy Spongy's feet come off and they both dance as well. The two sponges finish the show and everyone on the ground gives them a round of applause. Spongy Spongy swipes SpongeBob's shoes and goes to try them on. However, since his feet are too big and the shoes are too small, he growls in frustration and stomps on the roof.]
SpongeBob: Spongy Spongy, wait! Wahh!
[But it was too late. The City Hall's roof cracks and the building collapses to the ground. The police and Mr. Krabs walk up to SpongeBob and Spongy Spongy.]
SpongeBob: Well, I talked him down. Hooray. Oh, please don't put Spongy Spongy in jail!
Bikini Bottom Police Sergeant: Nobody's gonna put him in jail son. He just saved the town millions by demolishing City Hall. It was due to come down next week.
SpongeBob: Ah! Spongy Spongy is free!
Spongy Spongy: [grunts as he walks around upside down with SpongeBob's shoes in his hands] Spongy Spongy. Spongy Spongy!
Perch Perkins: And so, the savage beast finally soothed, life in Bikini Bottom returns to normal...if only for this episode. This is Perch Perkins—[gets whacked in the head by Spongy Spongy's club] Ow! [groans] For Bikini Bottom News.
[Spongy Spongy looks at the camera, sniffs it and smashes it with his club, leaving a crack on the screen. The camera falls over and Spongy Spongy looks at it, ending the episode.]

 
SpongeBob: ♪ Workin' at the Krusty Krab! Workin' at the Krusty Krab! La, la, la, la! Loo...♪ Squidward? Squidward? [snaps fingers four times] Squidward, are you okay?
Squidward: Hm? Oh! I couldn't be better!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! It happened again, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about?
SpongeBob: It's Squidward!
Squidward: [smiling and staring into the distance]
SpongeBob: What is it about the third Wednesday of every month that makes Squidward so happy?
Mysterious man: Psst. Squidward?
Squidward: Roger! Is that you?
Mysterious man: Tonight's the big night!
Squidward: [Gasp!]
[A few hours pass. It is night now.]
SpongeBob: These camouflage outfits should help us find out what Squidward's secret Wednesday secret is!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling]
Squidward: [walks out of his house]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [dive into kelp. When Squidward walks away, they follow him]
Squidward: [sitting at bus stop. The bus arrives, and Squidward gets in]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hiding under Squidward's bus seat]
[The bus arrives at a strange, pyramid-shaped building. Squidward gets off the bus.]
Squidward: Hello, Brother Roger.
Squidward and Brother Roger: [do secret hand-shake]
Brother Roger: Come right in, Brother Squidward.
Squidward: Thank you.
Lodge members: [talking]
Squidward: Ah. This almost makes the other three hundred and fifty-three days worth living for.
Lodge leader: For centuries, cephalapods have had but one nemesis. Let he among you who wishes to join the lodge face your greatest fear. Cantankerous Moray Eelius!
Lodge members: [Gasp!]
Cantankerous Moray Eelius: Huh?
New lodge member: [shivering while walking up to the moray eel's cage]
Squidward: I'll never forget my initiation ceremony.
New lodge member: [shivering]
Cantankerous Moray Eelius: [stings new lodge member]
Lodge members: [cheering]
Brother Roger: [puts lodge hat on new lodge member]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [clapping]
SpongeBob: Yeah! Way to go!
Patrick: Way to go!
Lodge members: [Gasp!]
Lodge leader: [Gasp!]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [clapping]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Patrick! Did you follow me here?
Lodge leader: Brother Squidward! For thousands of years, no outsiders have witnessed this sacred initiation. You have desecrated the sanctity of this lodge!
Squidward: But...but, I..I...I....
Squidward and SpongeBob: [get kicked out of lodge]
Squidward: I can't believe it. They kicked me out of the Cephalopod Lodge.
SpongeBob: Do we get to join the lodge?
Squidward: Were you dropped on your head when you were a baby?
SpongeBob: Huh! How did you know?
Squidward: Psychic powers. Hey! Where's Patrick?
SpongeBob: Maybe he got to join the lodge!
Patrick: [falls out of the sky and crushes Squidward]
SpongeBob: Or... maybe not. They didn't let you join either?
Patrick: Nah. I found the institution had nothing of to offer me. I was stagnating.
SpongeBob: Hey, where's Squidward?
Patrick: Hold on. [shakes right leg. Nothing happens. shakes left leg]
Squidward: [head pops out of Patrick's shorts]
Patrick: Found Squidward. [pulls Squidward out of his shorts. Then, pulls the hat out and puts it on Squidward's head]
Squidward: The last thing in my life I really enjoyed. And SpongeBob ruined it, too.
Patrick: Well, at least you still have the hat.
Squidward: Yeah. [sniffles] I do, don't I?
Brother Roger: Eh, hem. [takes Squidward's hat]
SpongeBob: You still have your robes.
Brother Roger: [takes Squidward's robes]
Patrick: You still have your underwear.
Brother Roger: [takes Squidward's underwear]
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: [covers his own eyes and Patrick's]
Squidward: [pulls on his regular shirt] You can look now.
SpongeBob: Don't you worry, Squidward. I'm sure if Patrick and I just explain what happened, they're sure to let you back in.
[knocks on Cephalopod Lodge door]
Brother Roger: What is it? Oh, it’s you two.
SpongeBob: We just came to explain that Squidward had no idea that we followed him to the lodge. So, it's not his fault.
Patrick: Yeah. Not his fault.
Brother Roger: Then who's fault was it?
Patrick: Was it my fault?
SpongeBob: No, it wasn't your fault, Patrick.
Patrick: Thanks, SpongeBob. And it wasn't your fault either.
Brother Roger: Well, if it wasn't your fault, and it wasn't Squidward's fault, who's fault was it?
Patrick: Uh...maybe it's your fault.
Brother Roger: Squidward is never allowed in this lodge again!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Are they letting me back in the lodge?!
SpongeBob: No. You can't set foot in the lodge.
Patrick: Ever!
Squidward: [sniffles and tears up] Oh. Now that you two have ruined the last good thing in my life,...I think I'll go slam my head in the door. Repeatedly.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait! I'm sorry we got you kicked out of your lodge. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Squidward: No. Why didn't you just make up your own dumb club instead of ruining mine?
SpongeBob: That's it! [jumps on Squidward] Squidward! We'll make our own club! And it'll be so much better than that dumb old Cephalop-olaphapa Lodge! And you can be our leader! How great does that sound, O Mighty One?! Wanna join our club, Patrick?
Patrick: Dog-pile on Squidward!
Squidward: Aaahhhh! [The three walk back home].
SpongeBob: Squidward, you're the lodge expert. What do we do first?
Squidward: Say good-bye. [enters his house]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Good-bye!
Squidward: Morons.
SpongeBob: [climbs in through Squidward's window] So anyway, Squidward, I was thinking we should be working on our secret lodge initiation.
Patrick: [falls through Squidward's window] Hey.
SpongeBob: Patrick and I have come up with a secret hand-shake.
Patrick: Secret!
SpongeBob: [claps hands over head]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Patty-cake, patty-cake, sailor man! Bake me a cake as fast...
Squidward: SpongeBob! That's not a secret hand-shake! Everybody knows Patty-cake!
SpongeBob: Not the way we do it.
Patrick: We don't use our pinkies.
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out of his house] Out!
Patrick: I don't think Squidward wants to join our lodge.
SpongeBob: Oh, sure he does. He just needs a little push. [knocks on Squidward's door]
Squidward: Oh, what now? I'm coming! What do you... Great. Must be one of SpongeBob's pranks.
SpongeBob: [traps Squidward in a light brown bag] Let's move. [SpongeBob and Patrick carry the bag away]
[They arrive at Jellyfish Fields.]
SpongeBob: Okay, we can let him out now.
Squidward: Are you insane? You kidnapped me?
SpongeBob: Oh, we didn't kidnap you. We just brought you here for...
Patrick: Initiation.
Squidward: What? What kind of initiation?
SpongeBob: A very special initiation. [pulls a jellyfish out of his net]
Squidward: Oh, boy. Look at the time! Gotta run.
Patrick: [smashes Squidward to the ground]
SpongeBob: Would you care to go first, Brother Patrick?
Patrick: After you, Brother SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [flicks the jellyfish and puts it on his tongue] Ow! Ooo, ooo! Ow! [gibberish] Brother Patrick.
Patrick: Brother SpongeBob. [slaps the jellyfish and puts it on his tongue] Aaahhhh! [gibberish] Brother Squidward. [pulls Squidward's tongue and puts the jellyfish on it]
Squidward: [jumps into the air] Eee-aahhhhhhh!
[The next morning, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are all back at home.]
Unknown person: [knocks on Squidward's door]
Squidward: What's this? Can it be? My lodge robes! I'm back in the lodge! I gotta try 'em on! [He comes out of his room, dressed in a chicken suit] Huh? This can't be right! These aren't my cephalopod robes!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling. They are in chicken suits, too]
SpongeBob: They sure aren't. They're your uniform for your new lodge! Welcome to the first official meeting of...The Feather Friends.
Squidward: Feather Friends?
SpongeBob: Somebody already had Feather Buddies.
Patrick: Yeah. Those Feather Buddies better hope they don't run into us in a dark alley.
Squidward: Grrrr. [rips his chicken suit in half] I don't want to be a Feather Buddy!
SpongeBob: Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend?
Squidward: Grrr...no.
SpongeBob: Aw...Squidward, I hadn't realized how special your lodge was to you. I'll get you back in that club. And I know just how to do it. [takes off his chicken suit] Everything we need is in this drawer. [pulls Squidward's sock out of the drawer]
Squidward: A sock?
SpongeBob: Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll half to let you back in the lodge!
Patrick: Hm. It's genius. But, I see one flaw in your plan.
Squidward: One flaw?
Patrick: That sock is way too small.
SpongeBob: It is. Time to break out the heavy artillery. [grabs a giant sock]
Patrick: That's what I'm talkin' about!
[It is night time at the Cephalopod Lodge.]
Albino eel (SpongeBob): Okay, Squidward. Just give us five minutes and then do your stuff.
Albino eel (SpongeBob and Patrick): [walk to the lodge]
Squidward: Huh.
Narrator: 5 minutes later.......
Squidward: [walks to the lodge] This is ridiculous, No one is dumb enough to believe SpongeBob and Patrick are a..a....giant albino eel!
Lodge members: [screaming and running]
Patrick: Roooo!
SpongeBob: Roar!
Lodge members: [screaming and running]
Patrick: Roo!
SpongeBob: Roar!
Squidward: Unbelievable.
Lodge member: Squidward!
Brother Roger: Look out!
Lodge member: There's a giant albino eel on the loose!
Squidward: [clears throat] Do not worry. I will save you. Be gone, foul beast, or, I will smite thee. [punches the sock twice]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh! Oh, ow! Ow! Oof! [sock flattens and collapses]
Lodge members: [cheering] Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: [laughing]
Brother Roger: [gives Squidward his hat and robes]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [cheering]
SpongeBob: Way to go, Squidward.
Patrick: It works!
Squidward: [nervously] Whoa!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward get kicked out of the lodge.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. We still have the Feather Friends.
Patrick: But you'll have to pass the initiation again.
Squidward: Aaah! No!
[Patrick grabs Squidward's tongue, so Squidward faces the screen. Fade out and we hear a sting. Squidward screams really loudly, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is reading a catalog with his snail, Gary.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, take a look a this, Gare Bear. Found a slime ball in your shoe? Even purebred snails call fall victim to the scourge of slime balls. [puts the catalog on the table and flips his glasses in his head]
[Gary hacks and spits out a slime ball. SpongeBob catches the slime ball with a catcher's mitt.]
SpongeBob: You really got some air on that one.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I know that meow. That says, "I'm hungry." [flips his chair over to reveal Gary's food bowl] Lucky for you, I speak fluent snail. [sticks out a can of snail food from his mouth and dumps some food in Gary's bowl]
Gary: [pouts] Meow!
SpongeBob: What, you're not hungry?
Gary: [kicks the food bowl in SpongeBob's face] Meow-meow!
SpongeBob: [whips the food off with his nose] Oh, of course. [opens his face and pulls out a leash] You wanna go for a walk? [closes his face] Gary, you really need to work on your pronunciation.
[SpongeBob goes to put the leash on Gary. But Gary backs away. SpongeBob tries again, but fails. Then the two start a brawl, which ended with SpongeBob getting tangled in the leash.]
SpongeBob: Okay, no walkies. [pulls the leash off]
[Gary angrily meows at SpongeBob and pushes him against the table. The catalog falls off the table.]
SpongeBob: Oh, if only you could talk like a real person. [Gary points at something in the catalog] Huh? Ooh! [reads] "The chatterbox translation collar? Know what your best friend is saying!" A snail translator! That's a great idea, Gary. [picks up the phone and calls the chatterbox salesman]
Chatterbox salesperson: [filing her nails] Chatterbox order line.
SpongeBob: Hello, yes, could you please send me one chatterbox snail collar?
Chatterbox salesperson: Do you want regular, express, or our fastest delivery option time warp?
SpongeBob: Ooh, time warp, please!
Chatterbox salesperson: Very well, your package was delivered last Thursday.
[SpongeBob hangs up the phone, turns around, and gasps as he sees a huge box in the middle of the floor.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I wonder where this came from.
[Gary slithers off the box and SpongeBob opens it. He dumps out the styrofoam, which is formed into a cube. He touches it and styrofoam explodes in his face. SpongeBob inhales the styrofoam and holds up the new translation collar.]
SpongeBob: Oh, here we go. [puts the collar on Gary's shell] Okay, Gary, speak to me.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Check, check. [Gary meows] One, two. Ah, that's more like it. Hello, there, Papa Bob.
SpongeBob: [tears up] Papa Bob. Oh! Oh, Gary, now you can express you innermost thoughts in language I can understand. [holds up diary] I have so many questions.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Lay 'em on me, Papa Bob.
SpongeBob: What do you dream about?
[As Gary explains, he is shown flying in the sky with jellyfish.]
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Mostly, I dream of flying above it all...
SpongeBob: Aww, that's sweet.
Gary's collar: While I breathe fiery destruction upon my enemies.
[Gary breathes fire on the town of Bikini Bottom and the townspeople scream and run in terror. The vision ends and SpongeBob gets very scared.]
SpongeBob: [gulps] Hey, if you're gonna dream, dream big, right? [clears throat] Let's move on to question two, shall we? What are your long-term goals?
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] To finish restoring my hotrod.
[Gary's hotrod is shown sputtering and firing up its engines. One tail pipe falls off.]
SpongeBob: Yeah, you need to get on that. But what I really want to know is, [turns upside-down and shakes his butt] how do I look in these pants?
[Gary's eyes look squared until he shakes his head.]
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] They really bring out the sharp corners of your buttocks.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you flatterer. Come on, Gare, let's show Patrick your new voice. [meets up with Patrick outside] Oh, Patrick, I have got a surprise for you! [laughs] Say hello to Gary.
Patrick: [shakes Gary's eyestalk] Hello, Gary.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Hello, stinky man.
Patrick: Hmm? Hmm. [smells his really stinky armpit and his head melts] Phew! Ooh, you're right, Gary, I am ripe! [grabs a trashcan and dumps garbage onto himself] Ah, much better.
Gary's collar: [Gary sniffs and meows] Delightfully disgusting.
Patrick: Thank you, my good man.
[The scene changes to Sandy leaving the Bikini Bottom Dentist Office.]
Sandy: Thanks for the old tooth scrubbing! Bye!
SpongeBob: Sandy! Gary has a new translating collar.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Hello, hairy astronaut lady.
Sandy: How do you do, little fella? [pets Gary]
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] You know, same shell, different day.
SpongeBob: Isn't it amazing?
Sandy: Aww, that ain't nothing. I invented a nut translator ages ago. [puts a nut translator on a walnut]
Walnut: [through nut translator] The pistachios are all out to get me. You can't trust 'em. They're working for the peanut mafia!
Sandy: [laughs] Walnuts are extra nutty.
[The scene changes to Squidward meditating in his house.]
Squidward: Om.
Master Marty: [on television] In order to achieve complete brainfulness, one must clear one's mind of all distractions.
[The doorbell rings.]
Master Marty: [on television] Distractions are only in your mind.
[The doorbell continues to ring and Squidward grumbles.]
Master Marty: [on television] You are the center of the universe.
[The doorbell rings again.]
Squidward: Center of the universe.
[The doorbell continues to ring and Squidward grumbles.]
Master Marty: [pops out of the TV] Will you answer the door already?!
[SpongeBob continues to ring the doorbell until Squidward answers.]
SpongeBob: I think your doorbell's broken, Squidward.
Squidward: What do you want?
SpongeBob: I thought you might want to chat with your neighbor.
Squidward: Why would I want to talk to you?
SpongeBob: Oh, not to me. [holds up Gary] To Gary.
Squidward: Oh, good grief. SpongeBob, Gary can't talk. He's a snail!
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Greetings and salutations, grouchy man.
Squidward: Wha-ha?
SpongeBob: I bought Gary the new pet translator collar.
Squidward: Why would you want to talk to him?
SpongeBob: Who wouldn't want to talk to their pet?
Squidward: I was talking to Gary.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows and enters Squidward's house] Oh. Those walls! That carpet.
SpongeBob: Turns out Gary has a very sophisticated sense of design.
Squidward: Really? [slams the door in SpongeBob's face] Well, maybe I'll give him a guided tour.
[SpongeBob flips himself over to the other side of the door and falls into Squidward's floor.]
SpongeBob: Hey, wait up!
[Squidward leads Gary upstairs in his painting gallery.]
Squidward: And up here, you'll find my true masterworks. Hidden away from the eyes of the undeserving public.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Ah, the naïve cephalopod style. Not very sophisticated.
Squidward: Huh? [grumbles as his face turns red] See here.
[Gary looks through Squidward's closet and SpongeBob takes notes on Gary's thoughts.]
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Ugh! Tacky.
Squidward: Hold on now!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward, I'm taking notes for you. [Squidward whacks the notebook out of SpongeBob's hand]
Master Marty: [on television] Fell the plainfulness flow through you.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] You watch this nonsense?
Squidward: What? What's wrong with it?
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Nothing, I'm sure. Apparently, no brain required. Come, Papa Bob. Let's get out of here before this bad taste rubs off on us.
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, gee, do you have to?
SpongeBob: Don't be sad, Squidward, we'll be back soon.
[SpongeBob and Gary head out the door and Squidward grumbles in anger.]
Master Marty: [on television] Until next time, remember to free yourself from all distraction. [vanishes]
Squidward: [grins evilly] Oh, I will. [snickers]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob getting ready for bed.]
SpongeBob: [yawns] Night, Gare Bear.
Gary's collar: [Gary meows] Good night, Papa Bob.
[SpongeBob claps his hands and the lights turn off. As SpongeBob and Gary sleep, Squidward is on the ceiling watching from above.]
Squidward: Good night. [slides down the wall with his suction cups and sneaks up on a sleeping Gary] Now, let's see if SpongeBob still wants you to talk after tonight. [steals the translator collar, takes out a fake one with a walkie-talkie on it, and slips it on to Gary's shell]
[Squidward snickers evilly and exits SpongeBob's room through the window. As he gets to the ground, he steps on a rake and gets smacked in the face with it.]
Squidward: [screams and pulls the rake off his face] Stupid rake! [speaks through walkie-talkie] Oh, Papa Bob. [clears throat] No, no, no. [clears throat and talks in a snooty voice] Oh, Papa Bob. [Gary's still sleeping] I'm thirsty.
SpongeBob: [moans] At this hour? All right, I'll get you some water. [slides off his bed and rolls to the bathroom; then comes back with a glass of water] Here you go, buddy, one water. [places it in Gary's bowl and prepares to go back to bed]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] I want to go to the park.
SpongeBob: Huh? Oh, sure. No problem, Gary. [yelps as he tries to stay awake]
[SpongeBob falls over, puts Gary on his back and slithers to the front door. Moments later, SpongeBob and Gary, still half-asleep, comes back from their walk.]
SpongeBob: Well, that was fun. [puts Gary in his bed and prepares himself to go to sleep]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] My bed is too lumpy.
SpongeBob: All right, then. [slips off his bed again and picks up Gary] Here, Gary, take my bed, hmm? [puts Gary on his bed and goes to sleep on the floor]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] Papa Bob, it's hot in here. [snickers]
[SpongeBob opens his bedroom window.]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] Still too stuffy.
SpongeBob: Still too— [takes out a sledge hammer and pounds a hole on the wall; the wind blows in] How's that, Gary?
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] The view is so much nicer a block away.
SpongeBob: Okay, okay.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob lifting his house up with a jackscrew and putting wheels on it.]
SpongeBob: This should get things rolling. [kicks the jackscrew out from under the house and pushes it out onto the road]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] Keep going. Just a little more. [snickers and looks through binoculars] Perfect.
[SpongeBob stops on a hill and is completely exhausted.]
SpongeBob: [gasps as he sees a comet flying across the sky] You're right, Gary. The view is nicer over here. Gary? [sees his house rolling down the hill] Gary! [screams]
[SpongeBob's house rolls down into Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob chases after his house and clings onto the lower window. He opens his front door and climbs back inside. The house rolls down the road and runs through a red light, which also causes pile-ups. The house crashes into several buildings. SpongeBob screams as he sees danger signs about a steep cliff the house is heading to. SpongeBob jumps out through the hole and slows the house down with his shoes.]
SpongeBob: [his shoes ignite and burn, making him barefooted] Whoa! [screams] Oh-whoa-oh! Look out! Look out! [whimpers as he clings onto his house]
[The house stops slowly and dangles over the cliff. SpongeBob clings onto the front wheel and pulls himself to safety on the cliff.]
SpongeBob: Whew! Aww, that was close, huh, Gary? [he accidentally leans onto his house and it rolls off the cliff] Oops.
[SpongeBob's house rolls far out into the distance. The scene changes to the next morning. SpongeBob and Gary are deeply upset that their house is gone, leaving them nothing but a dirt circle on the ground.]
SpongeBob: Aww, now where are we gonna sleep? [sobs]
[Squidward snicks as he pulls up a brick wall.]
Squidward: [through walkie-talkie] You could always live in a hole, like that idiot sea star.
[As SpongeBob continues to cry, Gary discovers the fake collar on his shell. He looks around.]
Gary: Meow?
[Gary discovers Squidward laughing to himself behind the wall, holding a walkie-talkie. He glares at Squidward and sees a sobbing SpongeBob digging a hole. At that instant, Gary realizes that  Squidward is responsible for the loss of SpongeBob's house and growls angrily at him. Gary decides to teach Squidward a lesson and slithers over to him. As Squidward continues to laugh, Gary pulls to fake collar back and launches it into Squidward's mouth, making him choke on it and then swallow it. Gary then meows through the walkie-talkie to make Squidward sound like a snail. SpongeBob digs deeper in the hole as his house suddenly appears above him and rolls back into place. The house falls on SpongeBob and he comes out through the door.]
SpongeBob: My house! Oh, Squidward, we're neighbors again. [hugs Squidward]
Squidward: [pulls SpongeBob off] Get off of—
Gary: [through walkie-talkie] Meow.
[Squidward covers his mouth.]
SpongeBob: Uh, I didn't catch that, Squidward, what'd you say?
Squidward: I said, "Get off of"—
Gary: [through walkie-talkie] Meow.
[Gary continues to meow through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body until it attracts the attention of a pedestrian with his worm. The worm growls, barks and runs over to Squidward.]
Nat Peterson: Hey!
[Squidward becomes scared and runs away as Gary meows through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body.]
Nat Peterson: Hey! Come back with my worm!
[Squidward runs into the pet park with several angry worms following after him. As Gary continues to meow through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body, Squidward gets himself cornered by the worms. Gary hisses through the walkie-talkie in Squidward's body. All of the worms pile up on Squidward and begin to maul on him.]
SpongeBob: Aww, looks like Squidward wants a pet of his own to talk to.
Gary: [smooth voice] Meow. [laughs and smiles]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The customers are crowding in front of the little window. Bubble Bass is sitting on Squidward and Squidward struggles to free himself from the bottom.]
Squidward: [grunts as he tries to free himself] You people are proof that evolution can go in reverse!
Customers: Shh!
[The customers watch as SpongeBob juggles the Krabby Patties and roll them onto the grill. Three patties remain spinning until SpongeBob "shoots" them flat like shooting a gun.]
Customers: Ooh! Ahh!
[SpongeBob sprays ketchup and mustard on the buns. He bangs on the grill and sends the patties flying. Then he makes six perfect Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[The customers applaud for SpongeBob's talented performance.]
Bubble Bass: Ooh, impressive! That's most impressive!
[Mr. Krabs comes in.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, why aren't these walking wallets spending money?
Squidward: [grunts and talks muffled] Because they're too busy watching SpongeBob cook!
Mr. Krabs: What? [climbs onto Squidward]
Squidward: [gets stepped on by Mr. Krabs] Ow!
[Mr. Krabs climbs onto the customers and take a peak in the kitchen. SpongeBob is spraying ketchup and mustard on the buns.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm. Well, he's not exactly maximerizing his worktime with those flourishes. But, boy, does that boy-o have talent. [his eyes become light bulbs with dollar signs on them; he turns them on with his nose] Ding! [climbs down and grabs a mallet] And talent equals money!
[The customers turn and run as they see Mr. Krabs preparing to smash a hole in the wall. Squidward screams and runs away as well. Mr. Krabs smashes the wall really hard and makes a massive hole between the kitchen and the dining room. SpongeBob finishes his juggling act and turns around. He becomes startled to see the massive hole Mr. Krabs made.]
SpongeBob: I have X-ray vision! I can see through walls!
Mr. Krabs: Calm your waters, lad. I just knocked it down.
SpongeBob: [jibbers] Why'd you do that?
Mr. Krabs: In the restaurant business, it's called an open kitchen so the customers can watch the cook cook.
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I don't think I can take that kind of pressure.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense. You're a born performer. [looks around and sees a closet] Ooh! [carries SpongeBob to the closet] Here. [takes out a pen, opens it, and draws a star on it] You even got your own dressing room. See? Huh? Huh?
[A Krabby Patty falls from the shelf. SpongeBob runs in and locks the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? Uh... [jiggles the doorknob] Come on, boy-o, it's showtime!
SpongeBob: [whimpers as he looks through the mop on his head] I can't! I've got stage fright!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, if you don't come out, you're fired!
[SpongeBob reluctantly comes out of the closet and feels nervous.]
Mr. Krabs: There he is! [flicks SpongeBob's hat off and gives him a toque] ChefBob! [grabs SpongeBob and closes the closet with his foot] Me little star! [pushes SpongeBob to the grill] Break a leg. Break two legs.
Fred: [holds up his leg] My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Shut up, Fred! [makes his leave] Ta-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
[The customers cheer. SpongeBob is really nervous and unsure about this open kitchen business. He grabs a patty and he wipes the sweat off his head.]
Customers: Ooh!
[SpongeBob puts the patty onto the grill, but accidentally burns it. He grabs a bun filled with mustard and puts the burnt patty on it. He puts his shoe and a bar of soap on the patty. SpongeBob presents it and the customers seem confused.]
Harold Reginald: What?
[Now Mr. Krabs is getting a little nervous, but keeps his cool by smiling.]
Fred: That's just wrong!
[SpongeBob grabs a tube of toothpaste and smears it on the patty. The customers are still confused.]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, boy-o! Razzle-dazzle them!
[SpongeBob hides under the grill trying to think of a solution to his stage fright problem.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what do I do? What do I do? [sees a paper bag] Huh? Oh!
[SpongeBob grabs the bag and makes it into a small little puppet version of himself, ChefBob. He slowly shows the puppet to the customers and Mr. Krabs. The customers are amazed at it.]
ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
[The customers shrug in confusion. The couldn't figure out how to respond to it. One customer was gnawing on his hand.]
Dave: I guess I am.
ChefBob: Welcome, welcome to my job in the kitchen of ChefBob! I cook and dance, I wear square pants, cooking for this hungry mob! [singsong] Your order, please!
[The customers cheer and SpongeBob is happy.]
Mr. Krabs: [rubs his claws together] The little ChefBob is a sensation.
[The scene changes to all of the customers gathering around to see the ChefBob show Mr. Krabs put up. ChefBob comes out from the curtain.]
ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
Customers: We are!
[ChefBob grabs some patties and juggles them. and roll them onto the grill. Three patties remain spinning until SpongeBob "shoots" them flat like shooting a gun just like how SpongeBob did earlier. SpongeBob grins happily at ChefBob's performance. ChefBob flips three patties and grabs one with a whip. He gives the patty to a cowboy and stamps a picture of himself with a branding iron.]
ChefBob: Huh?
[The scene changes to ChefBob playing magic tricks with the patties. He pulls a patty from Jennifer Millie and Clay's ears.]
ChefBob: Ha, ho! Ha, ho! Voilà!
[ChefBob throws the patties on the grill after they bounced onto Squidward's nose.]
ChefBob: Ta-da!
[The customers cheer.]
Clay: [looks at his watch] Oh-ho! Look at the time. I gotta get home and get my beauty sleep.
Squidward: Oh, what died on that guy's neck? Oh, it's his head.
[Squidward's insult was accidentally heard out loud by ChefBob.]
ChefBob: Huh?
[ChefBob comes up with an idea. He thinks that he could use insults to make himself popular. He slides over to Clay just as he was about to leave.]
ChefBob: Hey, what died on your neck? Oh, it's your head!
[The customers laugh, but Squidward is offended by it. Clay felt embarrassed at first, but laughs along with the customers.]
Squidward: Oh, that little plagiarist. That was my line.
Clay: [laughs] Obviously, the sleep hasn't been helping! [makes a hideous face as he laughs]
[SpongeBob becomes shocked at what he just heard.]
SpongeBob: D-did I say that? I didn't say that.
Jennifer Mille: [laughs and grabs ChefBob] Hey, do me! Insult me!
ChefBob: Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?
Jennifer Mille: [laughs] That was a good one.
ChefBob: [gets grabbed by SpongeBob] Huh? Oh!
SpongeBob: ChefBob, we don't speak like that to our customers.
Harold (red fish): Me next! [ChefBob goes back up] Shoot me a zinger!
ChefBob: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get that. [shoots an arrow on Harold's head] I don't speak "goober!"
[The paper with the word "Goober" rolls down and the customers laugh.]
Harold (red fish): [laughs] I love it! Guilty as charged! [laughs and sheds a tear]
[The customers yell out at ChefBob to make more insults and give him money and jewels. He even gives them their autographs for their books and their children.]
Squidward: Oh, great. I've created a monster. A funny, talented monster.
[The scene changes to ChefBob powdering his nose in his dressing room.]
Mr. Krabs: Ho, ho, ho, ho! [flicks money] Oh, I gotta hand it to ya! That new insult comedy act is really bringing in the money!
[SpongeBob, with a sad look on his face, turns around and gives Mr. Krabs a paper.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, what's this, here?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. It's a list of things ChefBob needs for his little dressing room.
Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho, does he? [reads the list] "Fresh cut seaweed." [his smile turns upside-down] "A manicurist for SpongeBob's puppet hand?" What? [gets angry] "A bigger dressing room?"
ChefBob: In the meantime, we'll just take over your office, Blubber Boy.
Mr. Krabs: Blubber Boy?! [his belly blubbers; he lowers his shirt and rips up the paper] No way! [stomps the paper bits on the ground]
ChefBob: [grabs Mr. Krabs] What's the matter, Krabs? [flicks his nose] You don't like money? [whacks Mr. Krabs in the face with money]
[Mr. Krabs takes the money and puts them in the bag.]
Mr. Krabs: [weepy] What?... Of course I like money. The office will be ready in five minutes. [leaves]
SpongeBob: ChefBob, I think your insults are mean and hurtful. What do you say we just go back to the Krabby Patty routines, huh?
ChefBob: Need I remind you that my insults pay your salary?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.
[SpongeBob and ChefBob leave the closet.]
Squidward: ChefBob, you stole my line! I do all the insults around here!
ChefBob: [grabs Squidward's hand] Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. You're absolutely right.
Squidward: Um, oh, well, uh, thank you. It's—it's—it's really not such a big deal.
ChefBob: Let me make it up to ya! [grabs Squidward and drags him and SpongeBob outside] Hi, everybody! I'd like to introduce you to a very good friend of mine: Squidward Tentacles!
[The customers cheer.]
Squidward: Huh? Oh, no. Please, please, you're to—you're too kind.
ChefBob: I was gonna ask Squidward how old he was, but then I remembered he can't count that high!
Squidward: [dumbfounded] Huh?
[ChefBob sprays water in Squidward's eye and the customers laugh at his humiliation. Squidward shrinks down nervously and pops.]
SpongeBob: [growls] Alright, that's it! You can't talk to Squidward that way! He is one of my best friends!
Squidward: [reappears next to Mr. Krabs] That's even more insulting.
ChefBob: Get a load of him, folks! He must've been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen! [grabs a rubber chicken and hits SpongeBob with it]
[The customers laugh. SpongeBob grabs the rubber chicken and goes to whack ChefBob with it, but ends up hitting Nat Peterson.]
Nat Peterson: Ow! Not funny!
[SpongeBob and ChefBob both get into a fight. ChefBob flings SpongeBob to a table and crash onto it. The customers continue to think this is part of the act and continue to laugh. ChefBob grabs SpongeBob, swings him around and flings him to the bathroom.]
Jimmy Gus: He scores!
[The customers rush into the bathroom.]
Fred: Yeah, yeah! Fight in the bathroom!
[ChefBob is trying to push SpongeBob down the toilet.]
ChefBob: Have a drink!
[SpongeBob struggles to get up, but ChefBob pushes him down the toilet. SpongeBob pulls the lever, hoping to flush ChefBob down along with him.]
ChefBob: No, no! [grabs the lever but gets flushed down the toilet]
[The customers become worried now that SpongeBob and ChefBob are flushed. In the kitchen, SpongeBob and ChefBob emerge from the sink and crash into a box of spatulas. SpongeBob and ChefBob engage in a spatula sword fight.]
SpongeBob: En garde!
[SpongeBob and ChefBob fight each other with all their might. They exit the kitchen and continue their fight in the dining room while the customers watch. ChefBob removes the spatula from SpongeBob's grasp and goes to finish him. SpongeBob holds his ground and keeps ChefBob's spatula from hitting him. ChefBob cackles evilly as if he was about to win. Just as ChefBob was about to deliver the final blow, SpongeBob lifts ChefBob, grabs the spatula with his teeth, and throws it onto a poster in the wall. SpongeBob hops in the boat, opens the cash register and slams the drawer onto ChefBob. The customers gasp in fright and realize that SpongeBob and ChefBob's battle is not part of the act and is not funny at all. The parent and the child cry at the sight. The customers become disgusted with this and they leave the restaurant just as SpongeBob collapses from exhaustion.]
Mr. Krabs: Me customers! [gets angry and walks over to ChefBob, who's punching SpongeBob] Alright, enough of this. [grabs ChefBob off of SpongeBob's hand and holds up a hand puppet version of himself]
Hand puppet Mr. Krabs: ChefBob, you are hereby fired! [punches ChefBob to the floor] Mr. Squidward, will you do the honors?
[Squidward holds up a hand puppet version of himself.]
Hand puppet Squidward: [picks up ChefBob] Let me help you slip into something more comfortable. Like the gutter!
[Squidward kicks ChefBob out the door. ChefBob gets run over by a boat, trampled on by a little girl's pogo stick, and swept away by a street cleaner.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I learned a very valuable lesson today.
Hand puppet Mr. Krabs: To always be yourself and not hide behind a puppet?
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, that, but [holds up his swollen hand] mostly don't slam your puppet hand in a register drawer. [his hand thumps]
[SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs all share a laugh together.]
SpongeBob: Ow.
[The scene changes to the next day. Squidward screams at something on the television.]
SpongeBob: [overlapping] What is it, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs: [overlapping] What is it, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: It's—it's alive! [points to the television]
TV Announcer: And now, it's time for the ChefBob Cooking with Insults Show! And here's your host, ChefBob!
ChefBob: Hi, everybody! Who's hungry?
[The live action audience cheers.]
ChefBob: Alright. Roses are red, violets are blue, I was born pretty, what happened to you?
[The live action audience cheer once more.]
ChefBob: Yay, yeah! Yay, yeah!
[SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are completely shocked and they all faint to the floor. The curtains close and the words "The End" appear on the screen, ending the episode.]


[SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in front of SpongeBob's house when the mailman comes walking by and puts a package into SpongeBob's mailbox]
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's here! [SpongeBob takes the package and opens it]
SpongeBob: Behold, Patrick! The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher! And it only cost me 52 box tops.
Patrick: Wow.
SpongeBob: [scratches his back with the backscratcher and grunts in pleasure] Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it!
Patrick: Let me try! [scratches his back]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher. That's my arm.
Patrick: [seeing his mistake]Oh, sorry. [reattaches his arm]
SpongeBob: You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves. We should let Squidward try it out.
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob:  [they start marching] Onward... to Squidward's house.
Squidward: [from inside] Go away!
SpongeBob: To Sandy's house. [cut to Sandy's treedome] Hey, Sandy, you gotta see this! [a bunch of inventions are torn up] Sandy? What's going on here?! Sandy, are you okay? [Sandy shudders] What's wrong, Sandy?
Sandy: They're coming. They're coming. The chimps are coming.
SpongeBob: Who?
Sandy: My bosses. They're coming for an inspection. I've worked day and night for a week, but none of my inventions are any good. If I don't have a real impressive invention by this afternoon, they'll cut my funding, and I'll have to leave Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive. [puts on the helmet with a peanut label on the forehead] What's it do?
Sandy: It lets you talk to nuts. What use is that?
SpongeBob: [takes out a nut] SpongeBob to Peanut. Come in, Peanut. [a radio can be heard beeping]
Patrick: What's it saying?
SpongeBob: It says... "It's dark in here." Got anything else, Sandy?
Sandy: There's my nuttaccino machine. It makes a nice, hot frothy cup of any nut you choose. [she puts a nut into the machine. The nut screams, which makes SpongeBob sad] And lastly, my fully automated nutcracker. [she turns it on. The nutcracker tries to crack open a nut, but it can't, and it gives up] Oh, I can't even make a simple nutcracker!
SpongeBob: So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick? [Patrick is using the backscratcher] Everything'll be fine.
Sandy: Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob! I just have to face facts. I'm leaving Bikini Bottom because... I'm a failure.
SpongeBob: We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick!
Patrick: What'll we do?
SpongeBob: They're looking for an invention, right?
Patrick: Right.
SpongeBob: So let's start inventing!
Patrick: Yeah! [cut to later, where SpongeBob and Patrick are carrying a table. Patrick falls over the table]
SpongeBob: It's time to get serious, Patrick.
Patrick: Right! [crashes] I made an invention. It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with.
SpongeBob: That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented. [more crashing]
Patrick: Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark.
SpongeBob: Light bulb, already invented. [more grunting and crashing is heard]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I know this one will work. I've invented a parallel universe.
SpongeBob: That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented.
Patrick: Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!
SpongeBob's Reflection: [says in a Ukrainian accent] Well, I thought it was a pretty good idea.
SpongeBob: [his invention crashes] Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything. [acoustic guitar plays. It's Sandy]
Sandy: ♪So long, Bikini Bottom, I can't leave without a good-bye. But please don't think bad of me, if'n I start to cry. So long, Bikini Bottom, there's so many things I'll miss, from your smoggy, crowded city, to your stingin' jellyfish. This town is filled with many things, that I've come to love. From the birds that fly upon the ground, to the flowers up above. Farewell, Bikini Bottom, now I really hate to go. 'Cause the things I'll miss the most of all, are the friends I've come to know.♪
SpongeBob: [both cry] I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever! [later, SpongeBob and Patrick are experimenting and building an invention] We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here.
Patrick: Who?
SpongeBob: Sandy's bosses. [Patrick is clueless] The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!
Patrick: [Clueless]I have no idea what you're talking about. [they both exit the treedome to greet Sandy's bosses]
Chimp #1: Good day, gentlemen. Allow me to introduce ourselves. I am Professor Percy. This is Dr. Marmalade.
Dr. Marmalade: At your service.
Professor Percy: And this is Lord Reginald.
Lord Reginald: Charmed.
Patrick: You guys talk funny. Say more words!
Professor Percy: We are the board of directors of Tree Dome Enterprises Limited, and we are here to ascertain if Miss Cheek's inventions are up to snuff.
SpongeBob: Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!
Patrick: And I used to be dumb. [goofy laughter]
Professor Percy: Quite. And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?
SpongeBob: My name is SpongeBob.
Patrick: And I am Professor Patrick.
SpongeBob: Professor?
Patrick: Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are.
Professor Percy: Where is Miss Cheeks?
SpongeBob: She should be back any moment.
Patrick: [Finally recalling what SpongeBob said]I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything.
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick to you!
SpongeBob: Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?
Patrick: Good idea.
SpongeBob: Well?
Patrick: Hey, you're the unpaid intern. You do the work. [cut to later, where everyone is standing in front of an invention]
SpongeBob: Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you... [reveals the invention] The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!
Professor Percy: This is where our research money went?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. Isn't it great?!
Lord Reginald: An automatic back scratcher, hair comber, nose picker, ukulele tuner. Yes, well, I've heard that claim before.
Professor Percy: Yes, how do we know this contraption works?
Dr. Marmalade: Let's see a demonstration.
Patrick: Step right up. [points to Lord Reginald] You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene.
Lord Reginald: Me? [Patrick straps him in the contraption] Are you sure this is safe?
Patrick: As sure as I'm a doctor professor.
SpongeBob: Patrick, don't you think we should test it?
Patrick: Okay. [turns invention on. The contraption comes down over Lord Reginald]
SpongeBob: That's not exactly what I had in mind!
Professor Percy: Lord Reginald, are you all right? [inside the invention, Lord Reginald is getting his hair trimmed]
Lord Reginald: Oh I say, this is splendid. [getting his back scratched] Oh, absolutely splendid. What's this? [nose is getting picked] Oh marvelous. This machine has evacuated my nostrils of unwanted residue in a manner most pleasant.
SpongeBob: Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.
Patrick: Thank you, lowly assistant.
Lord Reginald: Oh I say, now it's feeding me delicious pudding!
SpongeBob: Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention.
Lord Reginald: Now it's tuning my ukulele! [the ukulele makes two good notes then one sour note and the invention goes out of control. Lord Reginald is hit on the head with the ukulele] Ouch! I say, was that necessary? [he gets slapped on the back of his head] You sir, are impertinent. [a pair of scissors, fire, a saw, and more gadgets surround him] Oh, dear. [screams]
Dr. Marmalade: Lord Reginald, are you all right? [shrieks and explosions are heard] Um sorry, was that a yes?
Professor Percy: Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick, what is the meaning of this?
Patrick: It's okay. The horrible screaming means that it's working!
SpongeBob: Oh I really wish Sandy were here. [cut to Sandy, who is in front of a bus that has just pulled up]
Bus Driver: All aboard!
Sandy: Will this bus take you somewhere when you've got nowhere else to go?
Bus Driver: It sure does. We make stops in Quittersville, Failuretown, and Loserburg. [Sandy hears the screaming]
Sandy: What in tarnation?! [enters her treedome] What's with all the monkey business?! [gasps]
(Patrick laughs)
SpongeBob: Sandy!
Sandy: SpongeBob! What the heck is going on here?! [the invention spits Lord Reginald out]
Lord Reginald: Ouch.
Patrick: It works! It works!
Professor Percy: Lord Reginald, are you all right?
Lord Reginald: I seem to have ruptured my pomposity.
Professor Percy: We shall commence closure of this establishment immediately.
Dr. Marmalade: Frankly, I'm beginning to question the economic benefits of underwater treedomes. Doesn't make much sense once you get right down to it.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay.
Sandy: I was about to be fired anyway. Thanks for trying to help, SpongeBob. You, too, Patrick.
Patrick: That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.
Sandy: [annoyed at Patrick's stupidity] Don't push it.
Patrick: [meekly] Sorry.
Professor Percy: We are departing, Dr. Marmalade.
Dr. Marmalade: My word, all of this excitement has drastically reduced my potassium levels. [he takes out a banana, and the nutcracker turns back on and peels it] Good gracious! Can it be?
Professor Percy: Try it again. [Lord Reginald gets a banana out and the nutcracker peels it]
Lord Reginald: Oh! It is! It is! It's the banana peeler we have been searching 117 years for! [excited chattering from the chimps]
SpongeBob: Wow Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!
Sandy: Yeah. [cut to later when the chimps are about to leave]
Professor Percy: Well, Miss Cheeks, I must say you have exceeded expectations.
Lord Reginald: It may be the extreme head trauma I've suffered, but I am going to offer you a 20-year contract with a substantial pay raise.
Sandy: I accept.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
Professor Percy: I expect great things out of you, Miss Cheeks. Great things.
Lord Reginald: Perhaps you could put your talents toward that automatic poop-throwing machine that's eluded us for so long.
Dr. Marmalade: Now, now, one miracle at a time.
All Chimps: Goodbye!
Sandy: Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption.
Patrick: My turn. [sits on his invention] Whoo-hoo! [machine turns on and he screams] All right!


[SpongeBob is sitting inside of a box humming. He checks his watch. The mailman opens the mailbox, which turns out to be SpongeBob sitting inside his mailbox]
SpongeBob: Hi, mailman!
[The mailman yells in fear, and runs off]
SpongeBob: Okay, [gets out of the mailbox] see you tomorrow!
[Patrick walks up]
Patrick: Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?
SpongeBob: Let's see... [Looks through the mail] Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine!
[SpongeBob looks at the magazine]
SpongeBob: That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [They look inside the magazine] Whoa!
SpongeBob: Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!
[A picture of a rich person's swimming pool is shown]
SpongeBob: This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!
[A picture is shown of an old, rich person surrounded with bags of money]
Patrick: [Points at the man's feet] This guy's got shoes!
Squidward: Give me that! [Takes the magazine out of their hands] Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?
Squidward: They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.
SpongeBob: What kind of things?
Squidward: How should I know? Things people wanna buy. [walks off] Now keep your paws off my mail.
SpongeBob: That's it, Patrick! We gotta become entrepreneurs!
Patrick: Is that gonna hurt?
SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?
Patrick: Uh... [sweats] More time for thinking.
SpongeBob: No, something real, an item, something you would pay for.
Patrick: [pops up behind him] A chocolate bar?
SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick exiting the Barg'N-Mart carrying many chocolate bars]
SpongeBob: Fancy living, here we come!
Patrick: Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead.
[SpongeBob runs up and knocks on the door, Tom the fish opens the door]
SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some [holds up chocolate bar] chocolate?
Tom: Chocolate? Did you say, Chocolate?!
Patrick: Yes, sir. With or without nuts?
Tom: Chocolate?! CHOCOLATE?! CHOCOLATE! CHOCOLATE!
[SpongeBob and Patrick slowly back away, and then run off. Tom chases them while madly screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob ringing the doorbell of another house] 
SpongeBob: Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step! [A Con man opens the door] Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate?
Con man: Chocolate bars, eh?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!
Con man: Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!
[Patrick is shown holding many chocolate bars in his pants]
Con man: No, no no no, wrong. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, most certainly, sir!
Con man: Well, [chuckles] no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these! [He holds up a bright-orange bag]
SpongeBob: Wow... what is it?
Con man: It's a candy bar bag, you knucklehead! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!
[SpongeBob tries to touch it]
Con man: [pulls bag away] But, I'm wasting my time. [Walks inside] You don't need these bags.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We need 'em! We need 'em!
[The Con man grins, the scene changes to the Con man counting money. SpongeBob and Patrick are walking away with armfuls of bags]
Con man: So long, boys! Happy hunting! [Laughs when the two aren't looking] Suckers... [walks back inside]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing as they run off] Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!
SpongeBob: Let's try next door!
[SpongeBob walks up and rings the doorbell with his foot, the same Con man comes out]
Con man: Yes?
SpongeBob: Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?
Con man: I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags. [Holds up two large maroon bags]
Patrick: We'll take twenty!
[Scene changes to SpongeBob knocking on the door of a different house, Sadie comes out]
Sadie: Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?
SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?
Sadie: That sounds heavenly! I'll take one.
SpongeBob: One chocolate bar, coming up!
[SpongeBob attempts to pull out a chocolate bar, but keeps pulling more bags, while Patrick is zipping and unzipping his pants]
Sadie: [Sadie looks at her watch] I don't have time for this.
[Sadie goes back inside, and then SpongeBob pulls out a chocolate bar]
SpongeBob: I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice— [Sees something off camera; it is revealed to be Tom, still screaming]
Tom: Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate!
SpongeBob: —lady. [Tom chases SpongeBob and Patrick again while screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting in a diner] We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic.
Patrick: Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!
SpongeBob: No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?
Patrick: He said we were mediocre...
SpongeBob: That's it! He made us feel special!
Patrick: Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!
[Patrick runs to the door]
SpongeBob: No, wait, Patrick!
[Patrick freezes in place]
SpongeBob: Why don't we try being nice?
Patrick: Oh, okay.
[Scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking up to a customer's door]
SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good.
[Patrick knocks on the door, a customer opens the door]
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Hello?
Patrick: I love you.
[A harp is heard playing, the customer stares at SpongeBob and Patrick for a few seconds, then he slams his door shut in extreme disgust, a tuba is heard playing after the slamming]
SpongeBob: I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try.
[SpongeBob rings the doorbell, the customer opens the door]
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Please. G-Go away!
SpongeBob: Um, [clears throat] H-H-How you doin'?
Blue Fish with purple stripes: How am I doing?
SpongeBob: Wanna buy some chocolate?
Patrick: We got him now!
Blue Fish with purple stripes: Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, blubber boy?
[Patrick's belly is bubbling]
Patrick: Hee hee, it tickles!
Blue Fish with purple stripes: As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang.
[The customer holds up a picture of an obese self at age 13]
Blue Fish with purple stripes: You can keep that for five bucks.
Patrick: I'll take ten!
[Cut to SpongeBob with a sad look on his face walking, a sad song plays]
SpongeBob: We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that we're too easily distracted.
[Cut to Patrick staring at the pictures]
Patrick: Huh?
[Far cut]
SpongeBob: [raising his fist] Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.
Patrick: [Removing pictures from his face] Huh?
SpongeBob: [Holding out his hand] Let's shake on it.
Patrick: [Looking at SpongeBob confused] Did you say something?
[Cut to the other customer's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are seen entering the view]
SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, focus.
[Cut to the door, SpongeBob knocks on it, customer answers]
Purple Fish: Yes?
SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars.
[Patrick somehow moves up to the customer with his eyes going in and out back and forth]
Purple Fish: Why is Chubby here staring at me?
[Cut to Patrick's eyes]
Patrick: Focusing.
[Cut to the inside of the customer's house]
Purple Fish: [freaks out] Back up, Jack!
[The customer slams the door on Patrick's eyes, Patrick is heard saying "Oof!" from the other side of the door]
Patrick: [Moving eyes around] Nice place you got in here.
[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Patrick is eating a chocolate bar]
SpongeBob: I can't understand what were doing wrong.
Patrick: I can't understand anything.
SpongeBob: There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!
[Cut to the sign]
Patrick: [reading the sign] Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: They are most certainly not delicious!
Patrick: [smiling] Not the way I use them!
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Yet they sell millions of bags a day!
[Cut to Patrick]
Patrick: Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: [Happily] That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!
Tom: Chocolate!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run off, cut to Mary's house]
SpongeBob: We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!
Patrick: The kill!
[SpongeBob uses the doorbell, Mary answers]
Mary: Yes?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Hello, young lady.
[SpongeBob winks at Patrick, Patrick then chuckles]
SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate. [Getting a closer look at Mary] Is your mother home?
[Cut to Mary]
Mary: Mom!
Mary's Mother: [Entering from the right side of the house] What, what, what's all the yelling?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick who have stunned looks on their faces. Cut back to Mary's mother]
Mary's Mother: You just can't wait for me to die, can you?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Mary: They're selling chocolate.
Mary's Mother: Chocolate?
Mary: Yeah!
[Cut to Mary and her mom]
Mary's Mother: What, what are they selling?
Mary: Chocolates!
Mary's Mother: What?
Mary: Chocolates!
Mary's Mother: I can't hear you!
Mary: They're selling chocolates!
Mary's Mother: They're selling chocolate?
Mary: Yeah!
[Cut to a close-up of Mary's mother smiling]
Mary's Mother: Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.
[Cut back to view Mary and her mom]
Mary's Mother: I always hated it!
[Cut to SpongeBob sweating]
SpongeBob: Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...
[Patrick comes from the top left]
Patrick: You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.
[Cut to Mary and her mom, Mary is heard saying no constantly]
Mary's Mother: Live forever, you say? I'll take one. [Mary slaps her face. Cut to the outside, Mary pays SpongeBob a dollar]
Mary's Mother: [From inside house] Come on, you lazy Mary! [Cut to Mary] Start rubbing me with that chocolate!
Mary: [looking at SpongeBob and Patrick angrily] I hate you. [Slams door. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!
Patrick: [Raising fist] Hooray for lying!
[Bubbles transition to SpongeBob and Patrick, Patrick is seen with a look that was about to make him laugh]
SpongeBob: It'll make your hair grow.
[Cut to Fred]
Fred: Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, Patrick has a sad face this time]
SpongeBob: They'll make you sound smart.
[Cut to the customer holding money]
Customer: [southern accent] I'll take twenty!
[Cut to Patrick]
Patrick: It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.
[Cut to the two Patricks]
Patrick 2: Just in time.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick over and over]
SpongeBob: They'll make you fly!
Patrick: You'll fall in love!
SpongeBob: They'll bring world peace!
Patrick: You'll walk through walls!
SpongeBob: [echoing] You'll rule the world!
[Cut to a door, SpongeBob and Patrick are wrapped in casts. Cut close to Patrick]
Patrick: This'll be the best lie yet!
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!
[Customer opens door]
Customer: What can I do for you boys?
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.
Customer: Really?
[Cut to the customer, who apparently is in a cast covering his entire body]
Customer: Small world. What's the matter with you guys?
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are completely stunned]
SpongeBob: [nervously] Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.
[Cut to the customer]
Customer: Ah, some guys have all the luck.
[A violin begins]
Customer: I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, they both have faces meaning that they were about to cry]
Customer: At night, [As SpongeBob looks up sadly, a tear runs down his face] I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.
[Cut to the customer, the wires snap]
Customer: [About to fall] Oh, no...
[A glass breaking sound is heard while the customer grunts while hitting the steps]
Customer: [On the last step] Ow...
[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, let's help him!
[Cut to the inside of the house. SpongeBob and Patrick enter from the left]
SpongeBob: Careful, put him down gently.
[Patrick drops the customer's head, a glass breaking sound is heard, cut close to the customer]
Customer: [In pain] Ow...!
[Cut to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?
[Cut to the customer]
Customer: Well, there is one thing... as you can well imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars. [gestures his head over to a massive stack of chocolate bar boxes. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Cut to the customer looking out his window as SpongeBob and Patrick walk by]
Customer: Such nice boys, [far cut to the customer] it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! Ha ha ha!
[Cut to a close-up of the customer laughing while looking at his cash, zipping his costume off to reveal himself as the Con Artist from earlier. Cut to the street]
SpongeBob: [grunting] Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.
[SpongeBob makes another grunting noise, he trips up on a rock and falls, cut to SpongeBob with a box flat on his face]
SpongeBob: Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.
Patrick: [Walking in from the left] I can live with that. [Places box on SpongeBob's box and sits on it, making a small squeaking sound]
SpongeBob: Let's change our names to Why and Bother.
[Tom appears behind the box]
Tom: Chocolate! [Screams and knocks SpongeBob, Patrick and the boxes over. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick babble]
SpongeBob: [simultaneously with Patrick] No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...
Patrick: [simultaneously with SpongeBob] No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!
[Cuts to Tom laughing manically]
Tom: Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you... [turns back to normal] I'd like to buy all your chocolate. [Holds up a large amount of cash. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick looking shocked, chocolate bars fall out of Patrick's shorts, along with a Hershey's kiss. Cut back to the three, SpongeBob and Patrick melt]
SpongeBob: Thank you for your patronage.
[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene, Patrick is pushing a wheelbarrow]
Patrick: Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?
[Cut to the money in the barrel, SpongeBob pops out]
SpongeBob: Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.
[Cut to the two]
Patrick: But what are we going to spend it on?
[Cut to SpongeBob thinking. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene, a boat in a bottle with "Fancy!" on top is seen. Cut to the inside of the boat]
Squidward: [Walking in from the left] Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.
Server: Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.
[Cut to Squidward shocked]
Squidward: But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?
Server: Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs [leaning over to Squidward] and their dates.
[Cut to SpongeBob, Patrick, Mary, and Mary's mother, Mary is seen holding a glass]
SpongeBob: So, how long have you two ladies known each other?
[Pause]
Mary's Mother: What? What did he say?


[pans over live-action houses]
Narrator: And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate. [The exterior of Patchy's house is shown. The name "Patchy" appears. Inside, Patchy is wrapping presents]
Patchy:  [to the tune of "Jingle Bells"] Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho ho. [he notices he's on air] Oh! Hi. [he waves] I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club! [He notices a long piece of confetti on his hook and tries to shake it off. He pulls on it and whacks himself in the eye, giving him a black eye. He switches his patch over to the other eye] Hey, that's better! [Potty, a puppet bird on strings, flies in]
Potty: [squawks] Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Patchy: That's right, Potty! It is Christmas. [he limps over to the fireplace] And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year. [he blows on his pipe, and bubbles emerge] Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now! [He picks up a picture of SpongeBob. Cuts to SpongeBob, holding a remote]
SpongeBob: I sure am! [He presses a button on the remote. A large chimney rises from the ground next to his house, and a gigantic funnel pops out of it with the words "Welcome Santa" in neon letters] I'm ready! [Patchy laughs]
Patchy: Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae. [he puts down SpongeBob's picture] And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating. [He picks up a picture of Patrick. Cuts to Patrick standing by his house with a dopey smile on his face. Zooms out to reveal a single ornament hanging from the antenna on top of his rock. It snaps off and hits the ground. Patrick then falls to the ground as well. Now, Patchy is mixing cookie dough] I too am also preparing for Christmas. [he lifts up the mixer] Hmm, unbaked cookie dough! [he takes a lick] Mmm...
Potty: [squawks] Potty want cookie dough! [Potty flies over, squawking] Cookie! [Patchy ducks]
Patchy: Potty! No! [Potty flies back and forth]
Potty: Cookie! [squawks]
Patchy: Get out of here!
Potty: Cookie!
Patchy: Potty!
Potty: [squawks] Give us a lick!
Patchy: Back off, you flying freak! [Potty flies on the counter]
Potty: [squawks] Clarify please.
Patchy: [the cookies are shaped like SpongeBob and Patrick] This here cookie dough is for the children, not for pesky parrots. [Cuts to Hans reaching over and ringing a bell. Patchy looks out the window] What's that? Three bells! Well, we all know what three bells means!
Children: [off-screen] Free ice cream! [Patchy laughs]
Patchy: No, you silly livers. [sternly] No!
Potty: [squawks] Man overboard? [Patchy walks over to a desk]
Patchy: You, I'm ignoring. [he sits down] No, it's time to open fan letters! [Potty flies over with a letter in her beak]
Potty: [squawks] Here you go! [Patchy tugs at it]
Patchy: Thank you, Potty. [Potty is not letting go] Yeah. Okay Potty, thank you! [Potty squawks, still not letting go] Come on, give it, you birdbrain! [Potty squawks some more] Quiet, infernal bird! [He uses his hook, now with a pair of scissors on the end, to snip Potty's strings. Potty squawks and falls to the ground. Patchy nods] Hmm. [he sits back down] This letter comes to us from...
Fish Head: [as voiceover] Name and address withheld! [Patchy tears the envelope open, pieces of it flying all over. He pulls up his eye patch and replaces it with a pair of reading glasses with one eye covered up]
Patchy: And he writes, "Dear SpongeBob, I am ten years old, and I was wondering if you like Christmas as much as I do. Sincerely yours..."
Fish Head: [as voiceover] Name and address withheld! [Patchy gets up and takes off his glasses. Now his eye patch is back on]
Patchy: A very good question. But you know they didn't always celebrate Christmas in Bikini Bottom.
Potty: [squawks] They didn't?
Patchy: No sir, my fine feathered little neck pain. [He pulls down Potty's strings. Potty falls to the ground, and a puppeteer falls down from above the set. Patchy hangs a homemade SpongeBob ornament on a Christmas tree. Zooms out, showing the entire tree, which is decorated with many similar SpongeBob, as well as ornaments featuring Patrick and Squidward, and a few gift boxes] There was a time when no one had even heard of Christmas in Bikini Bottom. [he snaps his fingers] Hey! Who wants to hear the story of SpongeBob's very first Christmas? [Cuts to Potty, who looks very drowsy and with bloodshot eyes. Patchy turns around] Potty? [Patchy sees an empty bowl of cookie dough, accompanied by a foghorn noise] You ate all me cookie dough! [Potty is now incredibly fat. Potty's body and strings fall off, leaving only the bird's head]
Potty: Squ-ouch! [Patchy shrugs]
Patchy: Oh, well. On with the show.
[After the title card and opening credits, SpongeBob is shown waiting on a hill near Sandy's treedome, wearing karate gloves]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move. [practices karate and sneaks over to Sandy's door as Sandy hums "Jingle Bells"]
SpongeBob: What diabolical act is she committing now? [Sandy plugs in Christmas lights outside her tree and SpongeBob freaks out] Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire! [rushes inside and instead of throwing water on tree, he throws it on Sandy] Huh? So I guess there's no fire?
Sandy: What in the name of the Alamo is wrong with you, SpongeBob? Ain't you never seen a Christmas tree before?
SpongeBob: Christmas who?
Sandy: What?! Y'all never heard of Christmas?
SpongeBob: Is she a friend from Texas?
Sandy: [laughs] No. I can't believe you haven't heard of... [makes an adorable face] ...Christmas.
SpongeBob: Tell me more about this... [imitates Sandy] ..."Christmas."
Patchy: And so, Sandy wove the magical tale of gumdrops and pennywhistles. She told of toy-making elves and flying reindeer. But best of all, she told of the one they call, Santa Claus. [SpongeBob's eyes widen]
[The next day at The Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [standing on a table towards Squidward, Patrick and Mr. Krabs] And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.
Squidward: Yawn.
SpongeBob: But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you.
Patrick: Just like a genie. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine.
SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs. [grabs a piece of paper and pencil] Here you go! You can get started on your letter.
Squidward: I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts.
Patrick: Like a genie.
Mr. Krabs: Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus.
Squidward: Oh, brother.
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Okay, who's next?
Patrick: Ooh, ooh, me, me!
Squidward: Ooh.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Patrick.
Patrick: There's no words on this paper.
SpongeBob: Not yet.
Patrick: [grabs a pencil] Yippee! A writing stick.
SpongeBob: C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter.
Squidward: SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter. [Patrick's letter tears in half]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?
SpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid... [Patrick rips his again] ...ward.
Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob... [hands him another piece] Thanks. [sits down and starts writing with the paper on top of the pencil] Dear Sant... [paper rips] D'oh! Not again.
SpongeBob: Here, Patrick, watch me. [starts to write] Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish. [puts the letter in a bottle] Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!
[presses it and the bottle shoots up to the surface]
Patrick: Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?
SpongeBob: Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve.
Mr. Krabs: Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go.
SpongeBob: Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?
Mr. Krabs: A pony.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: With saddle bags full of money! [shoots a bottle up to the surface]
Patrick: Here you go, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What did you wish for, Patrick?
Patrick: Another piece of paper. [bottle shoots up to the surface]
SpongeBob: And what did you wish for, little girl?
Susie: Front teeth!
Cowboy: I could use a new hat!
Jennifer-Millie: I need a new hairstyle!
Lonnie: I'd like a glass of water for my teeth.
[lots of bottles get shot up to the surface]
Squidward: Excuse me, coming through, out of the way.
SpongeBob: Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?
Squidward: My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.
SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival.
Everyone: Hooray!

Wobbles: I hope he can read Portuguese.
SpongeBob: Ah, well that's the last letter. Wait! Squidward hasn't written his letter yet! [runs to Squidward with a pencil, bottles, and paper in hand] Squidward! Hurry! Squidward, Squidward! Hurry! [runs into Squidward's house and upstairs to have him write his letter]
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll help you get started. [writes letter for Squidward] Dear Santa Claus...
Squidward: SpongeBob, forget it.
SpongeBob: Right, too formal. Hi Santa...
Squidward: SpongeBob, no.
SpongeBob: Howdy, Claus?
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob out of his door] I'm not writing a letter to a figment of your imagination.
SpongeBob: But, Squidward, when Santa comes, you'll be the only one without a gift.
Squidward: SpongeBob, how many times do I have to say it? I don't believe in Santa Claus!
SpongeBob: C’mon, Squid, all you have to do is write a letter. What have you got to lose?
Squidward: My self-respect. My sanity. My lunch. [closes door]
SpongeBob: Squidward, c'mon. [everyone tries to get Squidward outside]
Citizens: C’mon, Squidward! Don't be a party pooper! C'mon out!
Squidward: [pokes head out of his window] Santa Claus is a big phony! SpongeBob has got you all fooled!
SpongeBob: C'mon, Squidward. C'mon! [closes window and gets in bed]
Squidward: Those idiots are gonna be up all night while I get a full night’s sleep. [tries to sleep, but the singing outside wakes him up]

SpongeBob: Uh, he should be here any minute. ♪Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.♪
Citizens: Oh, c'mon. Enough of this. [everyone argues and start to leave]
Fred: Thanks for the lies, Mr. Fairytale! Let's go waste our time somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Hey, guys, where's your Christmas spirit? He's just running late.
Patrick: He probably just stopped for a snack! Fat guys get hungry right?
SpongeBob: Yeah! [they wait and wait and then one of the jellyfish jars breaks on SpongeBob's head as the jellyfish floats away]
Patrick: Never trust a genie. [Patrick and a snowman walk away]
Squidward: [alarm goes off] Ah, morning already? Oh, boy! [speaking in a megaphone] Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Wait. Oh, I see a great Christmas photo op. Could you move in a little? [SpongeBob does so] Say Santa Claus.
SpongeBob: [very sad face] Santa Claus. [Squidward takes the picture]
Squidward: Aww, our first Christmas. ♪This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas. The first Christmas is this Christmas. [donkey appears on screen making noises] 'Cause it feels like the first Christmas to me.♪ [laughs at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: You were right, Squidward. This was a stupid holiday. [cries; takes out a present] I still want you to have this.
Squidward: What? What's this?
SpongeBob: A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... Santa came! [cries some more]
Squidward: Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I...
SpongeBob: You're welcome. [sadly walks off and cries]
Squidward: SpongeBob? He made me a present? It's probably a jellyfish net, or an old Krabby patty, or... [imitates a hillbilly] his favorite underpants. Haha. Present. [opens the present] Why, it looks like a clarinet. [smells it] It smells like one, too. Handcrafted out of driftwood. And it's even got my name on it. [finds a button that says "push"] What's this? [pushes the button and three wooden Squidwards with clarinets come out and bob up and down] Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. [sniffles] Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a... [donkey appears on screen and makes noises] big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob?  [SpongeBob is on a ladder trying to get his lights down]
SpongeBob: I guess I won't be needing this. [slides down with the lights in hand] That's better. [a gray cloud comes and rains on SpongeBob]
Squidward: The poor little guy. All he wanted was to spread a little joy.
SpongeBob: I'd better get this stuff off of Squid's place.
Squidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
SpongeBob: Huh? Hello? Who's there? Huh? Hello?
Squidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
SpongeBob: Hello? Yes. Who's there? Huh? Hello? Show yourself. Yoo-hoo. Hello? Who is it? Huh?
Squidward: Up here, you dunce. [dressed like Santa Claus] I mean, uh... Merry Christmas, little boy!
SpongeBob: [gasps] C-c-could it be?
Squidward: Yes, it is I, Santa Claus. Ho, ho, ho... [slips off the roof and hits the ground]
SpongeBob: Hey, you're S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... [takes a deep breath] S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... [takes a deep breath] S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...
Squidward: Hey, uh, kid, take it easy.
SpongeBob: S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... ta... [faints]
Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... [Squidward covers his mouth]
Squidward: Don't do that again.
SpongeBob: I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly?
Squidward: Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body.
SpongeBob: Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?
Squidward: Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny.
SpongeBob: And what about that nose? [pokes his nose and laughs] I knew you were supposed to have a big one, but that thing's gigantic. [laughs]
Squidward: Alright! I'm Santa.
SpongeBob: [jumps onto Squidward] Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.
Squidward: I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did.
SpongeBob: I did? [faints and falls on Gary's shell]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over.
Shelly: Do you have a present for me, Santa?
Squidward: Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really...
SpongeBob: [laughs] Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down.
Squidward: Uhh, right, just a second. [searches in his house for something] C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A book of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect! [hands the little girl a wrench] There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!
Shelly: Thanks, Santa. [scratches the wrench like it's a puppy]
Squidward: That almost felt good. [Squidward then notices a long line of citizens waiting for presents] I didn't... who?
Fred: Hey, Santa, where's my present?
Old Man Jenkins: And mine!
Abigail-Marge: And what about me?
Squidward: Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people. [searches for stuff in his house] Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you.
Jennifer-Millie: Thank you, Santa. This is just what I wanted. [puts bowl on her head] A new hairstyle.
[Squidward gives the little girl two forks]
Little Girl: Thanks, Santa. [She puts them on like front teeth]
Squidward: [gives Patrick a clock] Here you go, Patrick.
Patrick: Wow. [punches a hole through the clock] A wrist watch.
Fish: Thank you, Santa!
Squidward: [gives everything else in his house to the citizens] What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane? [SpongeBob knocks on the door] You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.
SpongeBob: Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind. [turns SpongeBob towards the door and pushes him so he walks] And Santa is... oh, his belly was small, but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward...
Squidward: Well, at least it's over. [notices a bottle with a letter in it on the ground] Huh? What's this?
Santa: Dear Squidward, thanks for all your help! You've been a real good boy this year. Warm regards, Santa Claus. [letter disappears into thin air] Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! [in his sleigh flying] Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho. [does a crazy dance while saying his "ho ho ho"]
Squidward: [Shocked to see Santa does exist and nonchalantly] Yup, I'm insane. [plays his wooden clarinet in the ending tone of the episode]
Santa: Merry Christmas! [back at Patchy's house, a sailboat with a homemade Sponge and Pat moves in front of a picture of the island, which has a bunch of presents on it]
Patchy: Dee dee, dee dee dee dee.
SpongeBob: [as a puppet] Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island!
Patrick: [also a puppet] Presents, ahoy.
SpongeBob: Hooray! [Patchy starts making storm sound effects] Oh, a storm!
Patrick: Yay! I mean yikes!
Patchy: [makes more sound effects and begins speaking in his own voice] Oh, we're going down! [He keeps making noises. Zoom out to show the boat is on Patchy's head] Trim the sails! Hoist the yardarms! Turn on the Weather Channel! [he screams]
Man on Set: [off-screen] Patchy?
Patchy: Oh, hi kids. Boy, that SpongeBob makes me as jolly as a roger. Well, I hope you enjoyed SpongeBob's Christmas tale. And I hope your Christmas is better than sunken treasure. [He takes the boat off his head. Potty flies out, and there is a nest underneath her. In it are a few eggs she laid, wrapped in bows. Patchy picks one up] Aw... Potty left me a little Christmas present. [He laughs. Then he goes over to the mistletoe] Argh, ye old mistletoe. And you know what that means. [he sprays breath freshener in his mouth] Ah, time for somebody to kiss Patchy the Pirate! [he makes kissing noises] Come on, who's it gonna be? Come on! Kiss the captain! [He laughs. Potty flies over and squawks. Patchy screams]
Potty: Give us a kiss! [Patchy goes to avoid him]
Patchy: No! No, not you! [Potty keeps flying around squawking] No, not you Potty! Get out of here! No, Potty! I don't wanna kiss you! No, we talked about this. Potty! No!
Potty: Kissy, kissy!
Narrator: Well, it looks like Patchy's pretty busy at the moment, so I'll say it for him. Good night, and happy holidays.
[the words "Happy Holidays" are spelled out on screen]


[episode opens at the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: Okay, Karen. Which one's better? [holds up two different napkin designs]
Karen: If I had eyes, I'd be rolling them right now.
Plankton: [sarcastically] Oh, thanks for the help. Ya know, details like this can be very important to the customers.
Karen: Customers? What customers?
Plankton: Well, uh..... [looks on screen and sees car in parking lot] ...like those customers, who just pulled up. [zips outside] Well, hello, gentlemen, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Would you like seating inside or outside?
Pilar: Seating for what?
Plankton: [angrily] For the Chum Bucket! Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum. [sarcastically] Oh, boy this is so... [pretends to eat it by hiding it behind his head] ...good. The chum is.
Nat: Wait a minute, eating chum? Do people do that?
Plankton: Look, are you gonna eat or not!?
Nat: Yeah. I'll gonna have two Krabby Patties.
Pilar: Oh yeah, two.
Nat: We couldn't find parking over at the Krusty Krab. [cuts to the Krusty Krab, jam-packed with cars. The two customers walk away]
Plankton: [burst out water from his head then drinks it, then sighs calmly] Now what was I saying? Oh right. [angrily rips up the menu and stomps on it] I'm tired of the Krusty Krab taking all of my business! We're doomed, Karen! Doomed, I tell you! [cries]
Karen: Well, why don't you do what all good business owners do?
Plankton: [still crying] What would that be?
Karen: Advertise your product, of course. [she gives Plankton part of the towel]
Plankton: Advertising? [stops crying] I can't believe it took me so long to come up with this [Karen sighs]
Plankton: [digging in a box of letters] Now let's see, Q no... P no...Ah, here it is, L! There, it's perfect! Chum is metabolic fuel! You really did it this time ol' Planky. Oh yeah, who's a genius. ♪Have you seen this, seen this, seen my genius, genius, genius, genius.♪ [Patrick begins reading the slogan. While this is happening, Plankton stops dancing and looks down at him]
Patrick: Chum is...[sips cup] meh...
Plankton: Hello, sir, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Er, sir?
Patrick: ...META...A...TAB...TAB...AB...BOL...IC...
Mini Brain Patrick 1: Forget about what that word means! There's a fire breaking out the language lobes!
Mini Brain Patrick 2: We need to get outta here! [Patrick Midget pushes on a door with signs saying "PULL TO OPEN"]
Mini Brain Patrick 3: The door's jammed!
Mini Brain Patrick 2: Push harder! [All start moaning and coughing]
Patrick: ...METAB...BO... [Head starts to smoke]
Plankton: Sir, your head, it's on fire. [Patrick jumps] The drink, use the drink!
Patrick: [Stares at cup] It's kelp juice, you want some? [Plankton takes drink from Patrick and throws it at his head] HEY! What kind of friend are you?
Plankton: Friend? I didn't even know y-
Patrick: Go ahead. Say you're sorry.
Plankton: Uh, I'm sorry?
Patrick: Okay, I forgive you. And...[shakes Plankton's hand] I'm sorry for yelling. Okay, so can I tell you something honestly?
Plankton: Whatever.
Patrick: It's about your sign. These words make my head sad.
Patrick's Head: [cries] I don't get it. [cries more]
Patrick: It's okay, little fella. I don't either.
Plankton: Okay, Freakshow, you just wait. In a few minutes, this sign will attract more than you can count.
Narrator: A few minutes later...
Patrick: Uhh, what's that number before one?
Plankton: Zero.
Patrick: Oh right, congratulations, you have zero customers!
Plankton: Okay, so it may take a little longer than a few minutes.
Narrator: A little longer than a few minutes later...
Patrick: Wait, what are we doing again? [Plankton gets angry. While he does, Patrick switches the letters around on the sign] There we go! Chum is Fum!
Plankton: What the? This says "Chum is Fum." You've changed my sign to "Chum is Fum?" That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Patrick: They seem to think it's interesting. [shows a bunch of customers coming into the the Chum Bucket. Chattering amongst the customers]
Plankton: Apparently, dumb sells chum. And I believe I've just found our Advertising Director. [Patrick chews off a bit of a letter "R." Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] Only two customers? Customers are looking kinda scarce. [Chuckles nervously] Must be low tide or something, eh Squidward?
Squidward: They've all gone to the Chum Bucket.
Mr. Krabs: The Chum Bucket? [He looks through a pair of binoculars and reads the sign above the Chum Bucket door] "Chum...is...Fum?" SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we have a situation.
SpongeBob: I'm on it. [He runs off]
[SpongeBob pulls a lever which activates a "Situation Alert" button. Mr. Krabs is pulled away to his office via a moving plank. Another plank tilts and SpongeBob slides down it. He uses his hat as a parachute and lands in the middle of a target with two closed vents to his left and right. The target turns SpongeBob to the vent on the right and both vents open. A large metal square shaped hand pushes him down the vent]
SpongeBob: [Taking a switch out of his pocket] Five. [A door with the Number 5 on it opens]
SpongeBob: Four. [A door with the number 4 on it opens up]
SpongeBob: Three. [A door with the Number 3 on it opens up]
SpongeBob: Two. [A door with the Number 2 on it opens up]
SpongeBob: One. [A door with the Number 1 on it opens up]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm afraid our worst fears have been realized.
SpongeBob: Ah! Goofy Goober is going non-dairy?
Mr. Krabs: No. [Pulling down a screen]
SpongeBob: Ooh. Slide show.
Mr. Krabs: [Changes slide] A few hours ago, the Chum Bucket was, as it should be, a desolate no-man's land. [Changes slide to a bunch of customers outside the Chum Bucket] There's only one way he could have changed things around so quickly. [Changes slide to Plankton sneaking past SpongeBob] Plankton must have slipped into the Krusty Krab while you weren't looking.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my legs.
Mr. Krabs: [Changes slide to Plankton stealing the Secret Formula] He stole the formuler. [A slide of SpongeBob screaming is displayed]
SpongeBob: [screams]
Mr. Krabs: I thought you'd say that. [Changes slide to him and SpongeBob sneaking to the Chum Bucket] So we need to infiltrate the Chum Bucket and steal the formular back.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are dressed in a brown-ish jacket with a clam on top. Mr. Krabs is on top of SpongeBob while he is struggling to keep his balance]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, how you holding up boy?
SpongeBob: Not so good, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hold on now. We're almost there.
Narrator: Two hours later...
Plankton: Next!
Mr. Krabs: We made it, SpongeBob. We're in! [They enter the Chum Bucket. This is chatter among the crowd of customers]
Nat: All I know is: Chum is Fum.
Pilar: You said it. Chum is Fum.
Mr. Krabs: Keep an eye peeled for anything suspiciourous
SpongeBob: [struggling] Like that door? [camera moves to reveal door that has two signs covering windows saying "TOP SECRET" "STAY OUT!"]
Mr. Krabs: Eh...BINGO! Giddy up, boy, We're almost there. [Opens door]
Patrick: Huh?
[Plankton immediately runs up to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs. Door closes]
Plankton: Excuse me, would you like a free sample?
Mr. Krabs: No, uh [clears throat. Changes his voice with a falsetto voice] I'm full, thanks!
Plankton: No? How 'bout your little friend? Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi! I don't want a free sampl-
Plankton: [Stuffs the Chum in SpongeBob's mouth] Sure you do. Look out! She's gonna blow!
[Disguise expands and camera cuts to the outside of Chum Bucket and shows explosion. Camera cuts back to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs out of disguise]
SpongeBob: Blegh, Aheh, Agh, Agheh [Pulls out tongue and starts scrubbing it]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Well, he obviously didn't steal me formular, but how did he steal all my customers?
Pilar: This chum tastes awful.
Nat: Yeah, but that slogan is so catchy that we can't stop eatin' it.
Nat and Pilar: CHUM IS FUM! [They both throw up]
Plankton: Ah hehehehehehe [takes breath] Chum is fum! Ah he he!
Mr. Krabs: [Takes SpongeBob by the tongue] Come on, SpongeBob...
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs leave scene]
Plankton: I'm gonna see how our advertising guru is doing. [Goes into "top secret room"] What brilliant slogans have you come up with this week, Patrick? [Walks in front of Patrick only to find him asleep]
Patrick: [snore. sleepily] Hm, huh?
Plankton: [facepalms] Gah! You're supposed to be coming up with witty catchphrases to keep that rabble out there happy! [jumps up onto easel] Chum is Fum...We kinda got that one already. [Flips poster paper up to reveal CHUM IS FUM]
Patrick: OOH I like that one!
[Plankton flips poster paper up again to reveal CHUM IS FUM again. Plankton flips poster paper up again to reveal multiple CHUM IS FUM on whole sheet. Plankton flips poster paper up again to reveal CHUM IS FUM together in the shape of Patrick. Flips paper up to reveal CHUM. Flips paper up to reveal IS. Flips paper up to reveal FUM]
Plankton: Agh. Oh well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. [jumps down] Keep up the good work...I guess...
Patrick: You got it boss!
Plankton: [Opens door to the crowd and announcing] HEY EVERYONE! CHUM IS FUM!
[Crowd cheers. Bubble transition to outside of Chum Bucket showing a line up that goes till the outside]
Plankton: Hey Karen, check this out!
Karen: What now?
Plankton: You see, every time I make a sale the sound goes there, Watch! [Opens cash register. *CHA CHING*. sound goes to microphone outside to 3 loud speakers on top of the Chum Bucket]
Mr. Krabs: [Cries]
Karen: How is that gonna help to boost sales?
Plankton: Karen, babe, you don't need help when you have a catchy slogan like mine.
Karen: Don't look now, but I think your catchy slogan days are numbered.
Plankton: [Turns around and looks at the customers]
Nat: [Barfs on floor] Uhh...something's not right.
Pilar: Yeah, I know, I keep sayin' "Chum is Fum" but it...ehh...it's just not workin'.
Nat: I'm outta here. [Throws ChumStick on the floor and leaves]
Pilar: [Also throws away ChumStick and leaves]
Plankton: Hmmmm....
[Bubble transition to Patrick sleeping]
Plankton: [Shouting] PATRICK!
Patrick: [Wakes up] Huh?!
Plankton: We're having a board meeting here! We need ideas!
Patrick: [examining graph that the line ends inside the toilet] Hmmmm, Mhmmmm, Uh huuuh. I think I see the problem. Your potty has a shocky thing in it!
Plankton: NO! That's not it you FOOL! We need a new slogan! You need to come up with another genius catchphrase like "Chum is Fum"! But different.
Patrick: Oh... Gotcha. Hmmmmmm.
Narrator: 3 days later...
[Cuts to outside of Chum Bucket with a longer line of customers. zooms in on new sign "FUM IS CHUM"]
Nat: I'm so happy that they changed that old tired slogan, "Chum is Fum".
Pilar: Yeah, that new slogan "Fum is Chum" is way cooler.
Nat: Way cooler!
[Nat and Pilar pick up Chum Bucket Supreme and start eating and barfing into their buckets]
Plankton: [Gives bucket of chum to a customer] Here's your Chum Bucket Supreme, enjoy! Patrick, my boy, you really earned that promotion!
Patrick: [Washing dishes] Thanks, boss.
Plankton: Nothing can stop me now!
[Shows montage of Plankton's Success. people eating chum, bilboard posted up with new slogan, being on cover of Bikini Bottom restaurant magazine, many cars parked outside of Chum Bucket, local hockey team lining up for chum]
Plankton: You fellas look hungry, here you go! [Throws the chumsticks at the hockey players and they fight for it]
Patrick: Excuse me, sir. [hands resignation slip] My resignation. [shows picture of himself in fighter plane shooting bullets]
Plankton: But you're my whole marketing department.
Patrick: I know, but I'm "burned out." See? [Turns around to show back of head burned making a hole] Anyway, you can send my check to my home.
Plankton: [rips resignation] Check? You want money for those stupid catchphrases? Anybody can sell to my idiot customers. [over loudspeakers] They're buffoons! Morons! They'll buy anything I sell them. They're the dumbest of the dumb! [Frank and Nancy throw away chum] The stupidest of the stupid! [Debbie Rechid and Susie throw away Chum] They're dummies, dweebs and doodoo dunderheads! I can keep that rabble right where I want 'em! Huh?
Hockey Player: What was that part about doodoo dunderheads, eh?
Plankton: Uh-oh!
[Hockey Players beat up Plankton and kick him out of the Chum Bucket]
Hockey Player: Where do you think you're going, little man?
Plankton: Is it too late for sorry? [gets squished on tee] D'OH!
Hockey Player: [chuckles] Hey, check out that new sign at the Krusty Krab. Who's hungry, eh?
[Hockey players cheer and run to Krusty Krab as plankton gets squished]
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. K., we're back in business!
Mr. Krabs: Yep. [shouting at Patrick] Keep up the good work, boy'o!
Patrick: You got it, boss! [Paints "Krabby Patties are Fum" on a banner]


[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab, at closing time.]
Squidward: Just clock out already!
SpongeBob: I'm trying Squidward, but clocking out is the most upsetting part of the day. At least soon I'll be home, where I can relive all the wonderful moments from my day at work. [has flashback] I'm all over it boss man. [makes patty] Order up Gare-ward!
Gary: Meow-Meow. [meow version of Yeah Yeah]
SpongeBob: It's so hard to leave, even for one night.
Squidward: I beg to differ. [switches ID cards] I mean, just look at this place [cuts to shot of the mess that happened at the restaurant], it's disgusting. Not to mention our cheap boss.
Mr. Krabs: [flips penny from the floor with a spatula, in his hand] Woo-hoo! Got it. Hey who are you calling cheap?
Squidward: The guy who won't even spree for a doormat!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, give me a break Mr. Complains a Lot, as if you know anything about running a restaurant. [laughs]
Squidward: Well if I did run a restaurant, my exquisite taste in gourmet know-how would have customers waiting in line for years, just to get a table.
Mr: Krabs: [laughs to himself] See you fellas tomorrow. Gourmet know-how. [laughs]
Squidward: Laugh it up! My knowledge and intelligence could even make the Chum Bucket a success
Plankton: Hey, hey, hey! I'm yelling over here! [jumps on SpongeBob and then on Squidward's head]
Squidward: Ouch! I think I picked up a tick. [rips plankton off his head] Plankton, what do you want?
Plankton: Well I like to take you up on your offer to make a Chum Bucket a success!
Squidward: Oh, I don't know about that.
Mr. Krabs: I don't value you at all! [laughs]
Squidward: I'll do it.
SpongeBob: [pokes Squidward and he notices him] Don't you think that working at the Chum Bucket AND The Krusty Krab is a conflict of interest Squidward?
Squidward: Gee SpongeBob, I haven't thought of that, you're right. I quit.
[bubble transition to the interior of the Chum Bucket]
Squidward: Euggh, a bit industrial but I can make it work.
Squidward:  [enters the kitchen of the Chum Bucket] You call this a kitchen? We should start by tearing out this wall so the chef is visible to his adoring fans.
Karen: Great, two mega-la-maniacs.
Squidward: I don't see any use for these ol' claptraps. We should just break them down for parts. [tears claptraps out]
Plankton: But, but that's my Chum fueled antenna massager.
Squidward: Oh, I'm sorry, remind me, who's in complete creative control here?!
Plankton: Anyone can come in and redecorate pal, but you still haven't proven how you're going to make Chum edible.
Squidward: So I guess the proof is in the pudding, then isn't it?
Plankton: You're making Chum pudding?
Squidward: I'm making Chum Fricassee. [pulls the string and squirts out the Chum from the dispenser into the wheel barrel]
Plankton: Frica-what?
Squidward: You see Plankton [puts a finger into chum and picks it up with it], there's a trick to making Chum edible. [smells the chum and flings it back into the wheel barrel] We just have to follow Grandma Tentacles secret fricassee recipe.
Plankton: Secret recipe, you say huh? What's in it? [pulls out notepad and pencil]
Squidward: Nice try, tiny cyclops, you won't get Grandma's delicate mix of seasonings and spices that easily. But, preparation cannot be rushed, each batch much simmer for exactly 24 hours.
French Narrator: 24 hours later...
[cuts to Plankton resting his head on the dining table and a spatula flips the fricassee on the plate]
Plankton: Who took my blue blanky!? [notice the fricassee on the plate] Huh, this is the secret stuff? Doesn't look very promising.
Squidward: Oh just taste it already!
Plankton: [sniffs fricassee] Well the smell doesn't make me wretch. [scoops up a piece with a spoon and tries it] Hey, that ain't bad at all! [takes second scoop and tries it] It's actually amazing! [jumps on the table and eats the whole thing, and throws away the spoon and the plate] This is gold in the form of chum! [jumps on Squidward's head] Squidward my friend, you'll be the toast of Bikini Bottom! This recipe is going to make you a star.
Squidward: A star.
Plankton: A star.
Announcer for Flavors of the Bottom&#160;: Hello hungry eaters, it's time for, Flavors of the Bottom, a delectable at dining out at Bikini Bottom,  look with your host Perch Perkins!
Perch Perkins: Hey all you bottom feeders! If you already eaten, well you might want to make room for seconds! [camera zooms out to a shot of Le' Chum Bucket] [cuts to the interior] Cause' we are tasting Bikini Bottom's new upscale eatery, Le' Chum Bucket. [cuts to classy customers at the table] Look at all those classy diners. What's on the menu? It's called, Chum Fricassee. [cuts back to him] Earlier, I spoke to head chef Squidward Tentacles. He shared with us why it's such a, Frica-success!
[customers eat it with a fork, only to like it, throw away the fork, and eat the whole thing off their plates]
Squidward: Actually, I can't share the recipe with you, it's a secret.
Mr. Krabs: [cuts to him watching his restaurant be a success on the news with a TV on the table] What?
Plankton: [laughs] That's right Krabs [TV view goes back in full screen], now we have a secret formula, and it's a bottle, and you can't have it! [laughs]
Squidward: Give me that, please. [snatches formula out of Plankton's hand] Thank you.
Plankton: [yells into microphone] Secret!
Mr. Krabs: Shhhh [stammering], what's gotten into you?! [whispers] High fo-looting customers don't bark on the top of their lungs like a sea dog!
Mr. Krabs: Reservation?! In this sinkhole?!
Squidward: What's seems to be the problem? Well, well, well, [blows Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob's disguises off their faces with a fan] if it isn't Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob. Now just follow me. I believe I have a table reserved just for you. [the 'table' that Squidward 'reserved' for Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob turns out to be a toilet. Squidward puts a tablecloth on the toilet] Bon Appetit, Suckers! [laughs at them as he walks away. Soon, everyone joins in the humiliation by laughing at Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob as they leave the restaurant in sadness] See you in two years! [laughs and scoffs at them]
Karen: There's a two-year wait for a table.
Plankton: Yeah, see how you like it Krabs! [laughs]
[the whole crowd laughs at them while they walk away in misery]
French Narrator:  One week later...
[shows a line of Squidward's fans]
Nancy-Suzy Fish: I was here first!
Tyler: No, I was!
Squidward: One at a time, please.
Nancy-Suzy Fish: Oh, Mr. Tentacles, it's so nice to finally meet you!
Squidward: Yes, isn't it? [signs her autograph book with Squidward's picture on it] Next? Whoa! [notices the line is becoming long and slow] Plankton!
Plankton: [frying the chum fricassee in nuggets] Yeah, what's up?
Squidward: Are you not seeing the line of people out there?! What's the hold-up with the new batch of Fricassee?!
Plankton: What's the hold-up? You said it took exactly 24 hours. [points to the machine with the cooking time at about an hour before 24 hours]
Squidward: I don't care if it isn't finished! Just take the orders!
Plankton: But I haven't even sauteed it yet. Whatever you say. [cuts to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob sitting alone on the side of the road]
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? [cries as SpongeBob comforts him]
SpongeBob: Oh, sir, I'm sure that the new Chum Fricassee can't taste better than a Krabby Patty. [cuts to a customer walking out of Le Chum Bucket with leftover in his bag]
Plankton: Thank you, sir. Come again. Enjoy your leftovers.
Tyler: Oh, I will. [sees Mr. Krabs crying in agony and grief. Tyler gives Mr. Krabs his leftovers] Please, sir. Take my chum. It's the least I can do to help. Poor guys.
Mr. Krabs: [digs into the bag and pulls out the leftover Chum Fricassee] You go first, boy.
SpongeBob: [takes a bite of the Chum Fricassee] Hey, this is great!
Mr. Krabs: Better than a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: A what?
Mr. Krabs: [also takes a bite of the Chum Fricassee and gasps] This is delicious! No! I'm ruined! [cries in agony as SpongeBob comforts him]
Squidward: [Meanwhile, the line keeps getting longer and longer and Squidward continues to serve his Chum Fricassee to his customers and fans] Here you go, folks. Enjoy my world-famous Fricassee. [All of a sudden, someone bursts through the front door, which turns out to be Squidward's paternal grandmother and she's not very happy] Grandma!
Grandma Tentacles: [enters the restaurant and corners her grandson by the kitchen doors] Someone's been cooking my recipe [sniffs] and they're doing it wrong!
Squidward: What are you doing here?
Grandma Tentacles: Saving my recipe from my bumbling grandson! [crushes Squidward's foot with her walker]
Squidward: [in pain] Ow! I didn't do it! Uh, uh, it was him! [points to Plankton]
Plankton: What?! Oh, you're not pinning this on me! You said you didn't care if it was ready or not!
Squidward: Okay, I admit it! I admit it! But--but what's the big deal? [Grandma Tentacles crushes her grandson’s foot with her walker again, for the second time] Ow!
Grandma Tentacles: The big deal is when the chum is not cooked for exactly 24 hours, it causes severe tummy trouble!
[Listening to Grandma Tentacles’ words, the customers get angry.]
Male Fish: You fed us, undercooked chum?!
Grandma Tentacles: Tear him apart, people!
[She walks off while the customers form a mob and start to attack Squidward. They do an uproar, following what his paternal grandmother says.]
Fred: I've had it and I'm not gonna take it anymore! [Fred picks up a trash can then throws it on a table. Other customers throw their chum meals on the ground and on the wall of the Chum Bucket. Another customer rips apart of an awning. Frank grabs a napkin holder, throwing napkins on the floor. Plankton pops up near the napkins.]
Plankton: Not the napkins! [Frank doesn't listen to Plankton.]
Angry Mob: [An ax chops Squidward's picture in half.] He got what he deserves, that's what I say! [Elsewhere in the exterior of Le Chum Bucket, it bursts into flames caused by the mob. As the restaurant is on fire, the customers run out of the Chum Bucket] It's on fire! It's all burning! Run! [the fire incinerates the restaurant, leaving only Plankton and Squidward standing with charred faces]
Plankton: My restaurant! [cries]
Squidward: My fan base! [cries harder before his paternal grandmother appears.]
Grandma Tentacles: I hope you learned your lesson, genius! [crushes Squidward's foot with her walker for the third time]
Squidward: Ow! [Plankton and Squidward wail]
SpongeBob: [cuts to the Krusty Krab] Gee, Mr. Krabs, it sure was nice of you to hire Squidward back. Especially since he tried to destroy your business and all.
Mr. Krabs: I figure it's the least I can do for him after causing all that mayhem over at the Chum Bucket. In fact, I promoted him. He's our new doormat!
Squidward: Ow! [laying on the floor like a doormat as punishment] Living the dream! [Moaning and groaning, some customers who destroyed the Chum Bucket wipe their feet on Squidward.]


Sandals: Uhh, what do you like better? The coral bits or the nacho oyster skins?
Squidward: I like neither. Can I take your order?
Sandals: What about the barnacle rings, are they any good?
Squidward: No. What will you have?
Sandals: Well, uhh, what's your vote on the kelp?
Squidward: [He finally loses his temper and he throws the paper and pencil in anger] Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?
SpongeBob: [Pokes his head out from behind the kitchen window] Psst, try the coral bits.
Sandals: Uhh, I'll try the coral bits.
Squidward: That'll be one dollar. [Rings up one dollar then a siren goes off]
Sandals: What's going on?
Squidward: Something stupid, I'm sure. [Alarm stops as a curtain opens up to show a real band in the background playing carnival music. Mr. Krabs comes out from the restroom, cheering]
Mr. Krabs: Yippee! [kisses Sandals and Squidward. Takes the dollar and laughs hysterically as he rubs it all over himself] Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!
Squidward: See? I told you.
SpongeBob: What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [Looks weird as he runs over to the counter] Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!
Squidward: A very dirty dollar?
Mr. Krabs: No, this is my one millionth dollar earned. Every Krab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine. Congratulations, sir, you have just given me my one millionth dollar!
Sandals: Ha, great. Uhh, what do I win?
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, now get out.
Sandals: Uhh, what?
Mr. Krabs: Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment! [Pushes everyone out the door] Me millionth dollar.
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Congratulate yourselves, lad. A captain's nothing without his loyal crew. I mean, a crew like you [He imagines SpongeBob and Squidward looking deformed] comes around maybe once in a lifetime! And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.
SpongeBob: Wow, a trip!
Squidward: I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. Where are we going? Fancy Springs?
[Scene cuts to the three of them in a pool]
Mr. Krabs: No...
Squidward: Pamper Island?
[Scene cuts to the three of them laying on towels at a beach]
Mr. Krabs: Try again...
Squidward: Oh! Oh! Oh! Bikini Bottom Folk Village?
[Scene cuts to the three of them in 18th century clothing]
Mr. Krabs: Better than that!
[Scene cuts to them wearing raincoats on a boat accompanied by a foghorn noise]
Squidward: ...clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work? [Clams are jumping] Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?
Mr. Krabs: Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams [Catches a clam then he throws it back] then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?
Squidward: No. [Takes off his raincoat and sits on his chair] And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?
Squidward: How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?
SpongeBob: Okay! [SpongeBob casts his line behind him which catches on Squidward's magazine. SpongeBob brings his line forward and casts it in the lagoon. SpongeBob casts Squidward's chair]
Squidward: Hey, watch where you're swinging that! [SpongeBob casts Squidward's shirt out in the lagoon] SpongeBob, be careful with tha- [SpongeBob casts Squidward's nose into the lagoon] [loudly in pain] AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! [Squidward walks up to Mr. Krabs] Okay, I've had enough...
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up. [SpongeBob is still casting out items while Mr. Krabs talks to Squidward] Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose. [Laughs. The hook in SpongeBob's fishing rod touches Mr. Krabs millionth dollar. Gasps] Me millionth dollar! [SpongeBob rips Mr. Krabs' pants off and casts his dollar to the lagoon] SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya. [Music plays] Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in! Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster! [SpongeBob reels it in as fast as he can. Mr. Krabs opens the doors to the orchestra] There you are, you stinking bilge rats. Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it! Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Here she comes... [Mr. Krabs begs; SpongeBob reels the dollar in] ...she made it!
Mr. Krabs: [Holds up the dollar and cheers] For a second or two, I thought she was a goner! [Ominous orchestra music plays again. Suddenly, a giant clam jumps up and takes Mr. Krabs' dollar. It takes a while for Mr. Krabs to notice his dollar isn't in his claw anymore. The clam swims away. The scene cuts as Mr. Krabs’ eyes well up with tears, and he begins to cry]
Squidward: So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, you're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar! [sobbing and flops to the ground] I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back. [Whips his eyes against the floor] Never, never, never, never, never!
SpongeBob: I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up. [Mr. Krabs is literally in pieces, crying]
Squidward: Oh, please, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act. [Mr. Krabs is crying while sucking his feet] Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar. [Mr. Krabs continues weeping as he pours tears into his mouth] For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up! [Mr. Krabs' eyes inflate then squirt out tears] Mr. Krabs... [Mr. Krabs is wailing like a fountain] Mr. Krabs... [Mr. Krabs is sobbing like a faucet. Squidward has had enough.] Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!
Mr. Krabs: [Sucks on a thumb then he throws it away] You will? Great! Wait right here. [Runs off to get some items and comes back with a bunch of fishing gear on] Here's where clam fishing gets serious. [Scene cuts to later in the day where Mr. Krabs is on top of the boat and SpongeBob and Squidward are on the lower deck] Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip.
SpongeBob: [Salutes] Aye aye, captain!
Mr. Krabs: And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar. [Mr. Krabs scouts the area. Scene cuts to later where Mr. Krabs has a beard on from scouting for too long. Squidward and SpongeBob look the same as Mr. Krabs]
Squidward: [Ripping off his beard] That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!
SpongeBob: Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary. [Scene cuts to Gary chewing up SpongeBob's couch at home]
Squidward: We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar. [Takes a dollar out of his wallet] Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?
SpongeBob: Oh, I get ya. [Jabbers. Scene cuts to later in the day where Mr. Krabs is still scouting the area]
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs steers his eyes toward the other two to see them waving a dollar] Look what we've got!
Mr. Krabs: [Jumps down and gasps] Could it be? [Takes the dollar] Me millionth dollar? [Starts cheering again as well as SpongeBob and Squidward] Whoo-hoo! [Rubs the dollar on himself but he notices something strange so he stops dancing] Wait a minute... [Rubs the dollar back and forth again and points at the dollar] This isn't me millionth dollar. [SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other] This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, [Shows dollar bill just like described] and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.
SpongeBob: [wearing blue lipstick] Actually, it's Coral Blue number t- [Squidward whacks him on the head with a fishing rod to shut him up, but it's already too late]
Mr. Krabs: I trusted you, and you gave me this?! I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this. [sobs]
Squidward: No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.
Mr. Krabs: [stops sobbing, then narrows his eyes] I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.
Squidward: You're kidding?
SpongeBob: Woo! Is it another fishing trip?
Mr. Krabs: No. It's this sandwich. [Nails the sandwich to a pole]
Squidward: A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?
Mr. Krabs: Not a sandwich. [throws the other sandwiches into the lagoon] The sandwich.
Squidward: Whatever, we've got plenty more to- [He and SpongeBob get shocked. Mr. Krabs throws the refrigerator into the lagoon] ...eat.
Mr. Krabs: Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back!
Squidward: Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!?
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Squidward: Just look at him! [Pointing to Mr. Krabs, who is dressed like he is at a funeral sobbing at a tombstone with the words 'R.I.P. Me Millionth Dollar' on it. He then hugs it.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you- [cuts off after Mr. Krabs laugh oddly]
Squidward: Look again. [Mr. Krabs uses his eyes as a jump rope while giggling like a crazy person]
SpongeBob: [now visibly scared] You're right. How do we get outta here?
Squidward: If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.
SpongeBob: Okay. [Both take a step, then start screaming as they sprint over to the lifeboat. They jump into it but then come back onto the boat tied up; Mr. Krabs pops his head out of the lifeboat]
Mr. Krabs: [Angry] So you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. "It's just a dumb old dollar! Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice!" [sobs] Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you. [Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs hanging his line over the boat. SpongeBob and Squidward are attached to the line] Live bait.
Squidward: You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?
Mr. Krabs: [Dressed up as a conductor] Oh, he'll come. [Taps the book using his baton and the doors open up to the orchestra and begins to play the ominous music; SpongeBob and Squidward shake and scream in terror]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say... [Yells] YOU ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR MIND!!! [Mr. Krabs giggles madly while conducting the orchestra. The giant clam emerges above the lagoon coming closer to the two on the line] Get us out of here!
Mr. Krabs: Come on, fresh meat! [SpongeBob and Squidward scream as they try to wiggle back and forth to avoid the giant clam] Keep thrashing! He likes it! [Both continue to scream and bounce up and down really fast] Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there. [Giant clam shows the dollar on its tongue] That's it! [Closes the doors to cause the music to stop. The giant clam stops in mid-air and Mr. Krabs jumps inside it to take the dollar] Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it! [Rubs his dollar on himself] I finally got me millionth dollar...! [Cabin doors open to play the ominous music again. The giant clam closes its mouth, with Mr. Krabs inside, and dives into the lagoon. Cabin doors close after the conductor takes a bow]
SpongeBob: Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives. [A tear falls down his cheek] Why couldn't it have been me?!
Squidward: Yes, why couldn't it have been you?! [Sobbing]
SpongeBob: Why did he have to go like this, why?! [Crying]
Squidward: Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?! [Both sob]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, boys! [SpongeBob and Squidward stop sobbing]
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs' head is above the lagoon]
Mr. Krabs: Have you boys met... [Holds his millionth dollar up] ...me millionth dollar? [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wow, how did you get it back?
Mr. Krabs: It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter, so eventually, we settled on a trade.
SpongeBob: What did you give him? [Mr. Krabs jumps back up on the boat, revealing himself as only having a head and left arm]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing important. [Laughs. SpongeBob and Squidward look shocked.]


[scene starts with Squidward leaving his house on a bicycle while he hums a tune.]
Squidward: There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go. [starts riding his bicycle to work and passes a tall piece of stalk with a treehouse on top of it with SpongeBob and Patrick in it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling]
SpongeBob: Wey, wook. It's Widward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
SpongeBob: Widward's woing to work.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
Squidward: [growls]
Patrick: Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
Squidward: What's that supposed to be— some kind of stupid secret code?
SpongeBob: We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.
Squidward: Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron? [laughs] Moron... [laughs again] as a requirement. [laughs again]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!
Squidward: Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!
Patrick: [whispering to SpongeBob] What did he say?
SpongeBob: [whispering to Patrick] I don't know. Something about his nose?
Patrick: [sticks his head out of the "Clubhouse" and talks to Squidward] Squidward, you and your nose will definitely NOT fit in.
Squidward: Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in? [takes off his hat and starts to climb up the "Clubhouse"] Why, you should be begging me to join!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!
[Squidward grunts as he tries to get in the "Clubhouse"]
Squidward: Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!
Patrick: That's what we've been trying to tell you!
SpongeBob: We've been stuck up here for three days.
Patrick: We told you you wouldn't fit in.
Squidward: [sneers]
SpongeBob: Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?
Patrick: Ready!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing] Welcome to our club! Welcome to our club! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squid...!
Squidward: SHUT YOUR HALF-WIT PIEHOLES!!! [grabs a stalk beside the one holding up the "Clubhouse" and pulls it while the other one is going down] I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club! [gets to the floor but the stalk snaps and the stalk holding up the "Clubhouse" flings back very fast and the "Clubhouse" flies off it. He starts screaming]
Nancy: Whoa!
Frank: Make a wish, honey.
[Squidward continues screaming. The "Clubhouse" falls into the Kelp Forest]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again! [they victory screech]
Squidward: Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!
Patrick: What happened?
[SpongeBob shrugs. Squidward runs around the "Clubhouse"]
Squidward: Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!
[SpongeBob and Patrick wave at Squidward who starts crying]
Squidward: Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery?!?! WHY-Y-Y-T?!
SpongeBob: Cheer up, Squidward, it could be worse.
Patrick: Yeah, you could be bald and have a big nose.
[camera zooms in on Squidward's head which deflates]
Squidward: Well... this is the end. [head falls on the ground]
SpongeBob: No it's not, Squidward!
Patrick: [building coffins] It's not?
SpongeBob: Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine! [patting Squidward's head] As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they do the victory screech again]
SpongeBob: And besides, we have this! [pulls out a conch shell]
Squidward: What's that?
Patrick: Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!
SpongeBob: Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? [pulls the string attached to the Magic Conch]
Magic Conch: Maybe someday.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling] Oooohhhh!
Squidward: You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.
Patrick: The shell knows all!
SpongeBob: Oh, Magic Conch Shell. What do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?
Magic Conch: Nothing.
Patrick: The shell has spoken!
Squidward: Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down doing nothing]
Squidward: [growls] I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!
[SpongeBob and Patrick still do nothing]
Squidward: [growls again] All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity! [starts walking away in the Kelp Forest] But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns... [laughs] sad... [laughs again] clowns. [laughs again. Later, he began to run fast and grew scared and started panting rapidly] What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost! [trips and falls] Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here! [sees light] Huh? Hhahahahahahaahhaa!! [he goes toward the light] I'm FREE!! Take that SpongeBob and Patrick!! Ahahaha!! Ahahaha!! [pumps fists in the air triumphantly but sees SpongeBob and Patrick; falls on the ground] Ohhh, there's no way out of here... [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick still doing nothing. A stick is thrown at Patrick's head. Squidward is putting a pan over a fire] How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight? [spots a bug running around so he steps on it] Ah... [puts the bug on the pan and walks over to SpongeBob and waves the pan over his nose] Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days. [walks over to Patrick] How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any. [walks away from Patrick] And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell! [shakes his butt in SpongeBob's face] If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam... [moves back to Club Squidward] that tells you nothing. [stirs the pan] As if the answers to all your problems will fall right out of the sky. Hahaha, fall right out of the sky! [camera switches to an airplane falling out of the sky]
Scooter: DUDE! We're falling right out the sky! We gotta drop the load! [presses the "Drop the Load" button. The airplane drops picnic supplies to where SpongeBob and Patrick are]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Praise the Magic Conch! [victory screech. Squidward stares shockingly. The bug gets up, hits him with the stick, and runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick eat. SpongeBob eats two hamburgers. Patrick eating a whole turkey in one bite. Now, when SpongeBob and Patrick are drinking, SpongeBob is drinking a can of soda and Patrick is drinking a bottle of ketchup. They laugh and Squidward goes to them]
Squidward: Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.
SpongeBob: It's a gift from the Magic Conch.
Squidward: Everything sure looks delicious. [gasps] Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite! [smells them but Patrick sucks them in and Squidward's nose too. He pulls his nose out] Uh, hey, uh, [laughs] SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um... [stammers] [While he is saying all this, SpongeBob is eating a cookie and is drinking a glass of orange juice]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: Umm...uh..yeah?
SpongeBob: Once a member, always a member!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [clink glasses] To the club! [victory screech]
Squidward: Yeah. [mimics the victory screech, weakly] Now, uh, if you'll excuse me... [runs to the table with all the food] All right... what shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?
SpongeBob: Why don't you ask... the magic conch, Squidward?
Squidward: Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.
[Squidward prepares to eat but SpongeBob and Patrick pull the table away and block it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.
Patrick: [whispering] Maybe he's not a brother.
[SpongeBob looks at Squidward wide-eyed]
Squidward: [chuckles] Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic. [takes the Magic Conch from SpongeBob] Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?
Magic Conch: Neither.
Squidward: Oh. Then how about the soup?
Magic Conch: I don't think so.
Squidward: [becomes annoyed] Could I have anything to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!
Patrick: [takes Magic Conch] Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch: No.
Patrick: Hmm... [happily] Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch: Yes.
Patrick: All right! [vacuums in the sandwich and burps] Sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: Give me that! [takes Magic Conch] Could I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Could I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Could I have something to eat!?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Can't you say anything else but no?!
Magic Conch: Try asking again.
Squidward: [asks excitedly with a grin on his face] Can I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: [in a very insulting, sarcastic-like tone] No!
[Squidward starts getting enraged.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you all right?
[Squidward shakes his head uncontrollably.]
Patrick: Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.
Kelp Forest Ranger: [offscreen] Hello? Anyone there? Hello? HELLO?! [he reveals himself after he cuts through the kelp. He gasps and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward dirty] Do you folks need some help?
Squidward: [gasps] I'm saved! [runs over to the forest ranger] You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!
Kelp Forest Ranger: Magic... Conch... Shell? [pulls out a Magic Conch Shell] You mean like this?! [says this while cross-eyed and having two big teeth]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they jump but they stop in midair] The Magic Conch! A club member!
Kelp Forest Ranger: [victory screech]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [victory screech]
Squidward: [dumbstruck] Uhhbuuuhhh...
Kelp Forest Ranger: My conch told me to come save you guys.
SpongeBob, Patrick and Kelp Forest Ranger: Hooray for the magic conches!
Kelp Forest Ranger: [we see Squidward in the background looking unhappy] All right, Magic Conch. What do we do now?
Magic Conch: Nothing.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger: All hail the Magic Conch! [they sit down doing nothing. Squidward, still dumbstruck, moves in between them]
Squidward: All hail the magic conch! [sits down with SpongeBob, Patrick, and the Kelp Forest Ranger]

[The episode begins with Squidward walking along the street]
Squidward: Maybe I'll do a cute little button. [Pulls his nose to give himself a button-nose. His nose pops out suddenly.] Or something a bit more manly perhaps. [pulls his nose hairs to create a mustache and a humanoid nose. His nose pops out back to normal suddenly] Upturned might be good, too. [Breathes in, puts his thumb into his mouth, and then blows. He gets an upturned nose. Just then, SpongeBob appears in his unicycle.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Great. [slaps himself] The idiot found me.
SpongeBob: Whatcha doing?
Squidward: I'm picking a nose.
SpongeBob: Ooh! I used to pick my nose too, until I finally cleared it out.
[SpongeBob lifts his nose and sticks his hand in it.]
Squidward: I'm not picking my nose, SpongeBob. I'm on the way to the hospital for a nose job. Plastic surgery. I'm finally gonna get the nose I should have been born with.
SpongeBob: [gasps] But, Squidward, you're a beautiful flower. You don't need to change a... [freaks out when he sees how hideously disgusting Squidward's nose is up close] Well, maybe a little work wouldn't hurt. Hey, you want a ride?
Squidward: With you? Absolutely not.
SpongeBob: Aww, come on, Squidward. [pedals off and comes back with a trashcan attached to his unicycle] I can get you there lickety-split.
[SpongeBob stuffs Squidward into the trashcan. Then he puts on a siren and pedals to the hospital at a fast pace, causing them to crash into the check-in desk.]
Nurse: You can't dump your garbage here, sir.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not garbage. That's my friend, Squidward. We're here to check in.
[SpongeBob removes the trashcan off of Squidward and his nose is covered with garbage.]
Nurse: Holy nostroly! You must be here for the nose job. Let's, uh, get your paperwork filled out.
[The scene changes to Squidward hooked up to the IV.]
Surgeon: You just relax, sir. The doctor will be ready for you soon.
Squidward: [inhales deeply] Ah. This is nice.
SpongeBob: Never fear, Squidward. Soon this dreary old room will be so full of well-wishing you'll never want to go home.
French Narrator: Five minutes later...
[Squidward's room is filled with balloons, teddy bears and get well cards.]
Squidward: [grunts as he pops out of his pile of teddy bears] SpongeBob, get this garbage out of here! I can hardly move!
SpongeBob: Oh, are you uncomfortable? Here, let me help.
[SpongeBob pushes the bed's buttons and the bed folds Squidward into the mattress. It also made Squidward get stuck into a teddy bear.]
Teddy Bear: I love you.
Squidward: [grunts as he rips the teddy off of him] The bed is fine!
SpongeBob: Fluff your pillow?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Fluff your IV bag?
[SpongeBob fluffs the IV bag, which makes Squidward's head buff up and down.]
Squidward: Enough, you buffoon!
SpongeBob: Well, gee, Squidward, I was just trying to be helpful.
Squidward: [sighs] If you want to help so badly, why don't you just go volunteer to be a candy striper? There's plenty of other people in the hospital you could torture.
SpongeBob: Squidward, that's a great idea. I was born to serve.
[SpongeBob runs out of the room. Squidward's bed folds up again.]
SpongeBob: Hello, lady, can I be a candy striper here at the—
Nurse: Grab a uniform out of the closet.
SpongeBob: Ooh, thank you! Thank you! Whoo! [runs into the closet and comes back out with a uniform] Ooh! Candy stripes. [slurps on the strips] Strawberry.
Purple Doctor: Ah, Doctor, thank goodness you're here.
Green Doctor: We were just looking for another physician to join us on our rounds.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and the doctors at a patient's room.]
Green Doctor: And what seems to be the problem today?
Catfish: [coughing] My throat hurts.
Purple Doctor: Prescribe him a numbing throat spray. Let's move on, shall we?
SpongeBob: Wait a second! I think I've seen this before. [rubs his finger all over the catfish and abstracts some filth] Mm, yeah. [licks the filth] Mm-hmm. I'll need one medical sea-chicken.
[The purple doctor takes a sea-chicken out of the first aid kit. SpongeBob plucks one of the feathers of the chicken, making it cluck in pain and places the chicken on the window but it falls down. SpongeBob tickles the catfish with the feather, which makes him cough up his keys.]
Catfish: Hey, my keys. And my throat feels better.
SpongeBob: You see, doctors, catfish are bottom feeders. The dirt on his face led me to believe he had recently eaten something that irritated his throat. Happens to my friend Patrick all the time. [grunts as he pulls out a pen, pencil and paintbrush from his head] Mm-hmm. [picks a pen and writes something down on a paper] Try a Krabby Patty next time, sir. They go down smooth, and they taste better than car keys.
Catfish: Thanks, doc.
SpongeBob: No need to thank me, sir. I'm here to help.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and the doctors at another patient's room.]
Purple Doctor: What treatment might you prescribe for this next patient, Doctor?
[The green doctor shows SpongeBob the x-ray of the patient's broken legs.]
Runner: So what do you think? Will I be able to run in the Bikini Bottom marathon next week?
Green Doctor: Oh, my, no. I'm afraid you're—
SpongeBob: Of course! Friends don't let friends miss marathons. We'll have you up in no time. [looks around and sees a skeleton] Ah!
[SpongeBob grabs the skeleton and lifts up the runner.]
Runner: What are you—
[SpongeBob shakes the broken bones out of the runner's body and stuffs the skeleton inside him.]
Purple Doctor: Most unorthodox.
Green Doctor: He's a genius.
[The runner appears to be good as new. Except that his head and feet are facing the wrong direction.]
Runner: Thanks, doc.
SpongeBob: Ready, set. [blows blowhorn as the runner runs out backwards]
[The scene changes to the doctors talking to Mrs. Puff hooked up to the iron lung.]
Green Doctor: And what seems to be your problem today, ma'am?
Mrs. Puff: Sometimes, I just don't have it in me to puff up under my own power.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: No! Not you! [whimpers] What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: [whispers] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'm a doctor...today. What is this crazy thing? Looks like some sort of weird submarine. [climbs through the iron lung]
Purple Doctor: You're kidding of course. We've placed her in an iron lung to help puff her back up.
SpongeBob: Ha-ha! Dive! Dive! Up periscope! Load the torpedoes. [imitates airplane]
Mrs. Puff: Huh?
[SpongeBob laughs but accidentally kicks the lever, making the iron lung move.]
Mrs. Puff: [whispers] Help me! [screams]
[The iron lung rolls down the hallway.]
Unnamed doctor: Hey!
[All the doctors and patients panic as the iron lung rolls through the hall, crashing into several people, including the runner in the process.]
Runner: My legs!
SpongeBob: Never fear, Mrs. Puff. I haven't lost a patient all day. [puts on medical goggles] Let's get medical.
[SpongeBob drives the iron lung with the levers, making Mrs. Puff get her puff back in shape. SpongeBob screams as he notices that he is about to crash into the windows. He tries to slow the machine down, but breaks the levers.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no.
[The iron lung crashes into the two windows, pushing Mrs. Puff out. Mrs. Puff inflates as her puff is now fully back in shape.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh. Actually, I feel like my old self again. But you still don't get a driver's license. [shrinks down to normal size and falls to the ground] Oh!
Purple Doctor: Wow. I've never seen anyone work an iron lung like that.
Green Doctor: So awesome.
[The two doctors high-five.]
Purple Doctor: We were on our way to perform a surgery...
Green Doctor: But we would be honored to watch you perform it.
SpongeBob: Me? Perform a surgery?
[Meanwhile at the operation theater, Squidward is getting ready for his nose job.]
Squidward: Oh, yeah, this is the life. And best of all, there's no SpongeBob here to ruin it.
[The two doctors and SpongeBob arrive in the operation theater.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy, surgery! And on my first day too.
Squidward: SpongeBob? No! What are you doing here?
Surgeon: Nighty night, Mr. Tentacles.
Squidward: Wait, wait, no, no, no, no!
[The surgeon puts Squidward to sleep with anesthesia.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, everybody.
Doctors and surgeons: Hi, SpongeBob.
Purple Doctor: Doctor, the patient's over here, and he's ready for you to begin.
Green Doctor: Oh, we're most eager to see which tool you select first.
SpongeBob: [looks for a tool] Hmm, mm—mm—mm—mm. Let me see. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Phew. [picks up a spatula] Here we go!
[SpongeBob twirls his spatula around for a few moments, impressing the doctors and surgeons.]
Doctors and surgeons: Oh! Ah!
[SpongeBob goes to do Squidward's nose job.]
SpongeBob: Okay, SpongeBob, this can't be too hard. Just make an incision here, and— [operates with the spatula and ink sprays up] no! Shoot! [the heart flips] Son of a gun! [continues to work, but breaks Squidward's foot off] Ah, my bad.
Surgeon: I'll take that. [takes the foot]
SpongeBob: Ah-ha! [chops with spatula and makes sushi] Mmm, sushi.
[The surgeon takes the sushi and SpongeBob pulls out a saw. SpongeBob performs the operation with a saw, but breaks it. SpongeBob gets creeped out when he notices that he just sawed Squidward in half. The surgeon moves Squidward's head to another bed where the rest of his body is being placed.]
SpongeBob: He's, uh, really going to pieces over this nose job.
[The doctors and surgeons laugh.]
SpongeBob: Oh, [chuckles] Thank you! Let's try again, shall we?
[SpongeBob resumes the operation and creates a patty with Squidward's tentacle in it.]
SpongeBob: Order up!
[The doctors and surgeons applaud and laugh. SpongeBob hops onto Squidward's bed and lifts his nose up. In the nostril, there's a blue ribbon in it.]
SpongeBob: Yow! That shouldn't be in there. [pulls ribbon and sees another one] Ooh! [pulls more ribbons out and a clipboard]
Yellow Doctor: What? [notices his clipboard is missing] Oh.
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[The doctors and surgeons applaud. SpongeBob is seen stitching Squidward's nose together.]
SpongeBob: Nurse, sponge.
[The surgeon clips part of SpongeBob's head and wipe the sweat off. The sponge jumps back into the place it was clipped off.]
SpongeBob: Thank you, nurse.
Gray Doctor: I can't see! I can't see! I want to see!
[The gray doctor jumps out of the window and falls into Squidward's nose.]
Gray Doctor: I still can't see.
[The gray doctor runs around to operating room, dragging Squidward all over the place. SpongeBob stops the gray doctor from running around and sends him flying back into the balcony with the spatula. The pink doctor catches the gray doctor with a catcher's mitt.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[The doctors and surgeons applaud. SpongeBob resumes the operation and gives the finishing touches.]
SpongeBob: There we go. You can wake him up now, nurse.
Squidward: [wakes up and groans] What—what happened?
SpongeBob: I finished your nose job, you silly goose. Take a look.
[SpongeBob pulls out a mirror and Squidward looks at his reflection. His nose appears to be bigger than it was before.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you idiot! This isn't even close to what I wanted!
SpongeBob: Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, nurse!
Squidward: Wait, no, no, no! I want a different doctor! I—
[The surgeon puts Squidward to sleep with anesthesia again. He wakes up again and looks at his reflection again. He has three noses instead of one.]
Squidward: No! [with a noisemaker] No! [with an elephant's trunk] No! [with clarinet] No! [with crabs nose] No! [with log] No! [with the face of Squilliam Fancyson] No! [with a reindeer's head] No! [with his house] No! [with real life octopus] No! [with car engine and it flares up] No-o-o-o! [sobbing]
[SpongeBob snaps his fingers. Squidward wakes up for the final time.]
Squidward: Stop! I don't want to change my nose anymore! SpongeBob, I'll do anything! Anything at—
SpongeBob: How's about the Squidward Classic?
[SpongeBob holds up the mirror and Squidward's nose is back to how it was.]
Squidward: Hey, not bad. This looks even better than my old nose.
SpongeBob: Well, I did have to use a few of your other body parts to re-sculpt it.
[Squidward appears to be missing his arms and legs.]
SpongeBob: D'oh! Look at the time. I have to go to work. [takes off his surgery outfit]
Purple Doctor: But you're a doctor. You're at work.
SpongeBob: No, I'm just a fry cook. [puts on Krusty Krab hat] But it was fun playing with you guys. Bye! [leaves]
Purple Doctor: Fry cook? Ooh. [faints in the green doctor's arms]
Squidward: Don't be afraid, ladies. This sinus Adonis is on the market.
[The two surgeons gasp and shiver.]


[The episode starts off with SpongeBob working at the Krusty Krab. Food items shaped into a picnic are put on the grill. SpongeBob starts speaking in their voices.]
Herb (SpongeBob): Sure is a nice day for a picnic.
Loretta (SpongeBob): Oh Herb! It's like a second honeymoon!
Herb (SpongeBob): Just look at Timmy and Sally throwing the old disc around!
Timmy (SpongeBob): C'mon and throw it, sis!
Sally (SpongeBob): I just wanna say I'm gonna be real sad when you go off to college.
[Sally plops onto the grill.]
Timmy (SpongeBob): Oh Sally, don't be such a goop! (SpongeBob appears, tears in his eyes) You know... I'll always be your big brother! [sniffles]
[SpongeBob starts crying and his tears start  dropping on the grill.]
Loretta (SpongeBob): Is it starting to rain?
Herb (SpongeBob): Nothing can spoil this perfect day!
Sally (SpongeBob): What's the matter big brother got something in your eye?
Timmy (SpongeBob): Yeah... that's it... that must be it...
Sally (SpongeBob): Ha haw, now who's the goof? Just watch out because here it comes!
[SpongeBob makes Sally throw the disc/pickle.]
Squidward: Oh, what now? Too much weeing. What is...
[The pickle lands in Squidward's face, causing Squidward not to see.]
Squidward: [screams] PICKLE JUICE! Oh, my eye!
[Squidward tries to grab something to make him see again, but instead picks up the hot sauce and squirts it in his eye. This causes his eye to catch fire.]
Squidward: [screams]
Mr. Krabs: I smell something burning.
Squidward: Yeah. Probably my eye.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, stop your drama, Squidward.
[Mr. Krabs blows the extinguisher in his face.]
Squidward: You missed a spot.
[Mr. Krabs flashes it in his face three times. He walks into the kitchen and sees what SpongeBob is doing. He then blows the extinguisher on Herb, Loretta, Timmy, and Sally.]
Mr. Krabs: What in the name of Neptune's tail fin is going on in here, boy?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm playing picnic with my wonderful little food friends Herb and Loretta! These are their kids Timmy and Sally.
Mr. Krabs: Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive.
SpongeBob: Like what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!
SpongeBob: At this point it would be ketchuping up the water.
Mr. Krabs: Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?
SpongeBob: Well, I could try. [scoops off the burnt patties and puts a new one on] Here's a little worker. We'll call him Pete.
Mr. Krabs: Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!
[Pete droops a bit.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!
SpongeBob: Maybe Pete is just tired.
Mr. Krabs: Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know Mr. Krabs. [sprays ketchup on the productivity chart] I guess it might affect his productivity-
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No! Not his productivity!
SpongeBob: Hey, maybe if Pete can go on a picnic like the Patty family, he might be rested and happy and more productive than ever!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!
SpongeBob: Hey! Maybe Pete's boss could have a company picnic and Pete could have a great time and relax and come back and work twice as hard!
Mr. Krabs: Company picnic?
[Pete comes back up.]
SpongeBob: See, look! He's already perking up!
Mr. Krabs: Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?
SpongeBob: Definitely!
Squidward: [opens door] What's going on in here?
Mr. Krabs:  Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob high-five each other and then the screen moves to the window and shows an eye that then goes back to The Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea.
[The scene changes to Jellyfish Fields and shows SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward sitting on toilet paper.]
Squidward: This is the greatest company picnic ever?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes it is.
SpongeBob: Pace yourself Squidward, the fun is just getting started.
Squidward: Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses.
[SpongeBob puts on a hat made out of toilet paper.]
SpongeBob: Here's one!
Squidward: Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here.
Mr. Krabs: Right you are! Here's the food! [points to a pile of condiment packs.]
Squidward: [picks up packet of mustard] What?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack. [bites a pack of mustard and opens it with his mouth.] See? You open it with your teeth. [puts mustard on a round piece of toilet paper.] There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around.
[Squidward holds the disk-shaped paper.]
Mr. Krabs: Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Going long!
Mr. Krabs: Ho, ho. This is so much fun.
[SpongeBob runs out far.]
SpongeBob: Is this far enough?
Mr. Krabs: I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!
[Mr. Krabs throws disk-shaped paper but ends up flying in Squidward's face, covering him with mustard.]
Mr. Krabs: [looks out] Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere.
[The disk-shaped paper with mustard slides off of Squidward's face.]
Squidward: I'm going home.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs Squidward] Oh no you're not. [sets him down] You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!
Squidward: [grumbles]
[SpongeBob comes back and sees Squidward's face smeared with mustard.]
SpongeBob: Oh boy! Facing painting! Great idea, Mr. Krabs. [licks some mustard from Squidward's face] Ahh. Here, let me try!
[SpongeBob grabs a pack of ketchup and opens it with his teeth. He turns around and does his make-over with the ketchup. He turns around again with the face of Barnacle Boy.]
SpongeBob: Hi, I'm Barnacle Boy.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, "This was the greatest..."
Squidward: Do not say it!
Mr. Krabs: "The greatest comp..."
Squidward: Don't!
Mr. Krabs: [a rainbow appears] "The greatest company picnic ever!"
[Suddenly, they hear loud music and a van is driving up towards them.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, looks like we've got company.
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs, it is a company picnic. [laughs]
Squidward: Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs nervously] I have? Wait. Oh yeah.
[The van drives past them and backs up.]
Mr. Krabs: [reads the license plate on the van] "Chumpany Picnic"? That's not how you spell "Company Picnic"!
Plankton: [honks the horn] Guess who?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton!
[Plankton hops out of the van.]
Mr. Krabs: Just what do ya think you're doin', Plankton?
Plankton: Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot.
Mr. Krabs: Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!
Plankton: Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day.
SpongeBob: [happy] Aww!
Mr. Krabs: You don't even have any employees!
SpongeBob: [sad] Aww!
Plankton: Sure I do.
[Two robots that resemble SpongeBob and Squidward pop out of the van.]
Plankton: Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around.
[Simmy throws the disk at Tally, but bounces back. They do it two times.]
SpongeBob: A real disk?
Mr. Krabs: Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!
SpongeBob: Well. Eh.
Plankton: You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all.
SpongeBob: Aw, no thanks, Plankton. We're having a great time at our own company picnic.
[Squidward is wrapped up in toilet paper and is being chased by jellyfish. Simmy and Tally placed a huge trunk in the middle of the ground.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton. What are Simmy and Tally up too?
Plankton: Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities.
[As Plankton talks, Simmy and Tally set up numerous things people see at a carnival.]
Plankton: The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies...
Squidward: Delicacies?
Plankton: And of course, the dunking booth!
[Tally throws the ball and Simmy gets dunked in the dunking booth. Simmy short-circuits and explodes. Plankton becomes worried.]
Plankton: [turns SpongeBob around] Have you seen the calliope?
[Tally plays the calliope.]
SpongeBob: Aww!
Mr. Krabs: Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display...
Squidward: One side, Goopy!
[Squidward runs past Mr. Krabs, which makes him spin around until his shell falls off. Seeing that he is naked, Mr. Krabs is embarrassed. Squidward gobbles up the cotton candy and roasted peanuts in a crazy frenzy.]
SpongeBob: Yum.
[Mr. Krabs struggles to get his shell back on.]
Mr. Krabs: Is this backwards? [grunts] Oh, that's not it either.
Plankton: You were saying, Krabs? [laughs]
SpongeBob: [angry] Mr. Krabs is right, Plankton. We're having lots of fun. Come on, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs manages to get his shell back on.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?
[SpongeBob zips Mr. Krabs' shell and they both leave. They sit back down to their picnic area. Then they see Squidward having fun on the world's most exciting roller coaster.]
SpongeBob: Who needs them? Right, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Squidward: [offscreen] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [holds up some condiments] You want me to paint your face?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know.
[SpongeBob sprays mayonnaise on Mr. Krabs' face.]
SpongeBob: Alright. I'm making you into, um, a ghost.
[SpongeBob makes a beard out of the mayonnaise on Mr. Krabs' face. However, the mayonnaise smelled terrible.]
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad.
SpongeBob: [eerily] Ooh. The ghost of mayonnaise bad! That really scares people.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. [laughs nervously]
[Tally holds a huge amount of cotton candy over Simmy.]
Simmy: Whoa! Stop! That is almost too much cotton candy!
[Tally drops the cotton candy on Simmy. Simmy short-circuits and explodes. Mr. Krabs wipes the mayonnaise off his face.]
Mr. Krabs: You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?
SpongeBob: No. Course not.
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure you don't want to?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I am staying right here at the Krusty Krab picnic!
Mr. Krabs: You sure?
SpongeBob: 100% sure, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!
[Mr. Krabs runs back to Plankton's company picnic and plays the games of chance wheel. As the wheel spins, his eyes spin. The wheel stops and Mr. Krabs wins a stuffed walrus from Tally. Then he played the game of knocking the bottles with the ball and wins a second stuffed walrus from Tally.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] You can never have too many!
Squidward: Whoo!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squiddie-bird!
[Squidward jumps off the roller coaster and runs with Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: Whoo! [picks up the mustard plate but drops it] Having lots of fun over here. I've got a plate! It's made of paper!
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs are having the time of their lives at Plankton's company picnic.]
SpongeBob: It's a paper plate. Whoo! [throws plate and drops it]
[SpongeBob hears Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton laughing together as they are having a fun time. SpongeBob thinks for a bit and realizes that the Krusty Krab company picnic isn't as fun as it seemed.]
SpongeBob: Well, if it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for me.
[SpongeBob decides to go and join the fun. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are laughing together.]
Squidward: I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees...
Plankton: Say no more, my friend. [holds out contract] If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh! [grabs the pen and contract] Me first! Me first!
Plankton: Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day.
Mr. Krabs: That's such great advice!
[Squidward sucks on the pen.]
Plankton: This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more! [laughs evilly]
[An angry SpongeBob appears next to Plankton, meaning that he heard everything Plankton said.]
SpongeBob: Ahem! Hello, Plankton!
Plankton: Uh oh.
[SpongeBob sees Mr. Krabs, who is about to sign Plankton's contract.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't sign it!
[SpongeBob pounces on Mr. Krabs and prevents him from signing the contract. However, his actions sends the pen flying.]
Mr. Krabs: My candied pen!
[The pen is hurling towards Simmy. SpongeBob, in slow motion, runs to Simmy.]
SpongeBob: [in slow motion] Simmy, look out! There's a candied pen heading straight for your eye due to my act of swatting it away without first considering the trajectory! Oh, I wish I could give my words out faster, but everything's in slow motion!
[The pen is about to hit Simmy.]
SpongeBob: [in slow motion] No!
[However, instead of hitting Simmy, it went through the robot. The pen lands on the ground and rolls to a projector. SpongeBob bangs on the projector, revealing that Simmy and Tally was just a trash can and a ball wash post.]
SpongeBob: Simmy and Tally are holograms? Then that means...
[The projector reveals that the world's most exciting roller coaster was actually a rotting corpse of a sea monster.]
Squidward: I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?
[The projector reveals that the food Squidward ate was just rotten chum. The projector also revealed that the pen he was sucking on was a caterpillar. Squidward freaks out and rubs his tongue in disgust. The projector reveals that the van Plankton drove on was an old broken down van. Mr. Krabs gasps in wonder what the stuffed walruses were. But nothing happens.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew! That was a cl...
[The projector reveals that the stuffed walruses were actually fish skeletons. Mr. Krabs screams in terror and the skeletons crumble to dust.]
Mr. Krabs: You saved me, boy. How did you do it?
SpongeBob: I guess my mind was all sharp from the relaxing fun I had at your company picnic, Mr. Krabs.
[Plankton walks up to them.]
Plankton: Unbelievable!
[Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton.]
Plankton: Uh oh.
[Mr. Krabs puts Plankton on the disk-shaped paper with mustard and throws him out in the distance. Once it landed, there was an explosion.]
SpongeBob: [jumps up as a rainbow appears and jellyfish fly around] The greatest company picnic ever!
Mr. Krabs: Alright, enough relaxin'. Back to work! [laughs as he leaves]
[The episode ends with SpongeBob still being in the air and an angry Squidward gets stung in the head by a jellyfish.]


[The scene shows the Chum Bucket. Inside SpongeBob, Plankton, and Karen are in line doing the conga and laughing in a party-looking setting.]
Plankton: More fruit punch, SpongeBob?
[Karen gets SpongeBob a glass of fruit punch.]
SpongeBob: You know, Plankton, when you invited me over, I thought it was another trick to get the Krabby Patty formula. Now, I see you just love social gatherings in the workplace!
[SpongeBob drinks the fruit punch.]
Plankton: Oh, I love office parties. We got roller chair races and karaoke. Hey! I know a gag we can do. Copy our faces on the new copy machine!
[SpongeBob looks at the copier.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! Should I put my face on the glass?
Plankton: Why don't you lay your whole body down? That glass is big enough.
SpongeBob: How's this? Like this? What about this? Is this good?
Plankton: Just lay face-down and keep still. [clicks "SCAN"]
SpongeBob: [Laughs]
Plankton: Alright. Party's over. Go home!
SpongeBob: Aw...But I'd like some more fruit punch.
Plankton: No more punch for you! You don't look so good, SpongeBob. I suggest you take the day off tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Nah! I feel fine!
Plankton: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: Now that you ask, I don't know. [feels a twinge] I think I just felt a twinge!
Plankton: You'll be fine if you take tomorrow off. [Slams the door. The scene returns to the copier. Plankton clicks "PRINT." A copy of SpongeBob is printed from the copier. Plankton squirts a drop of toner. The SpongeBob copy comes to life.] Hello, SpongeBob CopyPants. Can you say "Secret formula"?
SpongeBob Copy: Se.. Se... for mama.
Plankton: "Se-cret Form-ula".
SpongeBob Copy:  Se-cret Form-ula. Secret formula!
[The SpongeBob copy and Plankton both laugh evilly. Scene cuts to Plankton making a tie for CopyBob]
Plankton: Now, remember. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and your assignment is to ask Krabs for the secret Krabby Patty formula.
SpongeBob Copy: My name is SpongeBob SquarePants, and I want the secret formula.
Plankton: Excellent! Now, off you go! Wait! [He colors the white tie with a blue marker.] Just keeping track of my copy.
[The copy walks into the Krusty Krab humming. The real SpongeBob is humming the same tune, but gets stopped by Plankton.]
Plankton: What are you doing here?! You said you would take today off.
SpongeBob: But I feel great today.
Plankton: Are you sure? Because you're sweating. [Scene shows SpongeBob in a pot of fire. SpongeBob walks away but Plankton bursts over.]
Plankton: But you can't work. You have yellow jaundice!
SpongeBob: [Laughs] Oh, Plankton. Yellow is my natural color. [Goes into Krusty Krab. Scene shows the copy putting on a Krusty Krab hat.]
SpongeBob Copy: Morning.
Squidward: Whatever. [The real SpongeBob comes doing the same thing]
SpongeBob: Morning.
Squidward: I said "Whatever." [Shocked] Wait, didn't I just... didn't I...[Looks behind the window as there is two SpongeBobs.]
Both SpongeBobs: Ooh. [Both laugh]
Squidward: There's only one explanation. I'm still in my bed and I'm having a nightmare! [Starts beating himself up.] Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! [A short customer enters]
Short customer: I'd like to place an order for two.
Squidward: Two, as in Two SpongeBobs? Sure, this is all just a bad dream, right? I'm dreaming and you're in my dream!
Short customer: That's me: The man of your dreams. [Walks away]
Squidward: If this is a dream. there are no consequences. I can do anything! [He pushes a cup of soda off the cash register but it's floating in the air.] I really am dreaming! [Scene shows a kid with a propeller hat making the cup fly. Scene cuts to the SpongeBobs.]
SpongeBob: What's your name, handsome stranger?
SpongeBob Copy: My name is SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: [Surprised] Wow! We look alike and have the same name! That's two things we have in common! [Both laugh] I always wanted a twin brother! [Turns into a bubble shape of himself] How do you feel about bubbles?
SpongeBob Copy: I love them! [The real SpongeBob turns into a jellyfish]
SpongeBob: Jelly fishing?
SpongeBob Copy: The same thing you do. [The real SpongeBob turns his face into the form of Squidward's face.]
SpongeBob: How about Squidward?
SpongeBob Copy: Oh, please. [Both laugh]
SpongeBob: I think I'll nickname you... Me two! [Both laugh again. Plankton goes into SpongeBob Copy's ear.]
Plankton: Hey, SpongeCopy. Good to see ya. [Whispers] Have you learned the secret formula yet?
Me Two: Oh, I can't tell you that. It's a secret. By the way, my name is Me Two.
Plankton: Me Two? I'm such a deep sea dope! Now that the copy's gone in contact with the original SpongeBob, he won't tell me the formula. [Me Two launches Plankton into Mr. Krabs' office.] Time to adjust my plan. [Mr. Krabs appears.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute! I can't afford two SpongeBobs! If this a scheme to collect two paychecks, forget about it! You're getting one paycheck split in two.
Both SpongeBobs: You are too good to us, Mr. Krabs. [Bubble transitions to Chum Bucket and comes to the copier]
Plankton: [laughs] Karen, did you know you're married to a genius?
Karen: How could I forget? [Scene shows a tattoo of Plankton on Karen's hard drive] You had it tattooed on my hard drive.
Plankton: Now where was I? Oh, yeah, I saved SpongeBob digital DNA. [Clicks "Print" again. Another sponge appears. Plankton squirts another drop of toner and the sponge comes alive. Plankton laughs.]
SpongeBob Copy: Ooh. [Eats Plankton]
Karen: No, no, SpongeCopy. We don't put dirty, nasty things in our mouth. Spit it out. [The copy spits Plankton out.]]
Plankton: Yuck! Now listen. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and you're to go straight to Mr. Krabs [whispering] and ask him for the secret formula.
SpongeBob Copy: Mr. Krabs, secret formula. Got it.
Plankton: And stay away from any other SpongeBobs!
SpongeBob Copy: Got it! [Eats Plankton again]
Karen: Ah! Ah! SpongeCopy! [Spits Plankton on the floor]
Plankton: You see, this is why I never had children.
[Scene transitions to Squidward looking at the SpongeBobs. One is eating ketchup and the other is juggling Krabby Patties.]
Squidward: Yup. I'm still dreaming. [To a customer] Hello, there. Are you enjoying my dream? [Slams his patty on the ground] I heard you like your patties "Ground"! [Laughs and goes over to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Mr. Squidward! Just what the devilfish do you think your doing?!
Squidward: Isn't it obvious, you red-faced tightwad? I'm dreaming! [Pulls down Mr. Krabs' pants] What's that under there?
Mr. Krabs: Under where?
Squidward: That's right. [Kicks Mr. Krabs into his office] ♪I don't care, I don't care, none of this is real.♪ Hmm, I always wanted to fly and since this is my dream, I'm going to fly! [Copy enters Krusty Krab and goes into Mr. Krabs's office.]
SpongeBob Copy: Hello, Mr. Krabs. Hey, can you tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula?
Mr. Krabs: You want me tell you the formula? That's quite a responsibility, laddy.
SpongeBob Copy: Secret formula.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you make a good point. Lean in boy! [Plankton is looking at them]
Plankton: He's doing it. He knows the formula. I can taste triumph! Wait, no! No!
SpongeBob Copy: Secret formula. Secret formula. Secret formu...
SpongeBob: Hey, look. Another handsome devil. [laughs] We'll call you Me Three [laughs again] Aww. Let's go flip some patties.
Plankton: Neptune's puddle! Now that SpongeBob's been corrupted by the other 2! What I need is a legion of Bobs. A full-lined blitz cream of Bobs. [Scene bubble transitions to Plankton playing a snare drum as a million copies of SpongeBob walk out of the Chum Bucket.] March! March, my pretties, and learn the formula!
SpongeBob Copies: Secret Formula. Secret Formula.
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! You guys are multiplying faster than me moneys! Alright, pipe down! I'm only going to tell you the secret formula one more time!
SpongeBob copies:  One more time! [all leave the office]
Mr. Krabs: So you've all memorized the formula. Now get to work! I have to calculate paychecks.
SpongeBob copies: Yay! Hooray!
Plankton: They all know the formula!
One SpongeBob Copy: Let me do that!
SpongeBob: Okay. Thanks.
[SpongeBob walks towards the mop, another copy pops out of the bucket.]
Another SpongeBob Copy: Let me do that!
SpongeBob: Sure.
Another SpongeBob copy: I'll polish the pickles.
SpongeBob:  [To Me Two] Looks like you sponges have everything covered.
Me Two:  Mm hmm. [Turns into light gray hue]
SpongeBob: Hey, you don't look so good. Can I take you home? Where do you live?
Me Two: I came from the Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob: The Chum Bucket?
Plankton: ♪I'm going to know the formula! I'm going to know the formula...♪
SpongeBob: Plankton! Me Two says you made him in a copy machine, so that you could steal the secret formula.
Plankton: Uh, well, that's pattonly ridiculous!
Me Two: Uhh...
SpongeBob: You got to help him! I think he's sick or something.
Me Two: I feel funny. [Vanishes]
SpongeBob: Me Two! Me Two! Oh! What happened to him?!
Plankton: I was afraid of that. I thought I'd save some money by using cheap toner.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Plankton: It means my plan is ruined! All the SpongeBob copies will fade away now!
SpongeBob: Fade away? All my brand new friends?! Nooooooooo! They can't! [Talking to Me Three] No! Don't disappear! [He disappears right after he says that. He cries.]
Plankton: Quickly, man! Before you fade, what's the formula?!
SpongeBob Copy: It's easy. You take one par... I don't feel so good [Disappears]
Plankton: Wait, no! [Each time he goes near a copy, he says The formula but then each copy disappears. Scene cuts to a bunch of other copies cleaning the roof, mowing the lawn, and some other things but they disappear. Then the scene cuts to Patrick playing with some of the copies but they disappear also.]
Patrick: Life is but a walking shadow. Ha-lube-lube-lube-lube-lube... [Stopped because he gets hit by a lawnmower and gets split into 9 mini copies of himself. Scene transitions to Plankton running over to the final copy.]
Plankton: What's the formula?! [Mr. Krabs enters.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I did it. I calculated 1 paycheck down into 300 separate tiny checks. Only one of you left? Here.
[The copy vanishes]
Plankton: Geez, what a cheapskate. [exits the Krusty Krab] I can't believe I failed again!
SpongeBob: [appears in front of Plankton] I can believe it.
Plankton: Wait, are you a copy?! Quick! What's the formula?!
SpongeBob: Well, you see, it's... [reveals his red tie] Nice try, Plankton. But I'm the O.S. The original sponge. [Grins, then frowns] I can't believe they're all gone.
Plankton: You wouldn't want all those copies of you around. They were just imitations anyway.
SpongeBob: Hey, those imitations were my friends.
Plankton: One SpongeBob is more than the world can handle anyway. You're a unique snowflake.
SpongeBob: Yeah, thanks, Plankton. Things did get a bit out of hand with all those me's around.
Plankton: Yeah, you're pretty annoying. Well, you can stomp on me now if that's you want.
SpongeBob: Plankton, I'm a unique snowflake, and snowflakes don't stomp. They skip. [He skips off-screen, laughing]
Plankton: Well, what do you know about that. No comeuppance!
Squidward: Gaining speed, increasing thrust, raising nose, air pressure on tentacles, stray tables in right position, and liftoff!
Plankton: Eh, spoke too soon. Comeuppance in three, two... [Gets crushed by Squidward] OW! Right on my keys!
[Episode ends]


[No customers are at the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs is holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, Squidward is reading a ballet magazine and imagining his head on the dancers, and SpongeBob is wiping dust off tables.]
[Closer shot of Mr. Krabs holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, attempting to retain his smile. Piece of paper flies through the open door of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?! [Squidward is dancing] Squidward!
Squidward: Uh-uh... Yes, sir?
Mr. Krabs: There's gonna be some changes around here. [Francis walks in. Mr. Krabs gasps] A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab! [runs up to Francis with a chair and seats him. Brings him back to the table] SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up.
SpongeBob: Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?
Francis: All I wanted was change for the payphone. [shows the dollar]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir! [runs off quickly and comes back with change. Talking in a French accent] Monsieur's change. [snaps his fingers]
Francis: Thanks. [laughs nervously and leaves a penny on the table] Here you go. [runs off as Mr. Krabs smells the penny]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah! [jumps on it. Later, Mr. Krabs' puts the penny away in his safe in his office and is with Squidward and SpongeBob] Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month. [pulls down a chart with zig-zag lines going down and his eyes sticking out on each side] We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers. [pulls the chart up] Do you lubbers have any ideas?
SpongeBob: I've got one! [takes out a tray with a soda and a pair of socks on it] A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams... [talks with mouth full of clams] ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment. [Squidward gasps]
Squidward: That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me! [runs up to Mr. Krabs with stars in his eyes] This is the moment I've... [eyes return to normal] I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.
Mr. Krabs: The money? [Squidward is lying on the table]
Squidward: And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs looks at his picture of him and Pearl] Little Pearly... a star?
SpongeBob: Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks! [runs off as Squidward and Mr. Krabs shake hands]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you've got a deal. Make my little girl a star! [later, the restaurant is being redecorated for the show. Squidward is writing notes on a notepad.]
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, what time am I going on?
Squidward: Going on what?
SpongeBob: The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!
Squidward: What talent could you possibly possess? [SpongeBob blows a big bubble which turns into a hippo. Then blows two small bubbles for the hat and cane. Both dance]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! [Squidward yawns]
Squidward: No one, not even your parents, would want to see that. [hippo bubble pops] What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.
SpongeBob: Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!
Squidward: I can hardly wait. [SpongeBob runs off] Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes. [laughs] Tennis shoes. I crack myself up. [now the night of the talent show where people are outside conducting interviews and people inside are talking and getting set-up]
Lisa: [Talking in the background] We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town...
SpongeBob: [peeks out from behind the curtain] Wow! A full house! [gasps] There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud! [Mr. Krabs shakes Mr. SquarePants' hand]
Mr Krabs: Hello, I'm Mr. Krabs, and I like money.
SpongeBob: I gotta get ready! [Squidward gets everyone's attention]
Squidward: Alright, people, listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop. [performers gather around] Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it's not. It's mine.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squid! How about this for the show? [runs off and runs back with a tub full of water and the words 'Mister Absorbency' written on the front] The Amazing Mister Absorbency! [puts his finger in the water and absorbs it. Absorbs the water into his legs] Ta-da! [absorbs water into his head] Ta-da!
Squidward: No one is going to watch you engorge yourself. [grabs Squidward's legs]
SpongeBob: Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!
Squidward: So you really want to be in the show?
SpongeBob: Oh, yes!
Squidward: Okay, you get to mop up afterwards. [hands SpongeBob a mop] Now will you stop bugging me? [walks off]
SpongeBob: So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! [show starts and crowd applauds. Squidward comes out and gets the cue cards that are in his tuxedo]
Squidward: Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home. [Patrick laughs] Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well. [Patrick laughs again] Put your fins together for... [Patrick cracks up laughing very hard. Bashes on the table with laughter, shaking dinnerware. He falls off his chair] Put your... [Patrick laughs] Put... [Patrick laughs] Pearl. [crowd claps as curtain rises for Pearl, dressed in cheerleader uniform]
Mr. Krabs: Hooray! My little girl is finally a star.
Pearl: Give me a K-R-U! [jumps up and down on the stage causing the crowd to fly up and down with her] Give me a S-T-Y! [jumps up and down again] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down]
Mr. Krabs: [He, Patrick, and SpongeBob's parents get tossed up and down. Mr. Krabs appear happy.] That's what I call talent! [Krusty Krab floor is destroyed]
Pearl: Thank you!
Fred: My leg! Ugh!
Pearl: Thank you, thank you! [Squidward closes curtain and as he is lowering the rope, SpongeBob is tied to it holding a mop and a bucket of water.]
Squidward: [Screams in shock]
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, listen. What do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side. [Squidward lets the rope go and sends SpongeBob flying up. Then he walks back out on the stage]
Squidward: And now, poetry. [walks backstage but peeks his head through the curtain] By Gary. [curtain opens. Gary is on a stool]
Gary: [clears throat] Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
Sandy: He has such a way with words.
Squidward: [checks his watch] Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me! [SpongeBob walks up]
SpongeBob: Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?
Squidward: Yes. [audience applauds as curtain opens, revealing Plankton in a magician costume and a sign that says 'The Amazing Plankton!']
Plankton: I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation... [turns his wand into flowers] ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes. [throw the flowers aside] First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience. [jumps onto a table and grabs the Krabby Patty from the customer. Runs toward the door, but Mr. Krabs stops Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Nice try. Your act's over, bub. [grabs the patty]
Plankton: You may win this time. She-hah-kazing! [he claps his hands and ignites into a mini-explosion. The smoke from the explosion clears and he is completely charred] Well, this stinks. [he walks off and is booed. Mr. Krabs runs up to Squidward backstage, leaving a trail of flames]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! [Literally races towards him, like an overspeeding race car] This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!
Squidward: Now, now, don't you worry, Mr. Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.
Mr. Krabs: For your sake, I hope you're right. [bunch of spot lights gleam around Krusty Krab]
Squidward: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward! ['Squidward Live' words blink in pink and green lights. Curtain opens and the background shows a canyon. Squidward dances with birds, accompanied by classical music. Then the lights go dark and music becomes techno as Squidward dances weirdly. Makes weird noises as he dances after the first part of his dance.]
Fish: What the?!
[Squidward continues to dance weirdly. Crowd boos and pelts tomatoes at Squidward]
Mr Krabs: I'm losing money on this deal! [puts a $1.00 sticker over the free sign on the salad bar. Grins.]
Fred: It's worth every penny. [everyone runs up to Mr. Krabs with dollar bills in hand]
Squidward: You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!
Crowd: No talent! No talent! No talent! [curtain closes]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, can I go on now?
Squidward: Yeah, show's over! [crown continues booing as SpongeBob walks out and mops up the tomatoes. Crowd gets interested in this and applauds at him]
Crowd: Hey, yeah. That's really not bad. I like that. Alright! [SpongeBob briefly stops mopping and the crowd becomes silent. He then starts mopping faster getting even more applause. He then leaves stage right and the applause stops. He peeks from where he left and mops the floor while leaving stage left which starts the applause again. He waves goodbye to the crowd] We want more! We want more! We want more! We want—
Squidward: They want an encore! [pushes SpongeBob away] Stand aside, SpongeBob! [Squidward jumps out and the crowd grows silent. He goes backstage and SpongeBob comes back out mopping and crowd cheers again. SpongeBob leaves stage left as Squidward jumps out again and the crowd instantly becomes silent again. Squidward is angry.]
[Squidward goes backstage and grabs SpongeBob. Then shows the crowd SpongeBob and they cheer. Then he puts his own head through the curtain and the crowd goes silent.]
[SpongeBob's arm gets a cheer, but Squidward's does not. SpongeBob's leg is shown then curtain rises and SpongeBob is mopping. Curtain closes then opens to reveal Squidward mopping and the crowd goes silent.]
[Squidward stops and he is angry. He tries to mop somewhere else to impress them. He then raises his hands up in a ta-da moment, but someone in the crowd throws a tomato and SpongeBob sweeps it up as the crowd cheers. Backstage, Harold and Margaret SquarePants bring Mr. Krabs up in a wheelbarrow full of cash.]
Mr. Krabs: You did it, Squidward! What a great show!
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, my son's a star!
Mr. SquarePants: Who ever knew he had such talent.
Mr. Krabs: I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show! [crowd throws flowers at SpongeBob]


[Squidward is hoeing his garden, SpongeBob's clock rings]
Squidward: [sighs] Let the madness begin.
SpongeBob: It's [he comes out on his unicycle] driving test day!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [sees his basket full] Thanks?
SpongeBob: Don't wish me luck, Squidward, I don't need it. [SpongeBob rides on unicycle, then folds it in suitcase and sits in a boat to Mrs. Puff] What do you say, Mrs. Puff? Let's get this party started. [SpongeBob crashes between in boats, and Mrs. Puff swelled] I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff, I know what I did wrong. [SpongeBob again crashes between in boats, and Mrs. Puff more swelled] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, I got it this time.
Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, not again. [SpongeBob again crashes in boat, and his boat goes up] Oh no! We're airborne!
SpongeBob: Yeah. It's a good thing too. One more crash and you would've popped for sure. Here, let me take that wheel.
Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob! Don't touch that! Oh, dear!
[Boat crashes into a tower, and an explosion occurs]
[Mrs. Puff wakes up in the hospital].
SpongeBob: Hey, Mrs. Puff. How are you feeling?
Mrs. Puff: [deflated] Oh my. What happened to me?
Purple Doctorfish: I'm afraid you've had a serious accident. [Pulls down a slide showing the inside of a pufferfish] It seems when you crashed, you ruptured your inflation sack. [Pokes the pufferfish and pops it making it deflate].
Mrs. Puff: Oh no! Will I ever be my old self again?
Purple Doctorfish: [Flips over paper on clipboard] Umm no, my dear, I'm afraid you'll never puff again.
Mrs. Puff: [Gasps].
SpongeBob: Hm, from now on, I guess we'll have to call you Mrs. Pop! [Laughs]
Mrs. Puff: [Growls and the images of SpongeBob in her eyes explode then leaps at SpongeBob holding holding his nose].
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff! What are you doing!?
Mrs. Puff: This is all your fault!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry! Stop, Mrs. Puff! [Laughs] That tickles!
Mrs. Puff: Why can't you just graduate out of my life?! Oh. Ohh.[Falls down].
Purple Doctorfish: [Holding a needle] There! That should help her relax.
SpongeBob: Sheesh! I don't know what she is so upset about! [Puts arm around Purple Doctorfish] I think she looks better this way! If I always say, it's duh doy. [Also falls out].
Purple Doctorfish: [Holding a second needle] Yes. Everyone needs to relax.
[Bubble transition back to the hospital].
SpongeBob: [Holding flowers then knocks on Mrs. Puff's room door and opens it] Hello, Mrs. Puff. Are we feeling any better?
Mrs. Puff: [Growls]
SpongeBob: I see you got the flowers I sent.
Mrs. Puff: Yes. I'm allergic to them and you!
SpongeBob: Ah, this room is so dark and depressing! [Walks over to the window] You need sunlight! [Opens the window causing the sunlight to burst in also causing the flowers in the room to bloom].
Mrs. Puff: [Sneezes, then inflates but quickly deflates] Ouch.
SpongeBob: [Pushing a wheelchair] Come on, Mrs. Puff! You need to get out of this stuffy, old room!
Mrs. Puff: I'm not leaving this bed! [Gets lifted off the bed and onto the wheelchair] Whoa!
SpongeBob: Up and at 'em! [Pushing Mrs. Puff down the hall] Y'know what will make you feel better, Mrs. Puff? A nice peaceful stroll! [Whistles, but then the alarm goes off noticing doctors pushing people on wheelchairs].
Male Doctor: Clear the way! Injured coming through!
[Another doctor pushes a guy on a bed and the head Doctor gets stopped by SpongeBob].
SpongeBob: Excuse me! Doctor! What's up with those guys?
Purple Doctorfish: Oh, it's nothing serious. Just a caluty from this week's Demolition Derby! Come check out the carnage! It's actually quite entertaining.
[SpongeBob pushes Mrs. Puff to the window and notices a bunch of guys crashing into each other].
Purple Doctorfish: Pretty gruesome, huh? You gotta hand it to those guys! Risking their lives for our amusement!
Mrs. Puff: [thinking] Risking their lives for our amusement? [Has a thought bubble of SpongeBob getting crashed by four guys then dying. Still talking in thoughts] I could finally be rid of SpongeBob! [Spoken] Forever! Ha ha! And I mean that in the worst possible way! [Laughs evily].
SpongeBob: What's so funny?
Mrs. Puff: I just thought of a way that you could earn extra credit!
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Mrs. Puff: [Evil look] Yes, hooray indeed!
[Bubble transition to the Demolition Derby].
Mrs. Puff: [Laughing and comes out of the office with SpongeBob and a fish] So what do you say Captain Lutefisk? Will you enter him in the derby? For old times sake?
Captain Lutefisk: Well, Puff old girl! I wouldn't be I am today without your driving school. [Walks over to SpongeBob] But I don't know. He looks kinda soft. [Pushes down on SpongeBob's head].
Mrs. Puff: Looks can be deceiving! Observe! Here SpongeBob [Takes out a steering wheel] Hold this. [Gives SpongeBob the steering wheel and he suddenly starts to "drive" off and crashes].
Captain Lutefisk: Whoa-oa-oa! That kid's a natural! [SpongeBob returns and stops "driving"] But he's going to need a scarier identity. Derby's all about image! [Snaps] [Takes off shoe then sock and uses a pair of scissors and starts cutting up the sock and puts it on SpongeBob's head].
SpongeBob: Look out, extra credit! Here I come!
Mrs. Puff: Heh heh, yes! "Extra credit!" [Laughs evily].
[Bubble transition to a crowd cheering in a stadium].
Captain Lutefisk: Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Demolition Derby! Allow me to introduce our contestants! [Camera switches to a giant, musclar purple in a shark-like boat] First off, fegin of crossing guards everywhere: The Kruncher! [Crowd cheers for The Kruncher] And from the darkest depths of the brivin' blue: Divin' Bell Dale! [Divin' Bell Dale pounds his chest] And of course, you know and admire: Blow Torch! [Blow Torch breathes out fire] And the funniest driver of all: The Cackling Cruiser! (The Cackling Crusier laughs) Now with introductions out of the way...[Notices SpongeBob drive up between the Kruncher and Blow Torch]...Oh! I almost forgot! (Laughs) The Squish!
The Kruncher: Hey, Le Squish looks pretty "tough." [Looks down at SpongeBob] Maybe we should give up now.
[The Kruncher and Blow Torch laugh alongside the crowd which then Mrs. Puff shows up laughing maniacally].
Captain Lutefisk: Ok drivers! Start yer engines! And let the destruction begin! [Waves flag].
[The Kruncher, Blow Torch, Divin' Bell Dale, and The Cackling Cruiser all drive off. Then The Kruncher then readies to crash into SpongeBob].
Mrs. Puff: I can't look! Wait, yes I can!
SpongeBob: [Notices the Kruncher driving at him] Ah! [The Kruncher ends of driving into SpongeBob's mouth which causes him to stop in mid air].
The Kruncher: What the hay? [Gets send crashing into the wall by SpongeBob].
Mrs. Puff: What? This is not going well...
SpongeBob: Huh? [Notices Divin' Bell Dale driving toward him] Oh, dear. I think I'm in that fellow's way. [Turns the key as Dale gets closer] Engage turn signals.[Turns on turn signals as Dale gets even closer] Adjust mirrors.[Adjusts mirros as Dale is even closer now] Hands at ten and two, and finally floor it. [Laughs and the back wheels on his boat spin fast causing dirt to fly at Dale's helmet which blinds him].
The Kruncher: [Drives out of hole in the wall] Oh, what happened? [Notices Dale swerving around and he eventually crashes into him].
Mrs. Puff: What is wrong with you guys?! Squash the Squish! [Notices Blow Torch ramming SpongeBob into the air] Yes!
Blow Torch: [Laughs and snorts].
[SpongeBob flies out and back into the water and one of his back wheels land on Blow Torch's face. SpongeBob then pushes the gas pedal causing him to literally run off Blow Torch's face].
Captain Lutefisk: Oh! Ooh! Le Squish turns it around with a rare face trend maneuver!
Mrs. Puff: [Cries].
SpongeBob: [Notices all of the drivers surround him] Mrs. Puff! What should I...
Mrs. Puff: Why... are you still... ALIVE?!
SpongeBob: Put her in drive? Thanks, Mrs. Puff, you're the best!
[SpongeBob tires to put it in drive the The Cackling Cruiser crashes into him from behind, but he bounces off the wall and back into the Cruiser causing him to crash into the wall and his wheels fall off. SpongeBob goes flying over The Kruncher who then crashes into The Cackling Cruiser. SpongeBob then avoids Blow Torch, Divin' Bell Dale, and some unknown driver which they all end up driving into a fish on a boat. All of the wreckage start flying by Mrs. Puff and the crowd which they look in awe].
Mrs. Puff: Curse you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [Still driving] What's that Mrs. Puff? [About the drive into Blow Torch].
Blow Torch: [Laughs] I got you this time! [SpongeBob ends up driving up the front on his boat and then Blow Torch crashes. SpongeBob goes flying back in the other direction].
Mrs. Puff: This is it! Ha ha! Yes! Huh?
[SpongeBob ends up on top of the wreckage still intact. The crowd then cheers for him].
Mrs. Puff: If you want someone demolished, I guess you have to demolish them yourself! [Pushes down Fred and appears in a giant monster boat wearing a helmet and jump suit] Not so fast! There's one more challenger! I'm The Huff! [Drives toward SpongeBob then at the crowd which she starts to drive away from the derby. She then notices the crowd on her windshield] You're blocking my view! [Turns on the windshield wipers and knocks the people off her windshield. Then she continues to pursue SpongeBob laughing evily as they drive back to her boating school. They start driving around the course] Hah hah hah! Huh? [She and SpongeBob drive right into the classroom destroying it in the process].
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff! It's you! [Mrs. Puff then inflates] And you're all "puffy" again! Now everything's back to normal!
[The entire building then collaspes on them].
Mrs. Puff: Yes, perfectly normal.


[The episode begins with Bikini Bottom news.] 
Johnny Elaine: This is a Bikini Bottom News special report. [the screen shows Perch Perkins at the Bikini Bottom power plant with the police] Perch?
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here at the Bikini Bottom power plant, where the evil supervillain known as the Dirty Bubble has finally been cornered by police!
[The Dirty Bubble is at the very top of the power plant, holding the police chief hostage.] 
Dirty Bubble: Stand back, coppers, and cease your attack, or I'll make your police chief my late night snack! [laughs and holds the chief in the air with his tongue] 
Police chief: Do what he says! [groans as the Dirty Bubble squeezes him tighter] 
Perch Perkins: [appears from the left] Will the grime of this evil soap globe wash over our fair city? Or will the law force him to clean up his act? 
Dirty Bubble: [releases the police chief and grabs Perch] Or will he choose door number three, and devour a newsman live on TV? [laughs as he goes to eat Perch] 
[Just then, three officers seize the Dirty Bubble with giant bubble wands.] 
Officer Slugfish: Drop him, airhead! 
[The officers force the Dirty Bubble to let Perch go.] 
Perch Perkins: Yipe! [falls off-screen] 
Officer Johnson: [grunts while seizing the Dirty Bubble] I got him! 
[The officers shove the Dirty Bubble into the bottle.] 
Dirty Bubble: Remember this face and remember it well, so you'll recognize me when I see you in—[gets pushed into the bottle by the chief] 
Police chief: Jail! 
[The Dirty Bubble, still in the bottle, is placed in a prison cell in Bikini Bottom Jail.] 
Johnny: Six months later... 
[Two men carry the bottle containing the dirty bubble inside. One man opens the bottle, takes out the bubble wand, dips it into the liquid and blows out the Dirty Bubble, now sparky clean and reformed.] 
Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I feel like a new bubble. [laughs] 
Warden: Remember, Bubble, keep it clean, or you'll get mean. [gives the Clean Bubble a handshake] 
Clean Bubble: Thank you, warden. I promise I won't let you down! [puts on his hat] 
Warden: [holds out a paper with KK on it] Here's the address of your new job. [gives the paper to the Clean Bubble and blows him away with a fan]
Clean Bubble: I'll make you proud, warden. Stay clean or you'll get mean. A new life. No more dirt, and no more wrong turns. [crashes into the Krusty Krab sign] The Krusty Krab. Hm, this must be the place! [enters the restaurant and gives a friendly handshake to Mr. Krabs] Oh, I can't thank you enough for this job, Mr. Krabs. What would you like me to do? [slams his face into the glass doors] Greet people at the door? Serve the food? 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no. I've got a special job that need someone with your special talents. You're on dirty dish detail. 
Clean Bubble: [gets real nervous when he sees a pile of dirty dishes] D-d-d-d-dirty dishes? Wait, couldn't I just work the cash register or something? 
Mr. Krabs: Listen, I hired a dish-washing bubble to save money on soap, and I want these plates sparkling by lunchtime, savvy? 
Clean Bubble: Just call me Sparkles. 
[The Clean Bubble becomes nervous and looks at the dirty dishes. One drop of slime nearly hits the Clean Bubble.] 
Clean Bubble: [sweating] Stay clean, or you'll get mean. Stay clean, or you'll get mean.
[Pans screen to the right, to reveal what appears to be a walking stack of frozen Krabby Patties coming out of the freezer.]
Clean Bubble: Ah?
[SpongeBob removes all the frozen Krabby Patties from himself and places them onto the grill]
SpongeBob: Yeah. [shivers] Brr! Is there a blizzard coming in, 'cause I've got a cold front. [laughs]
Clean Bubble: [laughs with SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi! I didn't see you there, you must be the new dishwasher. Welcome aboard! I'm SpongeBob.
Clean Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob, I'm, uh... DB, uh... DB.
SpongeBob: Oh, we're gonna have so much fun, DB. [gasps] We'll be daily pallies!
[Squidward rings the desk bell multiple times]
SpongeBob: Whoops. [grabs spatula from his hat] Back to work! [flips patties while singing to self]
Clean Bubble: [shudders] Keep it clean, or you'll get mean. [cleaning a dirty dish] Keep it clean, or you'll get mean!
[Dish is sparkling clean. Clean Bubble gasps.]
Clean Bubble: Huh. Hey, I did it! I got dirty and I didn't turn evil! Oh, I must be cured!
[Clean Bubble continuously cleans the dirty dishes with his body, while beginning to turn evil.]
Clean Bubble: Wiping up filth, wiping clean every crack! [transforms to the Dirty Bubble]
Dirty Bubble: I'm the Dirty Bubble, and, baby, I'm back! [evil laugh]
SpongeBob: Oh, what can I get you, Dirty Bubble? [Whistles while flipping a patty. Suddenly turns back surprised. Screams.]
Dirty Bubble: [evilly laughs]
SpongeBob: Dirty Bubble! Where's that nice DB? What did you do to him, you super filthy supervillain?
Dirty Bubble: [evilly laughs at SpongeBob's face]
[Dirty Bubble gets closer to SpongeBob. SpongeBob threatens to spray at him with the sink hose]
SpongeBob: What did you do with DB? [Sobs. Looks at the newly transformed Clean Bubble.]
[Clean Bubble glows and smiles]
SpongeBob: DB is short for Dirty Bubble, isn't it?
Clean Bubble: Yes, SpongeBob, it's me. I'm trying to change my evil ways and stay clean.
SpongeBob: Wow, a supervillain intervention! I'll help you, DB. I'll make sure you stay squeaky clean and dirt-free! [offers a handshake]
[Clean Bubble happily offers a handshake]
Mr. Krabs: [comes from the right with an electric fan, blowing away the Clean Bubble and SpongeBob] Attention, Mr. Bubble, I've got another job for ya!
[Transitions to Mr. Krabs and the Clean Bubble at the bathroom]
Mr. Krabs: Now, this new job is very exclusive and very French.
Clean Bubble: Hmm? Ooh-la-la! [smiles]
Mr. Krabs: [kicks open a filthy toilet] Eau de Toilette!
Clean Bubble: [gasps] Oh, sacre pee-yew! [frowns in worried disgust]
Mr. Krabs: [pointing at him] Make it sparkle! [pulls up pants, and walks off, humming]
[SpongeBob peeks out from the bathroom]
SpongeBob: Okay, he's gone. Don't worry about those toilets, DB. [grabs a toilet scrubber from his hat] I will clean them for you. Taupe sweet, mon ami. [laughs]
[Clean Bubble enthusiastically flushes the closest toilet. His eyes hallucinate.]
Clean Bubble: Dirt, dirt! Beautiful dirt! [goes into the toilet]
SpongeBob: Zut alors! [checks toilet] DB? [Peeks into toilet, and gasps as the Dirty Bubble gradually comes out. Runs off from toilet cubicle] Incoming!
Dirty Bubble: [Evil laughs. Repeatedly sings "Alouette" into each toilet, and shoves customers down the toilet.]
Fred: '[Screams while running away]
Dirty Bubble: Pow! Hold onto your certy, here comes the dirty!
[SpongeBob hoses down the Dirty Bubble with absorbed sink water. The Clean Bubble is transformed back.]
Clean Bubble: Thanks for keeping me clean, SpongeBob! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, DB. We just needed to wash away that stinkin' thinkin'!
[Transitions to a reveal a comic book named "Dirty Bubble Returns!"]
Elaine: For weeks, SpongeBob worked with DB to stay clean and good!
[Moves from a comic frame with Dirty Bubble stealing Patrick's chocolate-coated strawberry ice-cream to SpongeBob hosing down on the Dirty Bubble into the Clean Bubble with a spray bottle.]
[Dirty Bubble then appears in a comic frame where he has appeared in a laundromat, but SpongeBob grabs him and places him into the dishwasher while Old Man Jenkins still has clean washed clothes.]
[The Dirty Bubble appears yet again in another comic frame where he spits out a fountain of mud onto a bus "White Suit Society" while the fish of the bus scream and panic. SpongeBob comes in surfing and washes the Dirty Bubble down. The Clean Bubble comes on the surfboard]
[Transition to the Krusty Krab. Squidward is sleeping at the cash register area, while SpongeBob mops the floor. The Clean Bubble comes in to serve a tray of three Krabby Patties and two drinks, while whistling.]
Clean Bubble: [serves the tray to the family of customers] Enjoy those patties! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, DB, looks like you're cured. You haven't been dirty in weeks!
Clean Bubble: Thanks to you, SpongeBob, I'll never be dirty again! [laughs]
Patrick: Speaking of dirty... [Picks his belly button to reveal bellybutton gunk. Patrick stares at it menacingly, and flicks it off.] Ew.
[Bellybutton gunk lands on the Clean Bubble. The gunk spreads around him. The gunk finally cracks open to reveal the Dirty Bubble]
Dirty Bubble: [laughs evilly] You want me clean, but I ain't willing! I've gotta be me, by being a villain! [Evilly laughs. Looks left and right, then moves out to the left]
Patrick: [sheds a tear] Aww... That's nice. He found his rainbow!
SpongeBob: [surprised face] Uh-oh. [nervous face]
[At a news report of Dirty Bubble]
Elaine: The Dirty Bubble has been seen everywhere, defiling dozens of decent denizens with dirty deeds!
[Two kids play with mud. The Dirty Bubble sucks up everything in the mud pit including the mud and kids. He spits out the kids clean.]
Girl and boy: Clean? [looks at each other and cries]
[At the cabin of an abandoned ship named "The Buccaneer," surrounded by a number of landmines]
Pirate: So I said to the scalawag, "Listen here, you–" [The Dirty Bubble cleans him, transforming him into a chubby sailor.]
Chubby sailor: It's time to have tea and cakes!
Sailor #1: Get him! [everyone punches the chubby sailor]
[The Dirty Bubble comes towards a poorly maintained building. The family of three run out of the building. He cleans the entire building.]
Family of three: Yay!
[Dirty Bubble smashes building from top to bottom and laughs.]
Family of three: [disappointed] Aww.
[At the school "Poseidon Elementary"]
Old teacher: Yes, Billy, 2 plus 2 still equals 4.
[The Dirty Bubble comes and wipes out the old teacher's face]
Old teacher: [muffled] Rumpy rumpkins. [rubs face and mumbles]
Perch Perkins: Breaking news, the Dirty Bubble just wiped all the teacher's dirty looks right off their faces! Who will be next?
Dirty Bubble: [comes up to Perch Perkins and rubs off his face] No more pimples, no more bumps, no more news guy's dirty looks! [evil laugh, kisses Perkin's face to reveal an inverted face]
Perch Perkins: Hello– Urrgh, that got in my mouth!
[Dirty Bubble kicks out Perkins]
Dirty Bubble: [evil laughs, but gets hosed] Oh!
SpongeBob: Sorry, old chum, but from now on, you're gonna have to stay clean for good!
[The Dirty Bubble's grime is shown not to be wiped out]
Dirty Bubble: Be gone, hygiene. I'm too big to stay clean! [follows toward the hose while eating the water, then sucks up the entire hose and fire hydrant]
SpongeBob: [panicking sounds]
[The Dirty Bubble spits out five miniature versions of the Dirty Bubble]
SpongeBob: [more panicking sounds]
Dirty Bubble: [Evil laugh]
[Mini Dirty Bubbles bite SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [grabs spatula] It's on, now! [pops four of five miniature Dirty Bubbles with his spatula. Stomps on the final miniature Dirty Bubble]
[Dirty Bubble looks stumped. SpongeBob launches toward the Dirty Bubble, but bounces off. Dirty Bubble chases after SpongeBob.]
Dirty Bubble: [evil laughs as he chases SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [continually banging against the walls of the Dirty Bubble] Help, help, call the cops, call Mr. Krabs, call my mommy!
[Dirty Bubble looks to his right, and goes to Goo Lagoon. He rips through the sign. Shows a few kids playing in Goo Lagoon, while two unaware fish lay back on separate towels underneath an umbrella.]
Dirty Bubble: I think, for dessert, I'll eat more dirt! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: Not Goo Lagoon!
[Dirty Bubble sucks up Goo Lagoon]
SpongeBob: [grabs out paper and pencil to write quickly his last words] Thank you, my beloved pet Gary, thank you, my big pineapple, and my toolshed, and my mailbox, and Patrick! [Sobs as the dirt level increasingly gets higher and higher. Starts absorbing all the dirt.] Uh, what? Wow. Sometimes I just forget how absorbent I am. [proceeds to spin around inside like clothes in a side-loader washing machine]
Dirty Bubble: Wait, what? Ow, just... stop spinning, you sponge! You're stealing my grunge! [slowly shrinks, stammering] Stop that rhyme! [screams as he is absorbed by SpongeBob]
[SpongeBob falls into Goo Lagoon's seabed. Burps out an shrunken version of the Dirty Bubble.]
Dirty Bubble: [high pitched] I may be a squirt, but I'm still full of dirt! [evil laughs]
SpongeBob: Aww, little mini DB is so cute!
[Dirty Bubble spits dirt onto SpongeBob's eyelid. Officer Johnson catches Dirty Bubble and puts him into a jar held by lady officer]
Lady officer: We got him!
SpongeBob: Every time I wash dishes, I will think of you.
Dirty Bubble: Hmph. Every time I have nightmares, I'll think of you, too! [complaining noises]
Lady officer: Thank you, citizen. We'll take it from here.
SpongeBob: [Pretends to be the Dirty Bubble] It was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it. [evil laugh]
[Police officers gasp]
SpongeBob: Just kidding! [laughs]
[Police officers laugh with him. SpongeBob suddenly feels the urge to sneeze, splattering goo all over the place.]
Police officers: [angrily] Gesundheit!
SpongeBob: Thank you! [looks at lady officer] You got some schmutz under there. [Wipes off goo from her face. Grabs out a tissue and laughs.]
[Screen transitions to a circular black fadeout.]


[Mrs. Puff is panicking while SpongeBob is in his driving test again and destroying stuff, as usual.]
SpongeBob: I'm driving, Mrs. Puff! This is the one! This is the one! Come, on SpongeBob! Think! Think! Uhh... [destroys the lighthouse] Turn that way! Turn that way! D'oh! Turn that way! Right! Left! Oh no! No! [destroys the school building] Come on, don't ever do that! Come on! [a nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears] No! I'm ready! I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do it! I can do it! [flies through the entrance while driving, constantly destroying it, leading the fences falling down]
Mrs. Puff: The driving test is over, SpongeBob. Stop the boat!
SpongeBob: Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff, I can do this!
Mrs. Puff: The road, SpongeBob, get back on the road!
SpongeBob: Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass! [Mrs. Puff is screaming as the boat goes through a cart of watermelons]
Vendor: Hey! What've you got against the melons?!
Mrs. Puff: Look out!
SpongeBob: [has a watermelon on his face] This must be the night driving part of the test. [scene cuts to two police officers using their nightsticks on something offscreen]
Officer Nancy: We're gonna straighten you out!
Officer Malley: This'll fix ya! [They grunt as they hit a parking meter until it's straight] Now let's get that one. [points his nightstick at another crooked parking meter. SpongeBob &amp; Mrs. Puff drive by through a building, knocking it over]
Officer Nancy: Barnacles, did you see that?!
Officer Malley: Yeah! That guy had no front license plate! Let's get him! [SpongeBob looks back at the numerous police cars chasing behind him]
SpongeBob: Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town.
Mrs. Puff: Look out! [The mayor is cutting a ribbon at the end of a bridge that is not finished]
Mayor: It is with great pride that I officially open this unfinished bridge! [SpongeBob drives through the ribbon before he cuts it. The crowd of people that are gathering around the mayor take pictures. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff do not make it on the other side of the bridge so they fall to the bottom.]
Mrs. Puff: Where did I go wrong?! [flashback to Mrs. Puff's first day of boating school] With the opening of my new boating school, I pledge that as long as a student is willing to learn, I shall never give up. [SpongeBob walks up to her]
SpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants. [scene cuts back to Mrs. Puff, who is still screaming. Scene then shows a retirement home where a fish in a white coat is yelling at a truck]
Fish: Hurry up with that truckload of fruit punch! The seniors are getting cranky! [fish looks up and notices SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff crashing into the truck]
Mrs. Puff: Alive! I'm alive! Oh, thank Neptune, I'm still... [a squad car smashes down on the boat mobile. The other squad cars fall on and around the truck. The truck falls over on its side as all the fruit punch comes pouring out]
Feminine Tom: [inside the retirement home] Alright, seniors, let's open these windows so the world can see your nice white clothes. [when the window is opened, the fruit punch pours in. Scene cuts to Fred, who is mopping the hallway and listening to "Surfin' Summer" by the Beach Boys on his headphones. The fruit punch fills the hallway, drains, and Fred is still mopping the same spot. Scene cut to an elderly fish man, who is writing on some paper]
Elderly Fish: Oh, it's finally finished! A memoir of my life, written in red ink. [red punch comes flowing in, making his memoir papers soggy and red] Aww, barnacles! [scene cuts back to outside where all the mess is]
Mrs. Puff: Ow. SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob: That depends, did I pass?
Officer Nancy: Freeze, you're under arrest!
Mrs. Puff: Hold it, you can't arrest him! He's just a student driver!
Officer Nancy: We're not talking about him. [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff wearing a prison uniform, being locked up in jail]
Mrs. Puff: But I don't belong here! It's all a big mistake!
Prisoner 1: Yeah, I don't belong here, either!
Prisoner 2: Me too! I'm innocent!
Prisoner 3: [yelling in a butch Southern drawl] I belong here! [this triggers some other prisoners to complain about their not belonging here too. Puff walks over and sits down on the bed]
Mrs. Puff: Okay, you can do this, Puff. You can get through this without losing your sanity. Oh, that's a road we don't want to go down again. Positives. Think of the positives. Let's see... I've got no more papers to grade. Yeah! [laughs then jumps to the floor] In fact, no more work. No more boating school classes. No more driving, no more SpongeBob... [Mrs. Puff's brain clicks and a sonar ping is heard] No more phone solicitors, no more SpongeBob! No more company potlucks, no more SpongeBob! [gets into bed] No more road rage, no more SpongeBob! No more insurance payments, no more SpongeBob! No more SpongeBob! [laughing] No more SpongeBob! [screaming maniacally] No more SpongeBob! [sighs] I think I'm going to like this place. [scene cuts to her boating school, which is deserted and dusty, with SpongeBob the only one in the room]
SpongeBob: Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff with a happy expression]
Mrs. Puff: [hums while breaking rocks. Scene cuts to her making license plates] ♪Smelling the pretty roses, whoo hoo hoo.♪ [scene cuts to her lifting weights] ♪Haaapiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam!♪ [cuts back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt. [scene cuts to the outside of Patrick's rock]
Patrick: Well, it sounds like it's all your fault.
SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head! [Patrick takes one of his dots and puts it in the place of where his nose would be if he had one] Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail.
Patrick: How are we gonna do that? [scene cuts to the First Nautical Bank]
SpongeBob: Alright, put the money in the bag! [SpongeBob is in the bank, wearing a sock over his head, with a bag in his hands, facing the wrong way. He yells] Put it in!
Bank Teller: Umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir.
SpongeBob: [turns around then laughs. Yells again] Alright, give me the money!
Bank Teller: Will that be from your savings or your checking account, sir?
SpongeBob: Uhh, savings.
Bank Teller: May I please see some identification?
SpongeBob: Sure. [takes out a card and gives it to the bank teller] Here ya go.
Bank Teller: Thank you. [SpongeBob's Jellyfishers Club Membership card is shown. As the bank teller types on the cash register, SpongeBob lifts up the sock on his head and gives Patrick a thumbs up] Sir, we are showing a balance of zero dollars and zero cents for both of your accounts.
SpongeBob: Oh.
Bank Teller: Next! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of the bank]
SpongeBob: Well, that went better than expected.
Patrick: Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast! [SpongeBob's eyes rip through the sock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick disguised as yellow and pink rocks]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. [a truck full of rocks drives up]
Fish: Hey, there's a couple. [gets out and throws the two rocks in the truck]
Guard: Put your back in it, girls! [women prisoners are crushing rocks outside. The truck arrives and unloads more rocks]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, there she is! [both jump over to Mrs. Puff where she is about to hit them] Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick!
Mrs. Puff: That's funny. For a second, I thought that yellow rock talked to me. And its voice sounded a lot like...
SpongeBob: SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff screams as she throws the pickaxe behind her] We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff! [Mrs. Puff starts shaking]
Mrs. Puff: It's you. What are you doing here? Why did you follow me in here? Why?! [one of the guards walks up, with Mrs. Puff's pickaxe in his head]
Guard #1: Alright, Mrs. Puff, it seems like this heat's gone to your head. If you're gonna talk to rocks, I guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty.
Mrs. Puff: Yes, it must be the heat. Yes. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here. [a woman prisoner walks over] No, wait! [she smashes the two rocks into pieces] There goes our deposit on these costumes. [scene cuts to lunchtime where Mrs. Puff is serving chili to the prisoners.]
Mrs. Puff: There you are. [A woman with a deep voice walks up to Mrs. Puff]
Woman: Hey there, Puff Mama. What's today's grub?
Mrs. Puff: Hi, Donna. It's chili, same as always. Let me get you some. [scoops up SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob!
Mrs. Puff: When are these horrific hallucinations going to end? [SpongeBob gets out of the chili]
SpongeBob: No, it's really me! [pulls Patrick up out of the chili] I brought Patrick along too.
Patrick: Hi.
Mrs. Puff: Why?
SpongeBob: 'Cause we're gonna set you free!
Mrs. Puff: No, I mean, why'd you bring him? [Patrick eats some chili]
SpongeBob: He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees. [makes a rectangle-shaped entrance in the chili]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I am not going with you.
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on!
Patrick: SpongeBob, I think she means it.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's crazy, Patrick.
Mrs. Puff: He's right, SpongeBob. I'm staying.
SpongeBob: But why?
Mrs. Puff: I like it here. These are my people! [cut to a shot of some angry, gruff looking woman prisoners] And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou... [we see SpongeBob sad. He is sniffling as a single teardrop falls from his eye] ...uranium! In the water supply. [she whips out a glass of water] See? Crystal clear! [she guzzles the water and tosses away the glass] Aahhhh!
SpongeBob: Excuse us for just one second, Mrs. Puff. [to Patrick] Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison. [scene cuts to Frankie Billy in traffic then at his desk at work and then staring out his bedroom window]
Frankie's wife: Coming to bed, honey?
Frankie Billy: Yes, dear. [scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom.
Mrs. Puff: For the last time, no! [SpongeBob and Patrick disappear inside the chili as a guard walks up] I'm not going with you! That's final! [notices the guard] Oh. [laughs nervously]
Guard #1: Talking to inanimate objects again, huh, Puff? Hmph. Get back to your cell. No more kitchen time for you. [Mrs. Puff walks off sad. SpongeBob and Patrick watch her. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff burning coal into wire hangers until SpongeBob and Patrick come down the conveyor belt]
SpongeBob: Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on!
Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come quick. [The guards run over to her] There's a crazed ex-student of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out!
Guard #1: That's just raw material used to make coat hangers. You need some rest. [Grunts as he pushes the level down, squishing SpongeBob and Patrick, which fills the room with steam. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff brushing her teeth. SpongeBob and Patrick come up from the toilet]
SpongeBob: Psst! [Mrs. Puff screams] Hop in, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come look! [guard runs over and sees SpongeBob and Patrick in the toilet]
Guard #1: Whoa. They don't pay me enough to do this job. [The guard flushes the toilet. Cuts to Mrs. Puff in her bed. SpongeBob and Patrick peek from the top bunk]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, up here.
Mrs. Puff: Guards, guards! They're back! [two guards walk up]
Guard #1: What's all the hubbub, Puff?
Mrs. Puff: They're back! [guards remove their heads showing them as SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Mrs. Puff, it's us! [both wink and give her a thumbs up]
Mrs. Puff: [screams and cries as the real two guards run up]
Guard #1: What the barnacle is going on?
Mrs. Puff: Get away from me! Get away!
Guard #1: What are you talking about, Puff?
Mrs. Puff: You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili. [rips off the guards' faces leaving their skulls shown]
Guard #1: Let's face it, Puff, you've gone off the deep end. [scene cuts to the guards throwing Mrs. Puff, who is in a straitjacket, in a small square room] Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement! [slams the door, which makes a squeaking sound]
Mrs. Puff: Oh well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room.
SpongeBob: Made of sponge! [laughs. The room is made of yellow sponge as SpongeBob's face appears on all sides of the wall. Mrs. Puff screams as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air with the police behind them.] I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test! [The boat crashes into the truck full of punch, knocking it over, and spilling again]
Officer Malley: Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk. [police officers walk over]
Mrs. Puff: No! What? [policemen grab SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: No! What are you doing? Help! Help! [As the officers carry him to the jail vehicle, he kicks his legs.] No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! [They throw him into the back of the police car, then drive off]
Mrs. Puff: I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail!
Officer Malley: Why would you go to jail? You already did your time. [zoom out to reveal Mrs. Puff wearing prison striped clothes with a ball chained to her ankle. She screams as the scene goes back to her screaming while the boat is in mid-air]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, it's just my imagination again. [zooms over to show Donna driving the boat]
Donna: So what's for dinner tonight, Puff Mama? Chili? [Mrs. Puff screams again as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air]
Mrs. Puff: Huh? What? Huh? Ah, forget it.


[The episode begins at a local circus. A giant jellyfish and an elephant snail are performing in the center ring. The elephant snail makes its loud trumpet roar, spitting saliva onto SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: I heart the circus! [laughs]
Ringmaster: Children of all ages! Get ready to wet your baggy pants laughing! Send in the clowns! [grabs his assistant and uses him like a whip] He-yah!
[A small car enters the center ring. It drives around and around until several clowns come out.]
Ringmaster: Our candy-corn-fed clowns once roamed the slapstick plains where wild clowns run free! [grabs his assistant and uses him as a whip again] He-yah! [the clowns line up; he whips them again] He-yah! [the clowns form into a pyramid; he whips them again] He-yah! [the clowns form into a ferris wheel; he whips them again] He-yah! [the clowns form into a balloon donkey; it brays and explodes]
[The clowns wave at the audience.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [cheering wildly]
Patrick: Look, there's those!
SpongeBob: [sees a small clown] Oh. Are you hungry, little clown? [tries to feed the little clown a piece of popcorn, but the ringmaster whips them]
Ringmaster: He-yah! DON'T FEED THE CLOWNS!
SpongeBob: [melts in his body] Why not?
Patrick: Huh? [pulls SpongeBob together] SpongeBob, are you mad? Clowns are dangerous animals. Why, at any moment, one of those things could get loose and bite our feet off! [pulls off his feet]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, that little clown wouldn't do that. He was friendly.
[The little clown waves at the audience until he notices his clown friends climbing back into their car. The little clown pushes the bigger clown in the car and follows them in. The car crashes into a pole and the clowns fall out unconscious. An ambulance drives into the ring. Two paramedics come out with a stretcher. SpongeBob and Patrick biting their nails in worry. The paramedics carry the clowns to the ambulance. The little clown climb on to the top, takes out a flower and pretends to die. Then wakes up and waves to the audience. The audience laughs.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] I wanna go backstage and see the clowns, Patrick.
Patrick: I told you, SpongeBob, our feet are in danger!
SpongeBob: [grabs Patrick just as he was about to leave] I'll protect you.
[SpongeBob drags Patrick backstage and hides behind some crates.]
SpongeBob: Ooh.
[The clowns walk into a pen as if they were farm animals. The clowns lick themselves, pick on each other's hair and sniff around. The little clown walks up and takes off his hat.]
Little Clown: Huh?
[The tall clown takes his foot and pushes the little clown, sending him flying to the ding bell.]
SpongeBob: Poor little guy.
[The ringmaster dumps candy in a bin and whistles for the clowns. The clowns run up and eat the candy like animals. The little clown wants to eat some, but couldn't get in between the bigger clowns. The big clowns walk away, leaving the little clown with no food.]
SpongeBob: Hey, he didn't get any food. Hmm. [sneaks away and walks up to the sad, little clown] Hey, psst!
Little Clown: Huh? [hooing happily as SpongeBob is about to feed him popcorn]
[SpongeBob dumps popcorn in the little clown's hands, but the ringmaster catches them and whips them.]
Ringmaster: DON'T FEED THE CLOWNS!
[SpongeBob screams and runs away from the circus with Patrick.]
Patrick: My feet!
Ringmaster: Pack it up, everyone. [whips again] He-yah!
[The clowns fold up the tent like an umbrella and pack up all of their props. The little clown attempted to help, but he gets stepped on and pushed around by the other clowns. The clowns load up the car, including the elephant snail, and begin to drive away. The little clown gets up and tries to catch up to the circus, but they kept on driving. The little clown is now lost and alone. The scene changes to SpongeBob dragging a bag of popcorn the next morning.]
SpongeBob: I don't care what that mean old ringmaster says. That clown is hungry, and I'm gonna feed him. [sees cotton candy flying everywhere, but the circus is not there] Hey, where'd the circus go? Now I'll never find that little clown.
[SpongeBob trips over something and drops his bag of popcorn. He gets up and sees the little clown. The little clown gets scared and squirts SpongeBob with his flower.]
SpongeBob: [gets choked on with water and gulps it down] There you are.
[The little clown squeaks.]
SpongeBob: Hey, little clown. The circus left without you! Quick, we gotta get you back to your clown friends. [tries to get the little clown moving, but the clown refused to budge] Oh, you don't want to go back to the circus?
[The little clown shakes his head, saying "no."]
SpongeBob: You don't want to be a circus clown?
[The little clown holds out a circus pennant and eats it. He then waves his hand in front of his face and makes his frown into a smile.]
SpongeBob: You know, little clown, I don't blame you. You shouldn't stay in a place where they push you around all the time. Looks like I'll have to help you find a new job. But what else can you do?
[The little clown points to a hot dog stand.]
SpongeBob: Oh, you want to work there? [the little clown nods his head, saying "yes."] This job should be a snap, little clown. Watch me. [shows the little clown how to make a hot dog] ♪Pick up the hot dog, put it in a bun, add the mustard, relish, now you're having fun♪ [the little clown eats the hot dog]
Customers: Oh-ho-ho, hot dog! Look at that. [holds up money] Looks like fun!
SpongeBob: [quietly] Okay, you're on.
[The little clown takes out several hot dogs without the tongs. The hog dogs burn the little clown's hand and juggles them. He throws the hot dogs in the customers eyes, which causes them to scream. The little clown squirts mustard in the customers mouths with his flower. The customers run off until the hot dog vendor arrives.]
Vendor: My wieners! [growls]
SpongeBob: Oh, is this your cart? Sorry.
[The vendor grabs SpongeBob and the little clown. He stuffs SpongeBob in a bun like a hot dog and sprits the little clown on him like mustard. The vendor throws SpongeBob and the little clown away. The scene changes to SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: I think you'll get a job a lot quicker if we tone down the whole clown thing a smidge. Don't worry. When I get through with you, your own ringmaster won't recognize you.
[Several balloon animals pop on the screen. SpongeBob shaves the little clown's hair. He turns the little clown's pants strap into a tie. He puts a tuxedo on the little clown and replaces the clown's shoes with regular shoes. SpongeBob smooches himself and shows the little clown his new look. SpongeBob puts one more detail on the clown: a mustache. The little clown is happy and claps. The scene changes to a department building.]
SpongeBob: "Businessmen wanted." [opens the door] Go get 'em, little clown. Oh, I mean, Mr. Little Clown. [laughs as the little clown enters the building]
[The little clown presents himself to the CEO.]
CEO: Hmm? [grabs the little clown and puts him in his work station] Here's your stool. And here's your stamper. Now get to work.
[The little clown begins his job and stamps several paperwork.]
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Aww. [sheds a tear and leaves]
[The little clown continues stamping the papers. He then stamps the papers with his feet. Then he stamps ink all over his face. He stamps his face onto the papers. He jumps on the conveyor belt and hops up and down. He stamps a checkmark on two employers and a no sign on another. A security guard drags the employer with the no sign out. The CEO hears the commotion.]
CEO: Hmm?
[He sees the little clown stamping his buttocks on the papers and making a total mess. He growls and pulls the conveyor belt down towards him.]
CEO: Who hired this clown?!
CEO's assistant: Um, you did, sir.
[The little clown squeaks. The CEO gets really mad and explodes a mushroom cloud over his head.]
CEO: Fired!
[The little clown screams and runs out of the building. SpongeBob is flipping a coin until the little clown runs into him.]
SpongeBob: What happened, little clown? Didn't you like that job?
[The little clown nods his head, saying "no", blows up a whoopee cushion and presses on it.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. [sees a fire hydrant] Ooh!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob taking the little clown, who is now dressed in his firefighting outfit, to the Bikini Bottom Fire Department.]
SpongeBob: Maybe a career in firefighting.
[SpongeBob opens the door and the little clown goes in the fire department. The fire engine drives out with the little clown.]
SpongeBob: Have a nice fire! [the little clown waves a SpongeBob; SpongeBob goes to leave until he stops] I'll just make sure he gets there safely. [smacks his head and his bump glows red; then he makes siren sounds]
[The fire engine drives up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School as it is completely on fire. The ladder crashes into the school's burning sign and firefighters struggle to put out the fire. The little clown clings onto the hose as SpongeBob arrives at the scene.]
SpongeBob: [mimics siren sounds] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Not Mrs. Puff's Boating School!
Mrs. Puff: [sticks herself out the window] Save me! Save me! I'm too young to broil!
[The little clown screams and grabs a bucket. He climbs up a ladder and instead of saving her and putting out the fire, he throws confetti in her face. The entire boating school becomes engulfed in flames until everything is burnt to a crisp.]
Mrs. Puff: [panting and puffs herself up] You're fired!
[Mrs. Puff's outburst causes the little clown to fall to the ground. The scene changes to SpongeBob and the little clown at the bakery.]
SpongeBob: This is it, little clown. The last job available in Bikini Bottom. [puts a chef's hat on the little clown's head]
[The little clown whimpers and gets really nervous.]
SpongeBob: If you can just stop the clowning for two minutes, you'll have a job. Please! Sorry, little clown. It's been a long day. [laughs feebly] Good luck. [laughs]
[The little clown waves his hand at his face and makes his frown become a smile. The little clown enters the bakery and SpongeBob peeks through the window.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [sees through donuts] Hmm. [gets blocked by a cake] Hmm. Aha! [pushes out his eyeballs] Now get in there, eyes, and stay close to that clown.
[SpongeBob's eyeballs run into the bakery and go to watch over the little clown.]
Head baker: Your job is to pack up the pies! now get to work
[The little clown salutes in agreement.]
Head baker: Hmm! [leaves]
[SpongeBob's eyeballs hide behind some boxes. The little clowns sniffs some pies. He remembers how he used to throw pies at the clowns as part of his act at the circus. He also remember how he loved getting himself pied in the face. He looks over at the head baker, who is busy baking, and goes over to throw a pie at him. SpongeBob's eyeballs yelp in fear.]
SpongeBob: No! No, little clown! No! [runs into the bakery]
[As the little clown prepares to throw the pie, SpongeBob comes in the kitchen. The little clown throws the pie.]
SpongeBob: [slow motion] No! [gets pied in the face] Phew! [laughs]
[The little clown pies the head baker in the face. He starts to act crazy and throws pies all over the place. He throws pies at three bakers and several customers waiting in line outside.]
SpongeBob: Hot pepper pie?!
[Nat Peterson gets pied with the hot pepper pie and his face burns and melts off.]
SpongeBob: Lemon pie?!
[A little kid gets pied with the lemon pie and her face sours up.]
SpongeBob: Honey pie?!
[Fred gets pied with the honey pie.]
Fred: [licks some honey] Mmm! [gets stung by jellyfish until his face is swollen]
[The little clown grabs SpongeBob's eyes and stuffs them in a pie. Then he throws the pie with the eyeballs in them at SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Eye pie!
[The head baker gets really angry. The pie batter hardens up around him and cracks into pieces. He growls and grinds his teeth.]
Head baker: You... Are...
SpongeBob: Fired?
[The head baker grabs SpongeBob and the little clown. He rolls them up into a batter and forms them into pie. He then puts them both into a box and ties them up.]
Head baker: Au revoir!
[The head baker rings the bell and a deliver man takes it. He drives his pie truck away from the bakery and gives the pie to a lady sitting on the bench.]
Tina Fran: Huh? I didn't order a pie. [opens the box and SpongeBob and the little clown pop out; scaring her away]
SpongeBob: Oh, little clown, I'm so sorry. I thought you needed a day job, but you're a clown. And a clown needs to run free.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and the little clown traveling through the kelp forest. SpongeBob chops through the kelp with his knife. He peeks through the kelp and reveals a colorful world full of clowns. Clowns are riding on balloon animals, eating candy for food, throwing pies at eating other, and doing other crazy things clowns do at the circus. The little clown was so happy and hugs SpongeBob. He joins the other clowns, who examine him by sniffing him. The spray water at him and the other clown throws at pie at his friend. The little clown takes out a hammer and smacks the other clown with it.]
SpongeBob: Aww. [gets pie splattered on his pants]
[The little clown waves good-bye to SpongeBob and runs off to join the other clowns.]
SpongeBob: Aww. [sheds a tear and gets pied in the face]
[The little clown squeaks one last time and SpongeBob laughs.]


[Episode starts with SpongeBob, and Patrick getting food at the Reef Cinema. They walk up to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Bet you can't guess what movie we're gonna see!
[Squidward didn't answer when he is drinking his drink]
SpongeBob: That's okay. I'll tell you.
[Squidward still didn’t answer when he’s still drinking his drink]
SpongeBob: It's Fisher...
Squidward: [puts one finger up then stops drinking and smacks his lips] Ah. You may speak.
SpongeBob: [takes a deep breath] Patrick and I are gonna see Fisherman 4! [he and Patrick smile]
Squidward: Ha! You two won't sleep a wink tonight if you see that movie.
SpongeBob: Squidward, you are looking at two very grown up big boys.
Patrick: Yeah. Nothing can scare us.
Squidward: [effortlessly] Boo.
SpongeBob and Patrick:: [still screaming, but stop and pant]
SpongeBob: Ahem. We'll show Squidward. We're not afraid of any old movie. [he and Patrick go in the aisle in the movie room. The door closes and it becomes pitch dark in there]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa!
Patrick: We're lost.
SpongeBob: I wish we had a flashlight. [a flashlight coming from a Cinema Anglerfish shines on them]
Cinema Anglerfish: Take your seats!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream and sit down]
SpongeBob: Seats taken, sir. Ooh, the movie's starting! [he and Patrick start eating their popcorn. The screen says, "The following preview has been approved for all audiences - S: Rated S for Scary." Then it says, "Fisherman 4: Attack of the Hook." Lightning flashes in the movie]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream]
Shubie: Shhh!
SpongeBob: Sorry. [In the movie, children are in a playground where Monroe Timmy and Billy are playing in a teeter totter] So isn't too scary. [The scene pans up to the fisherman's hook] The Fisherman's hook! Get off the teeter totter!
Patrick: You fools! [the hook goes into Monroe Timmy's mouth and pulls him up. He screams]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both scream]
SpongeBob: The Fisherman's got him!
Patrick: And he'll fry them into fish sticks! I can't watch! Is the scary part over?
SpongeBob: Hold on, I'll take a peek.
Edwina: Thank you for meeting me, Edwina, at midnight.
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's okay.
Patrick: You sure? [screams] It's worse! [fishes kiss] They're kissing!
Edwina: I love you, Susie.
Jennifer: It's Jennifer.
Edwina: I'll never leave you, Jennifer. [the Fisherman's hook drops down on-screen and grabs the male fish by his pants and pulls him up] Goodbye, Margaret!
SpongeBob and Patrick: The Fisherman! [throw their buckets of popcorn in the air. They fall on the three people behind them]
People: [scream, then grumble]
SpongeBob: Uh, sorry, sorry, sorry! [he and Patrick get their buckets back]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream and hide in the hole in their seats]

{{L|Narrator|Two hours later...

Patrick: See if it's safe. [SpongeBob puts his head out of his seat. The screen says, "The End"]
SpongeBob: Aww, the movie's over. [Patrick does the same. Everyone gets out of their seats]
Patrick: Oh, dang. We hardly even saw it.
SpongeBob: Well, we'll watch it again. And this time, all the way through. [scene cuts to him and Patrick watching the movie again. There are two kid fish eating ice cream in the movie] Okay. Keep your eyes open.
Patrick: No problem.
Kid Fish in Movie: I love eating ice cream.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm getting scared. Hold my eyelids open.
Patrick: I'm on it. [goes to the row behind them and pulls SpongeBob's eyelids]
SpongeBob: D'ohhhh! [the Fisherman's hook is lowered and takes the fish's ice cream]
Kid Fish in Movie: Hey! My ice cream! [falls to the ground and cries] No! It was rocky road!
SpongeBob: Must close eyes! Too scary!
Patrick: I can't hold your eyelids—they're too slippery! [SpongeBob's eyelids close and his hands get stuck in them] Ow! [screams]
SpongeBob: [screams as a fish walks by sweeping but stops when he hears SpongeBob and Patrick screaming. He continues sweeping and starts whistling. SpongeBob and Patrick are hugging each other. Patrick has his bucket on his head. SpongeBob looks at the screen. It says, "The end" again] Oh, no, we missed the movie.
Patrick: What?! Not again!
SpongeBob: It's okay, we'll just see the next one.
Cinema Anglerfish: I'm afraid not. That was the last showing.
SpongeBob: Wow. Uh, what time is it?
Cinema Anglerfish: It is one minute to midnight.
SpongeBob: One... minute... to midnight?! [he and Patrick get out of their seats]
Patrick: But that's when the Fisherman comes out! [he and SpongeBob run out of the room]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, we've got to get home!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick:  [scream] The Fisherman! [they have ran into a cardboard cutout of the Fisherman with the title of the movie beside it. They run out of the Reef Cinemas screaming] ''[the clock tolls, meaning that it's midnight. A little cardboard cutout of the Fisherman comes out of the clock and lowers his cardboard hook and catches a cardboard fish. It goes back in the clock] It's midnight! The Fisherman! [run to SpongeBob's door]
SpongeBob: Phew. We made it.
Patrick: I guess we showed that old horror movie who's boss.
SpongeBob: Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact.
Patrick: It's like we're heroes.
SpongeBob: Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow.
Patrick: Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?
SpongeBob: No. No, you don't. I'm gonna walk you to your door. [starts walking Patrick to his door]
Patrick: Darn old horror movie. Why couldn't we watch a cartoon instead? [foghorn blows] Do you hear that?
SpongeBob: [whispering] I think it's coming from over there. [points to fog. A shadow comes behind it]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: It's the Fisherman! [scream and hide behind Patrick's rock; Slasher McGee passes by on a small bike with training wheels]
SpongeBob: Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there. [tries to move but doesn't] Just a few steps that away. [tries again but fails] In the dark? All alone?
Patrick: Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home. [starts walking SpongeBob home]
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?
Patrick: Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it. [a shadow comes over them. Behind the fog there is a shadow of the Fisherman] 
SpongeBob and Patrick: The Fisherman! [scream but then notice that the shadow is actually of jellyfish who had formed a shadow of the Fisherman. SpongeBob and Patrick continue screaming. Squidward wakes up and growls. He gets out of bed. SpongeBob and Patrick run around screaming but stop and pant]
Squidward: What is wrong with you?! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and jump to Squidward's windows. They shiver]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Squidward.
Squidward: What are you blockheads up to? Don't you know it's after midnight? Get down here!
Patrick: We can't get home.
SpongeBob: We're too scared. [Squidward growls. Scene changes to Squidward walking to Patrick's rock with SpongeBob on his head wearing his nightcap and Patrick holding onto him]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Thank you, Squidward. You are a true friend. [Squidward opens Patrick's rock with his left foot and throws Patrick in]
Patrick: Thanks, Squidwar... [Squidward closes his rock and grumbles. He walks over to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Yeah, thanks, Squidward. I don't think we would've ever gotten home with you.
Squidward: Hat.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Here. [gives Squidward's nightcap back. Squidward pulls SpongeBob's legs, which shoots him through his mail slot and into his bed]
Squidward: I told those muttonheads not to see that movie. [walks into his house]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Are you okay?
Patrick: Yeah! Are you okay?
SpongeBob: I think so! Good night!
Patrick: Yeah., good night! Just don't think about the Fisherman!
SpongeBob: Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!
Squidward: Oh, "The Fisherman." "The Fisherman." Blah, blah, blah. They want a Fisherman, eh? I'll give them a Fisherman! And how! [goes to his closet and turns on the light. He pulls out a vampire costume] No. [pulls out a Frankenstein costume] No. [pulls out an Easter Bunny costume] Um... no. [pulls out a fisherman's hat and coat] Aha! [lightning strikes. Squidward is outside and has the coat on] It's time for those lame-brains to meet the real Fisherman. [puts on the hat with a beard attached to it. Lightning strikes again as Squidward lowers the hook from the fishing rod] This is gonna be good. [laughs. Lightning strikes again. Squidward is in a boat on the roof of his house his hook at Patrick's rock, scrapes it, and opens it a little four times. Patrick wakes up and opens his rock with his head]
Patrick: Uh, hello? Someone there? [the hook hooks under his left nostril] Uh, uh? What's that? [stammers] There's something stuck... [grunts] Huh. [the hook starts pulling it] Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. A little to the left. [drools] Oh, yeah. All right. Right there. [laughs. Squidward laughs and pulls the hook]
Squidward: Gotcha! [the hook pulls Patrick out of his rock]
Patrick: [screams as he sees Squidward] The Fisherman! [screams and runs]
Squidward: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. [the rod goes after Patrick and starts to pull Squidward and the boat with it; Squidward screams; the boat rides up Patrick's open rock and soars in the air. Patrick screams twice while Squidward starts laughing. He runs to SpongeBob's house, pulls his door open, goes inside, and closes the door causing Squidward to smash into the door. Patrick sees Squidward outside, laughing. Patrick runs, with his face ripped off from the hook, he runs up to SpongeBob's bedroom] SpongeBob! Get up! He's here!
SpongeBob: Who's here? Hold on, let me get up. [scream] Your face!
Patrick: Oh. [takes his head and stretches it, making his face whole again] There.
SpongeBob: Now who's here?
Patrick: Uh, someone's here?
SpongeBob: You just said.
Patrick: Oh. The Fisherman's here.
SpongeBob: The Fisherman!
Patrick: The Fisherman!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [scream and run in circles on SpongeBob's bed]
Squidward: Ha Ha Ha Ha. This is the most perfect. What a couple of hopeless babies. I really should stop. But I'm having too much fun. (goes in SpongeBob's house) Ha. It's almost too easy.
SpongeBob: Quick. Block the door.
Squidward: There's just no sport in it.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick push stuff over to SpongeBob bedroom door] Get everything?
Patrick: What about this? (Patrick holds Gary)
SpongeBob: Not Gary. Think it'll hold?
Patrick: I sure hope so. (SpongeBob and Patrick look into window and sees Squidward, laughing)
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: (scream as Squidward opens the window and then scream again)
Patrick: Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah. Just like the movie. (they close their eyes, later open them to see Squidward behind them)
Squidward: I'm the Deadly Fisherman!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick:  (scream)
SpongeBob: I guess this is the end, old buddy.
Patrick: I don't want to die in my underwear!
SpongeBob: Here. (SpongeBob takes off his underwear) Die in mine.
Patrick: Hey. Good idea. Let's trade. (Patrick takes off his underwear) Here you go.
SpongeBob: And here you go. (SpongeBob and Patrick trade underwears and puts on their underwears) Now where were we? Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [screams] He's gonna turn us into fish sticks!
Squidward: [laughing]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick:  (scream)
SpongeBob: That thing's eating Squidward!
Patrick: Not our bestest buddy! We gotta save him! Okay, play 33. I need you to go long. And... break. You're going down, Fisherman! [starts beating up Squidward's Fisherman costume while SpongeBob grabs Squidward's neck]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window. [He and Sauidward jump out of the window and Patrick throws heavy objects onto Squidward] Okay! I think you got it! [Sirens sound] [Squidward grumbles as he is taken into an ambulance] Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, there, there, no need to thank us. We were only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that old monster anymore. [The Fisherman costume growls at them]
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [scream and run into ambulance. The Fisherman costume falls down, revealing Gary]
Gary: Meow. [starts sleeping on the costume]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob getting himself ready to go to sleep. He stretches, yawns, and hops into bed. He puts on his nightcap, fluffs up his pillow, and lays down to sleep. But when he breathes, he notices something was wrong with his mouth. He smacks his lips and opens his mouth. Inside, his tongue is all dried up and a family of hillbilly germs move away because they're home has no water. SpongeBob realizes that he is thirsty, so he gets out of bed to get a drink of water. He walks downstairs and into the living room.]
SpongeBob: [notices the plant on the edge of the table] Oops. [pushes plant back] Doink. [pours water in a glass and drinks it; but he spits it out after seeing the refrigerator open] I don't remember leaving the fridge open. Huh? [closes the fridge and sees the living room a complete mess] Huh, I don't remember making such a mess. [spaghetti falls on his face] And I'm pretty sure I didn't eat spaghetti. [opens his stomach, revealing a lite candle, a Krabby Patty, some fries, and a soda] Nope. [puts spaghetti in his stomach and closes it; then a big noise from upstairs] Huh?
[The noise gets louder and scarier. SpongeBob walks over to the stairs to investigate. As he got closer, a shadowy figure comes down the stairs. SpongeBob quivers with fear. But, to his surprise, the shadowy figure turned out to be Patrick, who is sleep-walking.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick. [Patrick sleep-walks in the living room] Wake up, Patrick! [grabs Patrick's trunks, but it slips off his hands] Whoa!
[Patrick flies through the air, but continues to sleep-walk. SpongeBob attempts to wake Patrick up by banging a pot with a stick, but nothing's working. Then he tries to wake him up with an air horn, but nothing's working.]
SpongeBob: [hops on Patrick's head to open his eye lids, but falls off] Whoa!
[SpongeBob grabs his alarm clock, turns up the volume, and sets it to the waking hour. SpongeBob's alarm clock bellows a loud noise in Patrick's face. The noise was so loud that it even woke Squidward and several people up. The car alarm goes off and several worms start barking. The alarm clock did not effect Patrick and he continues to sleep-walk. Patrick sleep-walks into the kitchen, activates a toaster, and splatters butter on it. Then he eats the toaster and toast pops out from his mouth. Patrick sleep-walks to the fridge, opens it, and peeks inside.]
Patrick: [screams and eats an ice cream carton]
[Patrick splatters eggs on his buttocks. He walks through the kitchen wall with the fridge on his head. He throws the fridge through the wall and sleep-walks outside. Patrick sleep-walks towards the street where an ongoing traffic.]
SpongeBob: [screams and runs after Patrick]
[Patrick sleep-walks across the street. Luckily, none of the boats hit him. SpongeBob goes after Patrick, but is almost hit by a boat.]
SpongeBob: [screams and grunts as he gets hit by the boats]
[The boats sending SpongeBob flying to the other side of the street. Patrick steps on SpongeBob while sleep-walking to another house. SpongeBob spits sand out of his eyes.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! [runs over to Patrick]
[Patrick sleep-walks to the front door, opens it, and enters inside.]
SpongeBob: No! [runs after Patrick]
[Patrick sleep-walks across the hallway while a married couple are sleeping in their bed. SpongeBob becomes worried that Patrick might make a loud noise that will wake them up. Patrick sleep-walks towards a collection of model ships.]
SpongeBob: [screams and turns Patrick away from the model ships] Whew. [exclaims as Patrick goes to knock over a vase]
[SpongeBob grabs the vase before it fell. Then Patrick starts making loud noises in his sleep. Patrick continues to make loud noises as the male fish starts waking up. SpongeBob jumps onto Patrick and covers his mouth.]
SpongeBob: Shh! Shhh!
[Patrick calms down and the male fish goes back to sleep. SpongeBob slaps Patrick's butt and Patrick sleep-walks out.]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. Phew.
Male Fish: [turns on the light] What the?!
SpongeBob: [gets kicked out, screams, and lands on the ground] Ooh! [gets stepped on by Patrick] Ow! [grabs Patrick's feet and gets dragged]
[Green fumes seeps through the air. Patrick sniffs it and yawns.]
SpongeBob: [sniffs the fumes] Bleach! [the fumes form into a fist and punch SpongeBob's face] Ow!
[The fumes are coming from the Chum Bucket. Patrick goes around the back, enters inside and follows the scent of the fumes. The scent leads to a pot full of chum leftover from Plankton. Patrick grabs the bucket and goes to eat it.]
Patrick: Mm. Ahh...
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, no! [grabs the pot] Don't!
[SpongeBob struggles to keep the pot full of chum away from Patrick. Patrick licks SpongeBob's head with his tongue, which tickles SpongeBob. SpongeBob accidentally drops the pot into his mouth and swallows the chum. The chum made him incredibly sick to the stomach and lets out a small, green fume. The fume then makes a skulls and breathes into SpongeBob's face.]
SpongeBob: [notices Patrick gone] Huh? [screams]
[Patrick sleep-walks into a dance studio. SpongeBob follows, grabs a carton of popcorn, and takes a seat. Patrick performs a little dance in his sleep, then sleep-walks off the stage.]
SpongeBob: Ohh! [claps and sheds a tear]
[Patrick sleep-walks out of the dance studio and slips on a banana peel. The peel sends him slipping into Glove World!. Patrick sleep-walks on the tracks of the Neck Breaker roller coaster ride. SpongeBob flags down a roller coaster car, hops inside and follows Patrick through the tracks.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[SpongeBob reaches out to grab Patrick. The car goes through the loop-de-loop and Patrick falls off his pants.]
Patrick: Breezy.
[Patrick falls back into his pants. SpongeBob falls off the car and holds onto Patrick. Patrick slides up to the top of the track. And after a few seconds, Patrick descends downward while SpongeBob screams at the top of his lungs. Patrick flies off the track and lands directly near his house. SpongeBob pulls himself together and sends Patrick back to his house. Patrick steps on a pebble.]
Patrick: Ow! [strains]
SpongeBob: Oh, brother. [falls asleep as he is completely tired from having such an eventful night]
Patrick: [Notices SpongeBob is now sleepwalking] Oh!
[SpongeBob sleep-walks into the street.]
Patrick: Oh, he'll be fine.
[Patrick jumps on his rock and goes back to sleep. As Patrick closes his rock, crashing noises are heard as SpongeBob is getting run over by the boats, ending the episode.]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down the path with an orange balloon. They take a deep breath and hold it until they reach Sandy's treedome. They enter the dome, put on their water helmets, and spit out water for them to breathe. Sandy is welding some contraptions together for her latest invention. SpongeBob taps her shoulder.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy!
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Check out our new balloon.
Patrick: Her name is Squeaky. [rubs the balloon and squeaks]
Sandy: Sorry, guys, I'm working on my new invention. Y'all better come back tomorrow.
Both: [exclaim] New invention?!
Sandy: See?
[Sandy shows them her new invention as her wheel turns making a colorful vortex.]
Both: Ooh.
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: It's a portal to other worlds. I built it to explore the universe. Also for quick trips to Texas to pick up some of my favorite barbecued nuts. [puts her hand through the portal and takes a bag of nuts from a sleeping old man] Yoink!
Old coot: Huh? Dagnabbit! That ding-dang, nut-stealing arm is back again!
[Sandy pulls her arm back from the portal with a bag of nuts and eats some.]
Sandy: Pretty nifty, huh?
SpongeBob: [looking at the control panel with Patrick] Yeah. Nifty. Ooh, what's this do? [pulls on levers] Vroom, vroom, vroom! [screeches and presses some buttons and a rope]
[Patrick makes beeping sounds as he pushes several buttons. Both SpongeBob and Patrick laugh and continue playing on the control panel.]
Sandy: Hold it, don't touch anything. I gotta go grab some 1/16 inch diodes to finish the weld. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you heard Sandy. [presses buttons as he talks] We shouldn't touch this, or this, or this, or this, or this, or this! [pushes buttons with his feet and toes]
Patrick: Definitely don't do this, SpongeBob. [pushes a lever and pulls another; pushes several buttons with his buttocks] Or..or this! [presses more buttons with his buttocks]
SpongeBob: And under no circumstances should you ever touch this. [pushes red button] Boink.
[Suddenly, the alarm goes off and the button activates the vortex.]
Both: Whoa. [stammering]
Sandy: [comes out of her tree and gasps] Oh, no! You've activated the vortex!
SpongeBob: Ooh, so swirly.
Patrick: Look at all the colors.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are completely hypnotized by the vortex's swirling colors and begin to walk closer to it like zombies.]
Sandy: Whatever you do, don't walk into it!
Patrick: Can we skip into it?
[SpongeBob and Patrick skip up to the vortex.]
Sandy: SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Star, you stop right now! [SpongeBob and Patrick stop] Now turn around. [SpongeBob and Patrick turn around] Now walk.
[SpongeBob and Patrick lift their right legs and instead of walking over to Sandy, they walk backwards into the vortex. The vortex closes.]
Sandy: [gasps] Oh. [groans] Those two ain't no smarter than a circus peanut.
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream as they fly through the swirling vortex. They travel to several different universes until finally, they fall through the vortex ending up in a blank, white dimension.]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Patrick: Whoa!
SpongeBob: Oh, oh! [crashes to the ground and Patrick falls on top of him]
Patrick: Goodness. [comes out of SpongeBob's body] Mm, mmm.
SpongeBob: [looks around] Wow. We've entered a whole new dimension. Uh, a blank, white, empty one.
Patrick: Must be the boring dimension. Let's go home.
SpongeBob: Maybe there's an exit this way. [walks to the left, but ends up going back to Patrick] Huh, hmm, must've made a wrong turn. [walks to the right, but ends up going back to Patrick again] Huh? [sprints around and around, but no matter how he walks in the strange dimension, he always ends up in the same area] Patrick, there's no escape! There's no escape, Patrick!
Patrick: [sobs] I can't take it! Let me out of here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick frantically run up, down, left, right, and loop-de-loop in many attempts to escape. But their efforts were no avail. SpongeBob screeches lines across the floor as he bumps into Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick take notice of the lines moving.]
Both: Hmm. Huh? [the lines crawl away] Ooh!
[SpongeBob draws another line and it crawls away.]
SpongeBob: Mm...[laughs] Oh, Patrick, watch this! [sticks his hand in his head] Boink. [pulls out a giant pencil that looked almost like the magic pencil from Frankendoodle. He draws a boatmobile above them. The boat revs up its engine and runs over Patrick, leaving him tire marks on his face.]
SpongeBob: Whoops, sorry!
Patrick: [gets up] Heh, draw some more!
[SpongeBob draws a door similar to his front door of his house. He opens the door and reveals a living similar to the one at his house.]
SpongeBob: Nice décor. [closes the door] Hmm. [draws a doodle version of his house]
[SpongeBob then draws a doodle version of Squidward's house and Patrick's house.]
Patrick: Oh, my house! [jumps and hugs his doodle house until suddenly, all three houses are being lifted in the air] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah! Hey!
SpongeBob: Oops, forgot to draw the ground.
[SpongeBob draws a horizontal line for the ground. The three doodle houses drop back down, crushing Patrick under one. Patrick pulls himself out and his stomach rumbles.]
Patrick: Ahh.
Patrick's tum-tum: I'm starving.
SpongeBob: No problem. [draws the Krusty Krab work hat] Two patties coming right up! [draws a doodle Krabby Patty] Your doodle patty, sir. [draws himself a doodle Krabby Patty]
[They both eat the doodle patties, however, they tasted horrible.]
Patrick: [spits it out] Tastes weird.
SpongeBob: Yeah, they are a little dry. [his doodle patty and doodle hat crumble to dust]
Patrick: I miss real Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob: I miss Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: I miss Sandy.
SpongeBob: I miss Gary.
Both: I miss Squidward!
Patrick: You know who I miss most of all? [takes the pencil and draws a mini version of DoodleBob] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: But Patrick, I'm right here.
[DoodleBob babbles.]
SpongeBob: Aww, isn't he cute?
Patrick: How do you do?
[DoodleBob babbles and jumps onto Patrick. Patrick hugs DoodleBob.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I'm next on the hug list.
[DoodleBob disappears.]
Patrick: Oh, oh! He disappeared! [reappears in Patrick's belly] Oh, why was a cursed with the hug of death? Why?!
SpongeBob: He's not gone, Patrick. He's right there on your tum-tum.
[DoodleBob multiplies into numerous mini DoodleBobs.]
Doodle Clones: You doodle!
[The Doodle clones all scramble on Patrick's belly while babbling, which at first results in tickling him. Then, without warning, they all start biting him like mosquitoes.]
Patrick: Get 'em off! Get 'em off me, SpongeBob! [the mini DoodleBobs continue biting him]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick! [draws a hose and sprays water on Patrick to wash the DoodleBobs off; leaving him a hole in his stomach]
Patrick: Oh, thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob: You're welcome. [gets up] I guess we need to be more careful.
[DoodleBob comes back to life in the puddle and comes out in a much taller form. He takes the pencil and draws two angry eyebrows on his face. He quickly turns over to SpongeBob and Patrick with the pencil, scaring them out of their wits. DoodleBob babbles.]
SpongeBob: Nice DoodleBob. Put the pencil down.
[DoodleBob draws an anvil and it falls on top of SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Patrick: Oh, run!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run away from DoodleBob. DoodleBob draws a tank over them. SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. DoodleBob draws a piano and SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. DoodleBob draws a safe and SpongeBob and Patrick dodge. SpongeBob and Patrick continue to run with DoodleBob in hot pursuit.]
Patrick: What are we gonna do, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [takes off his left shoe and sharpens it into a pencil point] We'll have to fight doodle with doodle. [draws three doodle versions of Mr. Krabs, Gary, and Squidward] Hold it right there. You're no match for my doodle squad! [Doodle Squidward, Doodle Gary, and Doodle Mr. Krabs come to life] Attack!
[The three doodles run over to fight DoodleBob. But DoodleBob grabs Doodle Squidward and whacks Doodle Mr. Krabs and Doodle Gary. Then he draws angry eyebrows and mustaches on all three of them, making them evil. All three doodles turn against SpongeBob and Patrick and go to attack them.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, run! [Doodle Gary jumps on SpongeBob]
Patrick: Ooh! [Doodle Mr. Krabs pinches Patrick with his claws]
[Doodle Squidward kicks SpongeBob and Patrick in the faces. All three doodles run away and DoodleBob babbles.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm going in. [gives Patrick his shoe] Cover me. [pulls up his pants and runs over to DoodleBob]
Patrick: [draws a blanket] I gotcha, buddy! [puts to blanket over SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Huh? Whoa! [bumps into his doodle house and pulls over the blanket] What? Hey, where'd DoodleBob go?
Patrick: [being held by DoodleBob] Over here.
SpongeBob: Yipe! You let him go, Doodle!
[DoodleBob draws rope around Patrick. He babbles as he looms the pencil over SpongeBob, the tip near inches from his face. Then he draws a grave and a tombstone. He draws a coffin around SpongeBob and pushes him into the grave, burying him. DoodleBob drags Patrick and runs away with him. SpongeBob pops out from the grave.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
[SpongeBob draws a telescope and sees DoodleBob in his drawn castle tying his prisoner, Patrick, to a flagpole.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick! I'm coming for you! [runs over to DoodleBob's castle]
Patrick: [From the distance] Good to know!
SpongeBob: Surrender peacefully, DoodleBob, or face the wrath of...[draws his armor suit] SpongeBob, Knight of the Square Table! [jumps off his armor suit] Charge!
[DoodleBob launches flaming boulders with his catapult. SpongeBob dodges one.]
SpongeBob: Ha-ha! [a larger boulder crushes him]
[DoodleBob laughs. SpongeBob draws a door on the boulder and comes out unharmed.]
SpongeBob: Release my friend before I get really tough! [buffs up until his pecs get flabby]
[DoodleBob laughs and launches Patrick with the catapult.]
SpongeBob: [screams] I gotcha! I gotcha!
[Patrick crashes into SpongeBob.]
Both: Oof!
[DoodleBob then draws stamper and creates a whole army of DoodleBobs. They run out from the castle to attack SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run.]
Patrick: What are we gonna do?
SpongeBob: [takes off his shoe and draws a line] In here.
[SpongeBob and Patrick hide as DoodleBob and his army run past them. SpongeBob and Patrick come out.]
SpongeBob: Phew.
Patrick: [loudly] Nah-nah, you missed us! [through megaphone] Now you gotta kiss us!
[Patrick's idiotic outburst attracted DoodleBob's attention and commands his army to go back.]
Patrick: Nah-nah...
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: What? [gasps and realizes his mistake]
[DoodleBob babbles as SpongeBob and Patrick cry and hug each other.]
SpongeBob: Oh, we'll never get back home!
Patrick: We'll never see our balloon Squeaky again!
SpongeBob: Oh, Squeaky! [gasps] Squeaky! [takes off his show and draws a balloon] Grab on, buddy!
[SpongeBob and Patrick grab onto the balloon's string and they float away. DoodleBob attempts to grab them.]
SpongeBob: Too slow, DoodleBob!
[DoodleBob babbles.]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob.
[DoodleBob commands his army to connect with each other to make him high enough to reach SpongeBob and Patrick. Once they reach them, DoodleBob grabs the balloon's string. SpongeBob takes off his shoe and draws some scissors.]
SpongeBob: Here, Patrick!
Patrick: [grabs the scissors] Oh, ooh, uh... snip! [cuts the string and he and SpongeBob fall down]
[DoodleBob and his army float far away with the balloon until they are out of sight.]
SpongeBob: Well, that's the end of DoodleBob.
Patrick: But we're still stuck here.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Too bad Sandy isn't here. She'd find a way to get us back home. [gets an idea] Wait a minute, Patrick! [takes off his shoe and draws a doodle version of Sandy] Doodle us home, Sandy.
[Doodle Sandy takes SpongeBob's shoe and draws a vortex.]
Doodle Sandy: Bleeble blobble blortex!
Both: Yay! Thanks, Sandy!
Patrick: Whoo!
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter Doodle Sandy's vortex. Meanwhile, back at Sandy's treedome, Sandy is struggling to figure out a way to enter the vortex to retrieve SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sandy: Hmm, mm-hmm... [the vortex reactivates] What the—?
[SpongeBob and Patrick return home through the vortex, much to Sandy's shocking surprise.]
SpongeBob: Sandy, we're back!
[SpongeBob and Patrick dry up. They take deep breathes and put their water helmets on.]
Sandy: I ain't fixed the vortex yet! How in tarnation did you get back?
SpongeBob: Sandy saved us. [he and Patrick leave]
Sandy: [confused] What? [the old man's hand appears through the vortex and taps Sandy's shoulder] Huh? Huh?
Old coot: Give me back my nuts!
[Sandy gulps nervously. The screen turns black. DoodleBob appears and writes "The End" on the screen, ending the episode.]


[The camera zooms in to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [sees Mr. Krabs doing something] Mr. Krabs, what 'cha doin'?
Mr. Krabs: Oh ahoy, SpongeBob! I was just using some old toothpaste I found to patch up this small hole in the wall.
Squidward: [interrupts] Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that.
Mr. Krabs: And why is that, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Because then you'd only get to repair it once.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs both blink]
SpongeBob: So, what flavor is it?
Mr. Krabs: It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy. It doesn't have a flavor.
SpongeBob: No, I mean the toothpaste!
Mr. Krabs: Oh. Well I think it's... [Mr. Krabs notices the toothpaste drip, the wall cracks, and falls down]
SpongeBob: Hey, look Mr. Krabs! That small hole in the wall just became a medium-sized hole in the wall!
Squidward: Time to get out the dental floss. Ha! [cuts to a man and two boys riding in a boat, going to the Krusty Krab]
Boy 1: Thanks again for taking us to the Krusty Krab, dad.
Boy 2: Yeah. Mom never brings us here!
Frank: Ha. Any time kids. [notices the hole in the wall] What the?
[Mr. Krabs tries to put more toothpaste on]
SpongeBob: Careful now...
Frank: Hey, you guys put in a drive thru!
Mr. Krabs: [confused] We did?
Frank: Great, I'll have three large Krabby Patties, Krabby Fries, a Krabby Cola, and two extra large orders of Krabby Rings. [Notices the toothpaste on his hands and sniffs them] Is this toothpaste?
Mr. Krabs: [smirking] Boy, I don't know how I think think of this stuff, but I think I got a winner! We are putting in a drive thru!
SpongeBob: [amazed] A drive--- whoa!
Squidward: Sounds like a lot of extra work to me.
Mr. Krabs: You mean for you.
Squidward: [pounds the cash register] It'll cost you money.
Mr. Krabs: Oh nonsense, we'll build it for free!
[Cuts to Mr. Krabs outside looking through the hole]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob. What's with all the booty?
SpongeBob: I got this microphone system so we can hear what the customers order, this neat sign with a menu on it, and this colorful arrow so they know where to go. It even lights up, see? [Light turns on and Mr. Krabs is blinded, slightly unfazed]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's great SpongeBob, but I already got a bunch of stuff that's better: A menu board made with old napkins and packing tape, a microphone I made with some rusty tin cans I found, and this sign... I made from an old noodle.
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. How is this stuff better than the things I bought?
Mr. Krabs: [puts the first microphone cup up to SpongeBob's mouth as Mr. Krabs' ear is on the receiving end] I'm sorry, what?
SpongeBob: [shouts into the microphone cup] How is this stuff better?
Mr. Krabs: Because it was... [shakes the microphone to get a better signal] Free! [blows SpongeBob away with his loud voice]
[Bubble transition]
Frankie Billy: [pulls up to the drive thru in his boat] I'll have a medium fries, a large Krabby Patty, [takes the end of the menu for a closer look] and a medium drink.
Squidward: Comin' right up, sir. [walks to his workstation boat and places a note with an order on the kitchen window] SpongeBob, I need a medium fries, a large Krabby Patty, and a medium drink.
SpongeBob: I'll have that ready in two shakes in a lamprey's tail! [Laughs and then tries to deliver the order through the small hole in the hall, but struggles until accidentally dropping all the contents of the tray onto the ground outside. Makes an apologetic face as the customer is unsatisfied before coming up with a solution. He then comes outside and places a small trampoline next to the order hole while humming] That oughta' fix it! [Back inside the Krusty Krab, he dumps the order on the trampoline and it jumps and splatters the customer, who is visibly disappointed] Thank you, come again.
[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' office]
Mr. Krabs: [playing with his money and talking to it in a baby-tease voice] Yes, you like it here, don't you? [Billy walks in] Can I help you? [Billy gives Mr. Krabs a bill] A bill?! What's this for?
Frankie Billy: It's for my dry cleaning. It seems as though your new drive-through window is a little on the challenge side. [grease drips off of him] Size-wise, I mean.
Mr. Krabs: [Crashes the drive-through window with a mallet, increasing the size of the hole] There, problem solved! [Folds his arms smiling as Billy narrows his eyes]
French Narrator: [reads the time card] Meanwhile...
Squidward: [places an order on the note rack] SpongeBob, two large, two medium. I hate my job.
Dale: [at the drive thru window] Excuse me? I'd like to place an order please. [Squidward walks up there before he is interrupted by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, Squidward.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I am getting really tired of running back and forth. I find it both exhausting and time consuming.
Mr. Krabs: [Pushes the cash register boat beside the hole in the wall, then pushes the grill along with SpongeBob into his office, and finally pushes his chair into the kitchen. Then walks back to Squidward]
Squidward: [Sarcastically] Oh, wonderful. Peachy... Now how am I supposed to get to SpongeBob so I can hand him these order tickets here?
Mr. Krabs: [Smashes a hole to his office wall revealing SpongeBob; stars on a black screen are shown to emphasize the damage] Problem solved!
SpongeBob: Squidward! Hi!
Squidward: Oh it's days like this that make me wish I had gone to college.
Plankton: [Drives up in a small car] Now I'll be able to get a Krabby Patty the simplest way possible: [stops his car] By ordering one! [Laughs evilly] Ahem! I would like to order one Krabby Patty please! Uh, extra secret formula! [pauses] Hello?! Is this stupid thing on?!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! Any customers?
Squidward: None that I can hear.
Mr. Krabs: [Looks out the hole] Oh! Here comes one now!
Plankton: [notices the customer entering the drive thru] Hey. Hey! Go around! Go around! [Gets run over and squished; he screams]
Old man: Large Krabby Patty with fries please.
Squidward: [writes down his order in a notepad and responds via the tin can microphone] With fries. Got it. We'll have that right out to you sir.
Old Man: What? You're closed?! Now she tells me... [Drives off in anger]
Squidward: [Comes back with a bag] There you are sir. The ketchup's in the b-- [realizes there's no one there] What? Did somebody order a Krabby Patty? [Plankton slowly raises up his arm] Nobody, huh? Okay, I'll just toss it in the trash. [Walks away to do so off-screen. Plankton's arm goes down]
French Narrator: [reads time card] Later...
Pearl: [She and her friends enter the drive thru in their boat; they laugh] I sure am in a jovial mood! How about you guys? [Laughs again]
Girl 1: You bet, Pearl!
Girl 2: Oh, I'm feeling especially jovial. You know, being a teenager and all!
Squidward: [speaking through the microphone tin cans off-screen] Welcome to the Krusty Krab drive thru. Can I take your order?
Pearl: Hey, you guys. It sounds like that weird guy Squidward. What do you say we play a prank on him?
Girl 2: Ooh! Sounds like a great idea to me! Being a teenager and all! [Takes out a megaphone] Two large Krabby Patties, please! [Pause] With fries! [Giggles]
Squidward: [His left ear is shown pounding due to the pain inflicted; he is shown sweating. He holds his ear as he cries a bit] Owwwww! I'm not faking it you know. That really hurt. A lot.
[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs and Squidward in the kitchen; Mr. Krabs is shown sitting at his office desk; Squidward's ear is now bandaged]
Mr. Krabs: [holding a bill from Squidward] A bill?! And what is this for?
Squidward: [points to his bandaged ear] It's for my ear-replacement surgery! We need a real microphone and speaker!
Mr. Krabs: You have any idea how much a real microphone and speaker cost?!
Squidward: How much?
Mr. Krabs: Well... they cost as much as... as uh... as a... real microphone and... speaker.
French Narrator: [reads time card] Just then.
Larry: [drives his large S.U.B. into the tin can, breaking it in the process] Whoa, whoa. Woopsie!
Mr. Krabs: [Notices the tin can falling off] Hey! You delinquent! [goes back inside]
Squidward: Now you'll have to replace it.
Mr. Krabs: Replace what?
Squidward: The microphone!
Mr. Krabs: What do I look like, I'm made out of tin cans?
Squidward: No, but that pile of tin cans over there is. [Points to a pile of tin cans]
Mr. Krabs: Good thing we got you around to always point out the obvious.
Squidward: Good thing you're around to never notice the obvious!
Larry: [Watches Mr. Krabs fix the microphone] Sorry about that, dude.
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's nice! [Walks away but then comes back briefly to warn him] I'm still billing you for the damages!
SpongeBob: [Walks to the hole holding a Krabby Patty meal] One Krabby Meal! To go!
Larry: Hand it on up here!
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Larry! [Tries to hand the Krabby Meal up to Larry but struggles accompanied with grunts]
Larry: Come on, bro! You can do it! [SpongeBob continues to struggle until he falls out the hole and onto the ground, dropping the meal in the process, which splatters onto himself] Or maybe not.
SpongeBob: [Walks to Mr. Krabs while he is covered in food] Mr. Krabs, I'm concerned.
Mr. Krabs: Oh? Why, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Because I can't reach the window of Larry the Lobster's S.U.B.!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah... Well there's a solution to every problem! [Smashes another hole above the first one, revealing Larry's face] There! Problem solved! [Laughs. Hears honking noises] Hey! What's all the ruckourous about!? Whoa... [notices the long line of cars outside]
Millie: Hey! What's the hold up?!
Man 1: How long you gonna make us wait?!
Man 2: We're waiting here for hours!
Harold: We're still waiting... in our driveway!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! There's a line of customers out there a million miles long!
Squidward: [Sarcastically] That's nice. [shifts his attention to a red book he is reading] That's interesting.
Mr. Krabs: I guess I'll be retiring early after all! [Walks and laughs and then spots a policeman in the middle of where the boat register used to be]
Policeman: Mr. Eugene Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Yes? [The policeman hands him a ticket] What? Is this a-a-a ticket?!
Policeman: A ticket? [Laughs] Now why would I write you a ticket? Huh? Oh, I know! How about for turning the whole town into a parking lot?!
Mr. Krabs: Ah! But officer! I a... I a... Listen!
Policeman: Relax man, that's just my order. I want two Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go! [shows his badge] I don't wait in lines!
Mr. Krabs: Oh sure! Right! Phew! [Laughs] SpongeBob, can you get the kind officer two-
SpongeBob: [Appears with the bag of Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries] -Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go, sir? Anything for our boys in blue!
Mr. Krabs: [hands him the bag] There you go, officer! And thanks for being so understanding! If you know what I mean? No charge.
Policeman: [takes the bag] You're welcome. Just hope the mayor doesn't find out about this mess. He's the one you need to worry about! [Holds open the door letting the Mayor in] Mayor. [Leaves]
Mayor: Eugene Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [screams] Mr. Mayor!
Mayor: The whole town is in a stand-still because your drive thru is so slow!
Mr. Krabs: Well... don't you worry, Mr. Mayor! There's an answer for that, too! [Smashes another hole on the other side of the Krusty Krab] There you go! See, now we got two drive thrus, two lines, and I'll make money twice as fast! [Laughs]
Mayor: Hmm! That should work perfectly!
[Bubble transition to a bunch of boatmobiles surrounding the outside of the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob trying to deliver the numerous orders]
SpongeBob: Okay! Who had the Double Krabby Patty with fries and extra chee-? [The crowd angrily yells and tries to grab the food]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Order up!
SpongeBob: I'm on it! [Dashes over, takes the order ticket, and then starts grilling many Krabby Patties at the same time]
Squidward: Hurry, SpongeBob! I got 26 more orders!
SpongeBob: [Grows a bunch of arms, flips the patties, and comes out carrying a bunch of trays with orders on them] 26 orders up!
Squidward: [Running past SpongeBob] No, no, no! Not that window! The other one!
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you sure?! These customers over here look really, really hungry! [Spots a bunch of people in the window yelling]
Squidward: [Customers are biting on him] And these ones don't?!
Lenny: [Honks and suddenly gets hit from behind] Hey, hey, hey, watch it, will ya?! I just had this thing repainted!
Frank (lifeguard): And I just had this repainted! [Takes out a pipe-like object]
Lenny: [Scared] I see you used the extra-glossy...
Plankton: [Walking around holding chum] Chum nuggets here! Going fast! Get 'em while they're cold! Get 'em while they're runny! Looks like Krabs' drive thru is really paying off... [takes out some cash] for me! [Laughs evilly. Then spots something] Oh no... not again. [screams and gets run over by the same old man from earlier]
Old Man: Oh darn it! Now there's a line!
Plankton: [Gets up] Watch where you're going, old man! This is the second time!
Old Man: I'm too old to wait in lines! [Squashes Plankton a third time by backing up to leave]
Plankton: [takes out a chum nugget] Chum Nuggets... get 'em before [His arm breaks and the chum he is holding lands in his eye] my arm falls off...
Mr. Krabs: [gasps as he notices the enormous line of customers outside] They're everywhere!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Stay back! Take Squidward, not me! [Opens eyes and spots Squidward] Oh, hi Squidward.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! We gotta do something! The customers are mad with hunger! They're beginning to riot!
Squidward: For once, he's right!
Mr. Krabs: Easy, boys! Easy! Don't you think you're both getting a little carried away? I mean, I hardly call this a riot! Right? [Laughs] Like- [The Krusty Krab sign suddenly crashes through the window] Oh... kay... Don't worry! [takes out a sledgehammer] I can solve this! [runs over to the wall] More drive thrus! More money!
[Mr. Krabs smashes another hole in the Krusty Krab causing it to suddenly crack. All of the customers drive away screaming]
Mr. Krabs: [hears the cracking noise as the Krusty Krab begins to disintegrate] Hey? Is somebody eating potato chips?
[The Krusty Krab finally breaks apart, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob emerge from the rubble]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs! [Takes out the tube of toothpaste from earlier] We can fix it! [Squirts the rubble with the toothpaste, until the tube runs out] We might need to buy some more toothpaste though. [Mr. Krabs cries, ending the episode]


Narrator: It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: I'm ready! [walking up to Mrs. Puff's Boating School with Patrick] I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?
Patrick: Right here, buddy. [takes them out of his pocket] Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards. [eats the cards] Mmm.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick!
Patrick: Hey, learning tastes good.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I needed those.
Patrick: Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.
SpongeBob: 57 times.
Patrick: Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.
SpongeBob: I'm a winner?
Patrick: Who's a winner?
SpongeBob: [sadly] I'm a winner.
Patrick: Who's a winner?
SpongeBob: [cheered up a little] I'm a winner.
Patrick: Who's a winner?!
SpongeBob: I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! [runs into the classroom]
Narrator: One minute thirty seven seconds later... [SpongeBob walks up crying]
Patrick: How'd you do, winner? [SpongeBob's crying continues] Let's see that license.
SpongeBob: I didn't get a license, Patrick.
Patrick: Are they gonna mail it to you?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.
Patrick: No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.
SpongeBob: Let's just go home, Patrick.
Patrick: We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.
SpongeBob: [hanging onto Patrick's pants] No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. [Patrick's pants rip off]
Patrick: Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. No!
Mrs. Puff: [Patrick walks up to the boat she is sitting in and gets in it, in his underwear] Good morning.
Patrick: You're not the judge of me!
Mrs. Puff: Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! [clicks her pen. Scene cuts to SpongeBob, outside the boating school]
SpongeBob: I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?
Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I'm here for you, buddy.
Patrick: I passed my test!
SpongeBob: You got a perfect score?
Patrick: Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.
SpongeBob: Perfect score. [eye twitches]
Patrick: Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. [scene cuts to the license registration building]
Miss Shell: Stand behind the line, sir.
Patrick: [smiling] How do I look?
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Like a winner.
Miss Shell: Ready?
Patrick: Ready. [banner comes down which says "CONGRATULATIONS" on it. Balloons and confetti fall]
SpongeBob: Huh?
Fish: Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.
Patrick: Does that mean I get a free key chain?
Fish: Uhh, no.
Patrick: Oh.
Fish: You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.[Patrick runs up to the new boatmobile as SpongeBob's jaw drops]
Patrick: Yeah! All right!
Fish: Women will want you. [all sigh] Men will want to be you. [all faint] You'll be the envy of your friends. [SpongeBob growling angrily]
Patrick: Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.
SpongeBob: I'm so happy for you... ["La Cucaracha" horn blows in his face] Whoa!
Patrick: The horn works. [scene cuts to Patrick driving his new boat down the road] Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
Patrick: Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.
SpongeBob: Two millionth?
Patrick: Then you can get a free boat just like me.
SpongeBob: Yeah, just like you.
Patrick: I try to serve as an inspiration to others.
SpongeBob: Can we go home now? [zoom out and scene shows Patrick driving around his rock over and over] We've been driving around your house for hours.
Patrick: I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. [shudders then drives off. SpongeBob imitates Patrick. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in bed asleep. His clock turns to 3:00am when an engine revving is heard which sends SpongeBob into his diving board then back into his bed]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. [SpongeBob groans and slam his window shut, breaking it, before going back to bed. Scene cuts to 4:00am]
SpongeBob: 4:00? [yawns. Doorbell rings] Who could be at the door at this hou— [falls down the stairs. Opens the door] Now what is it, Patrick?
Patrick: You will never guess what happen to me today.
SpongeBob: You got your license.
Patrick: Yeah! [shows his license] But that's not all.
SpongeBob: You got a new boat.
Patrick: Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. [walks off]
SpongeBob: [gets back into bed] Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. [foghorn alarm blows]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat. [scene cuts to morning where SpongeBob is leaving home to go to work] I'm so tired. [horn honks]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. [tries to take a step, but falls down in the process. Scene cuts to Patrick driving SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride.
Patrick: No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. [SpongeBob is getting very angry]
SpongeBob: That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.
SpongeBob: When did we get a drive-thru?
Mr. Krabs: I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.
SpongeBob: I used to have a dream.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.
SpongeBob: [through headphones] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— ["La Cucaracha" horn honks]
Patrick: The horn still works. [scene cuts to SpongeBob switching the OPEN sign to CLOSED then walking out of work. Patrick drives up in a racing uniform] Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What's with the helmet, Patrick?
Patrick: Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. [clicks tongue]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [scene cuts to Patrick driving]
Patrick: Boy, driving is so easy.
SpongeBob: Oh?
Patrick: Do you want me to give you lessons?
SpongeBob: [sarcastic] Oh, that would be great.
Patrick: Oh! [drives over to SpongeBob's parents]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.
Mr. SquarePants: Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?
Patrick: What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.
Mrs. SquarePants: That's great, Patrick.
Patrick: SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.
SpongeBob: Mom!
Patrick: Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.
SpongeBob: Hey. [Patrick drives off]
Mr. SquarePants: Even Patrick has a license. [both parents sigh]
Patrick: Let's see what this baby can do. [steps on the gas. Ride pass a sign that reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH']
SpongeBob: Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
Patrick: Yeah, yeah.
SpongeBob: [reads the speedometer] 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. [car stops next to a policeman]
Patrick: What? Where? Who?
SpongeBob: Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
Officer: Umm... okay. [uses radar gun. It reads 0mph] Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. [drives off]
SpongeBob: Are you sure you don't want to run him in? [scene cuts to Patrick driving. Green light turns red] It's a red light, Patrick! [Patrick runs through red lights] Patrick, you just ran three red lights!
Patrick: So?
SpongeBob: You're suppose to stop!
Patrick: I think the driving genius knows what he's doing.
SpongeBob: [finally snaps] Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
Patrick: They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?
SpongeBob: I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
Patrick: How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!
SpongeBob: If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
Patrick: I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! [takes out license and rubs it in SpongeBob's face--literally--which makes muffled noises]
SpongeBob: [fixes his face and then snatches Patrick's license out of his hand]Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! [tears up Patrick's license then laughs. The pieces of the license fly into the cop's hands.]
Officer: Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. [drives off after SpongeBob &amp; Patrick]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: It's the police!
Officer: [over speaker] Pull it over, litterbug!
Patrick: Litterbug?! No! [drives faster]
Officer: Ooh, I got me a runner. [a bunch of police cars are following him]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
Patrick: I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. [drives around cards, through a sign then off a cliff into the front lot of the Bikini Bottom Jail. Scene cuts to courtroom]
Judge: 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.
Patrick: So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.
SpongeBob: What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait! [runs up to the judge] Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
Judge: Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! [a smiling SpongeBob is put in jail]
Narrator: One debt to society later... [door buzzes. SpongeBob is let go out of jail where Patrick is waiting for him]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob! [both hug]
SpongeBob: I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever. [shows him a license plate that reads "PALS 4 EVER"] Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.
Patrick: Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.
SpongeBob: Oh, then what do we do with this? [Patrick takes it and puts it on his behind]
Patrick: How's that?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Patrick: Ready, buddy?
SpongeBob: Ready, pal. [hops on Patrick's shoulders and makes car noises] Woo! Woo!


[It's another great day in Bikini Bottom. Gary is out in a clearing and SpongeBob tiptoes over to a rock behind him giggling. He looks from behind it]
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got ya now, Gary.
Gary: Meow? [SpongeBob jumps up and lands in mid-air. He touches Gary's shell with his index finger]
SpongeBob: Tag, you're it! [he runs off, SpongeBob jumps and he opens his mouth. He flies to his house and chomps down on the side of it, leaving him clinging. garbled] Gary will never find me here! [Gary crawls over the ground, up the house and toward SpongeBob] Uh-oh. [Gary's eye substitutes as an arm as he tags SpongeBob and meows] Tag! Now I'm it! [he laughs uncontrollably as he slides down the wall, scraping off two slices of the covering with his teeth. Patrick is below and SpongeBob takes the shavings out of his teeth]
Patrick: Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Gary and I are playing tag. You wanna join us?
Patrick: Oh boy, would I!
SpongeBob: [slyly] Okay, [touches him] Tag, you're it! [walks away]
Patrick: I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it! [Gary is still there, and he meows. Patrick tags him] Tag, you're it! I win, I win! [Gary purrs and rubs against Patrick. Then he crawls all around Patrick's body. SpongeBob walks over] What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat! [laughs]
SpongeBob: That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!
Patrick: [laughs] It tickles! [the two laugh endlessly as Gary continues to crawl around. They continue laughing and laughing until it's dark]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gare-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary. [he pulls Gary off of Patrick and walks away] Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay. [Patrick waves] What about you, Gary? [SpongeBob sees that he's no longer holding Gary] Gary? Gary? [cut to Patrick's house where the rock is up and Patrick's brushing his teeth and looking in a mirror on the side of the wall. He has his nightcap on]
Patrick: [singing] Brush brush brush, brush brush brush… [SpongeBob walks over]
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, have you seen Gary?
Patrick: [singing] Brush brush brush, [he brushes under his armpit] Brushin' everywhere… [he spits and turns around. We see Gary attached to his stomach] Nope. [looks down] Oh, hey, here he is! [Gary purrs and meows]
SpongeBob: Come on Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep.
Patrick: Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?
SpongeBob: Hey, that's a great idea!
Patrick: A sleep-over! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games… [SpongeBob thinks to himself and we hear Patrick in the background saying, "Blah blah blah blah…"]
SpongeBob: Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover.
Patrick: And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books…
SpongeBob: OK, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow. [they wave good-bye and SpongeBob walks home]
Patrick: Blah blah blah blah blah… [soon, night becomes day and SpongeBob wakes up to his foghorn alarm clock]
SpongeBob: I'm awake!
Patrick: [off-screen] Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob leaps up and runs to the window. Patrick and Gary are outside]
SpongeBob: Hey, guys, how was the sleepover?
Patrick: Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows! [he pulls Gary off his chest and runs. Gary goes after him as he runs around SpongeBob's house. He runs on top of his house and falls off and continues running, which Gary then imitates] See? [SpongeBob jumps from the window and runs off]
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee! [laughs] Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me? [he notices he's not being chased] You're not chasing me… [Gary is still with Patrick]
Patrick: Come on, Gary, let's play a different game. [he and Gary walk away. SpongeBob jumps in front of Gary]
SpongeBob: Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of… [Gary crawls away after Patrick] …you… What's wrong with me? [he sniffs his armpit] Do I offend? [Patrick is playing with Gary, Gary is crawling on Patrick's toes. Patrick's on his back and laughing while Gary purrs. SpongeBob runs inside the house and brings out a ball covered in snail slime] Hey, Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball! [Gary is sitting on Patrick's bum and Patrick shakes it, laughing. SpongeBob drops the ball. Gary is now crawling up to Patrick's armpit. SpongeBob pulls a can of snail nip] Hey, Gary, look! Snail-nip! [he eats some] Huh? Huh-huh? [Gary is too busy crawling on Patrick's head to notice. SpongeBob decides to try something else, he runs inside and hangs from the window by his head] Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh, merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head! [Gary is on his shell rolling Patrick left and right] All right, that's it! [The window opens and SpongeBob falls. Gary is now rolling on Patrick's belly. SpongeBob walks up to them] Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now. [Gary's eyes lower] Gary the Snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me this instant! [SpongeBob struggles and pulls Gary off Patrick] Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary. [he walks off, Gary lets out a meow of sadness]
Patrick: Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!
SpongeBob: What's that supposed to mean?
Patrick: I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. Now, I suggest that you put him down and let him choose. [SpongeBob does so]
SpongeBob: Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him. Okay, Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary! [Gary turns around to Patrick] Uh, wrong way, Gary. [Ignoring, Gary is crawling toward Patrick] G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary! [he collapses as Gary crawls up to Patrick]
Patrick: Well, well, well… I guess that answers that question. [SpongeBob's eyes well up] So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do.
SpongeBob: [angrily, to Gary] Okay, fine, if that's how you want to thank me… [whimpers] ...for all that I've done?! [Patrick's rock falls down into place. Cut to SpongeBob's darkened room where SpongeBob is on his bed looking down at Gary's bowl. He sheds a tear into it] I guess you're not coming back, Gary. [angrily] I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend! [cut to Patrick running around laughing with Gary on his head. SpongeBob walks by with a giant worm by the leash. The worm is bluish green and is panting heavily] Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex! [Rex barks, SpongeBob pats him] Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks, too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit! [he waits, but Rex is just sitting there] Roll over, Rex, roll over! [Rex just sits there again] Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? [Patrick laughs and dances with Gary on his head] I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me. [loudly so Gary can hear] So loyal, so trusting, always by my side! [Rex barks and we see he's waiting for the bus across the street with a hitch-hiking hole with stuff in it. The bus comes and he rides off. Cut to SpongeBob entering the house with a pet carrying case] Who needs worms anyway? [SpongeBob puts down the case and opens the door] Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy. [a snail comes out. It's got big bushy black eyebrows and a tan shell, with the same design as Gary's] You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone whose name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary.
Lary: [in a deeper voice than Gary's] Meow. [Cut to Lary sitting at a table as SpongeBob walks over with a plate with a cover on it. SpongeBob is in chef garb]
SpongeBob: And now, Lary, I present to you… dinner time! Ta-da. [he takes off the cover, it's snail food in Gary's bowl. But the Gary inscription now has an L written over the G] Bon appetite, Lary. [giggles. Lary sniffs it and hisses. SpongeBob quickly takes the bowl away, scared] Okay, maybe later. [walks backward. Cut to SpongeBob with his robe on, showing Lary the newspaper bed next to his own] This is where you sleep, Lary. [Lary goes over on it, hisses, and tears it up. Lary is now up on SpongeBob's bed] Uh, that's where I… [Lary hisses loudly and falls asleep instantly] I guess you can sleep there… [SpongeBob lays down on the shredded newspaper] I'll sleep down here. [lays some shreds on him like a blanket] Well, good night, Lary. [Lary hisses again. Cut to morning where Lary is watching TV. SpongeBob jumps in upside down and surprises him, causing him to hide in his shell] Hey, Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one! [clears throat] What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor! [laughs, Lary hisses and crawls away] Don't you get it, Lary? A snailor. [he deflates then he stands up] Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry. [he holds a real-life snail from his pocket. He looks at a photo of Gary] Oh, Gary, why did you have to go?! [cries] Why, Gary?! Why…?! Why, why, why, why, why, why?! [we hear Gary meow] Gary? [we see Patrick and Gary are behind him. Patrick is holding a basket of laundry]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Patrick.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Hello, Gary.
Patrick: Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?
SpongeBob: Laundry? But… we used to do laundry…
Patrick: And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?
SpongeBob: Soap? But… we used to use soap. [holds up two bottles] Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'… [tears up]
Patrick: Here it comes…
SpongeBob: Du… du… duuuuu… [cries] ttyyyyy! [his tears make both of the bottles bubble up] Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you! [stops crying] I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want. [runs up to the sofa and tears it up furiously] If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up! [runs up to the litter box] And the litter box? Forget about it! [he dumps the litter on his head] The world is your litter box! [he runs to the fridge and opens it] And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access! [he takes a milk carton and drinks it] And you don't even have to use a bowl! [he runs to a giant carving of Squidward] And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward. [scratches at it] Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary? [we see SpongeBob has carved Squidward into a heart]
Patrick: How pathetic…
SpongeBob: Gary…? [the heart breaks in half and one half hits him. The two walk to the laundry room]
Patrick: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it, SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself. [he takes off his shorts and puts them in the machine; Gary crawls in after them] It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary? [the two notice Gary is in the machine, nudging in Patrick's shorts] He only liked me for my shorts!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket! [Gary is indeed eating the cookie. He finishes and crawls out up to SpongeBob]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: G-G-Gary? [Gary burps and happily meows] Whee! [he hugs Gary] Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me! Aww… [giggles, he takes his leash] Let's go for a walk, pal! [the two walk out.]
Patrick: Gary? I thought what we had was special...!


[Squidward is dressed in island clothes and playing the piano on an island (the future version of Bikini Bottom). He hits one of the notes, but realizes it's a sour note and he keeps hitting it. The sound is coming from SpongeBob hitting a bell.]
Dream SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward! [Squidward wakes up from his dream while his alarm clock goes off. Cuts to Squidward driving to work. Zooms in on one of his bumper stickers that reads "Don't Ask Me About My Day." Squidward blearily looks up from his steering wheel to prepare himself for the day ahead. He walks up to the front doors and SpongeBob follows him from inside, smiling. Squidward walks inside]
SpongeBob: Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me? [Squidward walks inside without saying a word] Okay, see you later, Squidinator.
Mr. Krabs: Good morning, Mr. Squidward. [Raises his eyebrows; Squidward sticks out his tongue] So, are you ready?
Squidward: To go home?
Mr. Krabs: No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards... [points at SpongeBob] ...that guy! [SpongeBob is washing a table with a buffer. He scrubs his face and gets it scrambled. He laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for ye.
SpongeBob: Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift. [holds up a sweater] Ta-dah. [zooms in to show it's a picture of a heart with Squidward's face on it]
Squidward: "I Heart you..."
Mr. Krabs: Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it. [laughs as Squidward has a hard time putting the sweater over his head]
SpongeBob: I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size. [Squidward gets the sweater over his head] Do you love it?
Squidward: [starts scratching the sweater] It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of? [cut to SpongeBob with no eyelashes or eyebrows]
SpongeBob: Eyelashes! [Squidward throws the sweater at SpongeBob, causing him to whimper]
Squidward: Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?
Mr. Krabs: After you present your brotherhood gift.
Squidward: I'll buy the little twerp a Gumball.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift.
Squidward: [walks to the doors] The only thing I'm making is for the exit. [opens up the door to see SpongeBob with a new sweater made out of a clear liquid]
SpongeBob: Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears. [sniffs. Squidward sighs and walks towards the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice.
Squidward: Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?
Captain: Heave-ho! [Squidward looks and sees some pirates outside carrying some pies onto the ship] If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!
Squidward: Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.
Pirate: Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs.
Squidward: Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one. [holds up money]
Captain: Wait! [jumps down off the ship] We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please.
Squidward: So, what flavor is it?
Pirates: [all talking at once] Cherry. Apple. Raspberry.
Squidward: Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back. [Squidward gives the pirate the money. Cut to Squidward placing the pie on Mr. Krabs' desk] Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.
Mr. Krabs: Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right. [about to put a piece in his mouth] Wait a second... this would go great with some milk! [while walking to the milk, he trips over a book and the piece of pie flies into the milk, causing an explosion] So, you tried to kill me over a little new age management, eh?
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain! [cut to inside Mr. Krabs' office]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie! [looks at the card attached to it] It's from Squidward. [reading] "To SpongeBob... Well, here you go."
Squidward: And that's what happened!
Mr. Krabs: 25 dollars?! A bomb?!
Squidward &amp; Mr. Krabs: [shouting] In the Krusty Krab?! [both run back into the office but the pie is not there]
Mr. Krabs: That's where you left it.
Squidward: It's not there.
SpongeBob: Hey guys. [licks his fingers then rubs his tummy] Thanks for the pie, Squidward. [sings] La, la, lalalalalala. [skips out]
Mr. Krabs: You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears... and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?
Squidward: Kill him? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob taking a tray to a customer]
SpongeBob: Here's your order, sir.
Customer: Thanks. [SpongeBob explodes and pieces of SpongeBob fly everywhere; back to reality]
Squidward: No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!
Mr. Krabs: Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!
Squidward: You've seen this before?
Mr. Krabs: Eleven times as a matter of fact. [Squidward runs over to a phone and dials the hospital]
Squidward: Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times? [hangs up] Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him? [both look out the window and see SpongeBob cheerfully wiping off a table, apparently having forgotten about the earlier incident]
Mr. Krabs: Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours. [walks away]
Squidward: [tears up] You're right, Mr. Krabs! [sobs] I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it. [opens the door then turns around, smiling] Drown in it! [walks out]
Mr. Krabs: [writes on a notepad] Note to self: Watch out for Squidward. [Cut to Squidward walking over to SpongeBob, who is singing happily and wiping the table]
Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [sing-songy] Yes?
Squidward: I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift.
SpongeBob: Part two? [bounces up and down] Part two, part two, part two, part two... [Squidward grabs him]
Squidward: Please, don't do that.
SpongeBob: What's the part two?
Squidward: Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of? [SpongeBob takes out a list]
SpongeBob: Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list.
Squidward: Great. Uh, let me see it. [looks at the list]
SpongeBob: The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.
Squidward: Everything's in red.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I know.
Squidward: We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.
SpongeBob: Then let's roll! [both walk out] Bye, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs cries and puts a "Help Wanted" sign in the window] Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you.
Squidward: Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.
SpongeBob: Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to a businessman] Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward talking to some kids] Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward. [one of the kids throws a rock at Squidward's head. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking up to a fish sitting on a bench] Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward.
Squidward: Hey, Frank. [montage ends] Glad that's over.
SpongeBob: Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity.
Squidward: Which is...?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.
Squidward: You're gonna be wearing a salmon suit?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one Squidward! [cut to Squidward in a salmon suit in front of some kids. All the kids throw rocks at him. Cut to SpongeBob checking off the item on his list] Next. [SpongeBob and Squidward sit by a rock] Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.
Squidward: Who's there?
SpongeBob: I am! [laughs]
Squidward: [laughs weakly] Oh, yeah... [SpongeBob checks the knock-knock jokes off his list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward walking backwards]
SpongeBob: [imitates the beeping of a back up alarm] Look out, everyone, friends in reverse! [continues beeping. SpongeBob checks off this item off the list. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward making noises with their tongues out of their mouths while moving their hands back and forth in front of their face. SpongeBob checks the item off his list. Cut to Squidward walking with SpongeBob as his face]
SpongeBob: Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.
Squidward:  [muffled] I can't breathe. [SpongeBob checks that off his list. Cut to SpongeBob performing open-heart surgery on Squidward]
Squidward: Are you sure you should be poking it like that?
SpongeBob: Who's the doctor here? [heart squirts blood. SpongeBob checks his operation off the list as well as some other items while he laughs] The last thing on the list is...
Squidward: [with a bandage over his heart] Does it involve more dismemberment?
SpongeBob: Watch the sunset with Squidward.
Squidward: Sunset? [thinks about what Mr. Krabs said earlier in a thought balloon]
Mr. Krabs: The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.
SpongeBob: Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs cries and runs off] Okay, see you later.
Squidward: C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.
SpongeBob: Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me, [a brick wall is shown between the two] ...and this brick wall that you built between us.
Squidward: Yeah. [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward? [Squidward imagines SpongeBob exploding]
Squidward: Explosions... I mean, erosion. 
SpongeBob: You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay. [Squidward tears up. SpongeBob burps] Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine. [smells the aroma] Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry? [the sun starts to go down] Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.
Squidward: Four... three... two... one... [nothing happens]
SpongeBob: I guess we started too early. Let's start again.
Squidward: Five... four... three... [an explosion is heard from behind the wall] two... [cries] o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful. [he sighs] I am such a good person. [another explosion is seen behind the wall but this time, it knocks the brick wall down on top of Squidward. SpongeBob is blowing some bomb-shaped bubbles]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out! [Squidward gets up and mutters] Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.
Squidward: Why are you still here?!
SpongeBob: Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one. [holds up a book that says "Friends 4 Ever"] I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.
Squidward: [slaps book away] Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!
SpongeBob: You want me to explode?
Squidward: Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!
SpongeBob: Um, okay, I'll try. [grunts and then yells] Gary! You are gonna finish your desert, and you are gonna like it! [laughs] Now it's your turn!
Squidward: [yells and stomps on the ground] That's not what I meant you barnacle head!
SpongeBob: Oh, good one.
Squidward: No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces! [he flaps his arms]
SpongeBob: Why would I do that?
Squidward: Because the pie you ate was a bomb!
SpongeBob: What pie?
Squidward: The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!
SpongeBob: Pie...pie... [takes out a pie] Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat! [walks forward and trips on a rock] Oops! [pie flies into Squidward's face in slow-motion causing an explosion the size of an atomic bomb]
Squidward: [now in the destroyed town] Ouch. [fade to black, episode ends]


SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Do you know what today is?
Squidward: Annoy Squidward Day?
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, silly! [gets out a calendar] That's on the 15th! [day is marked by a picture of Squidward's head] Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.
Squidward: SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs gives you that award, so you'll work harder for no extra money.
SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too if you tried harder.
Squidward: Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame? [shows wall full of SpongeBob pictures for being Employee of the Month]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.
Mr. Krabs: Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner! [whispering] Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout. [shows Squidward reading a magazine] There might be a new face on the wall this month.
SpongeBob: Huh? [looks over and sees the month of "January" with no picture]
Squidward: That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you. [Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh at SpongeBob as he walks over to the wall and imagines Squidward laughing at him in the picture]
SpongeBob: Nooo! [begins to sob] How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?! [Squidward's picture continues to laugh. Scene goes to SpongeBob grilling and flipping patties until he comes to a patty that won't flip. He tries and tries, but then he flips the patty on to the ceiling. He then tries to get it off of there.]
Squidward: [peeks in] Need some help? [SpongeBob screams] What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Making...Krabby Patties?
Squidward: You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of-- [SpongeBob gets the patty off the ceiling, but he flings it into the fan and it sprays Squidward with all the meat] ...garbage.
SpongeBob: [jumps off of ceiling] Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!
Squidward: I already told you, that award is a bunch of... [gets sprayed with meat again] ...baloney!
SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...
Squidward: [grabs SpongeBob's hat] It's a symbol that you're a chump! [SpongeBob screams, feeling scared]
SpongeBob: No, Squidward! [screams]
Squidward: And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award! [Squidward lifts his foot and tries to stomp the hat flat, but his foot hits something hard that is under the hat] Ow!
SpongeBob: [lifts up the hat to reveal a lead block] An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
Squidward: I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke! [Squidward walks away, but is sprayed with meat for the last time. Then we see SpongeBob looking at all his award photos]
SpongeBob: What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?! [every award photo now has an army hat on]
SpongeBob Picture: Stow that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That's exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!
SpongeBob: But, sir…
SpongeBob Picture: There's no room for "buts" in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing--and I mean nothing--to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?
SpongeBob: Crystal, sir!
SpongeBob Picture: Good! Now move out! [SpongeBob marches away and then we see SpongeBob looking through his windows through binoculars while Squidward gets ready for bed]
SpongeBob: I won't let Squidward win! [Squidward sets his alarm and walks off] He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited. [SpongeBob sneaks up to Squidward's house by sliding on the ground then through one of Squidward's windows and as he enters he falls to the ground and Squidward's hears the noise while he is brushing his teeth. Squidward goes to check what it is and SpongeBob is standing behind the plant by the door. Squidward closes the door and SpongeBob slides around the door and then by Squidward's bed where the alarm clock is. He is about to grab it when he hears the door handle jiggle so he hides in the pillow on the bed. Squidward gets into bed and isn't comfortable with the pillow as it is so he adjusts it. Tries to adjust it again and you can hear SpongeBob's giggling. Squidward lays his head down and SpongeBob's hand reaches out for the clock as Squidward opens his eyes. Squidward freaks out and throws the pillow against the wall. The cover comes down, revealing SpongeBob]
Squidward: SpongeBob! What are you doing here?! [SpongeBob grabs alarm clock]
SpongeBob: You can't win that award if you don't get up for work! [SpongeBob destroys the clock. Squidward grabs another one and sets it on the stand. SpongeBob grabs that one and destroys it. Squidward opens up a closet full of alarm clocks. SpongeBob grabs a few clocks and destroys them one by one]
Squidward: Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!
SpongeBob: [tosses the destroyed alarm clock over his shoulder] That can be arranged.
Squidward: You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.
Squidward: Are y-Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!
SpongeBob: I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.
Squidward: Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm gonna show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm gonna be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!
SpongeBob: Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!
Squidward: Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!
SpongeBob: Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!
Squidward: I don't need to sleep! Loser!
SpongeBob: Well, me neither! …26-time loser! [SpongeBob and Squidward are watching each other through their windows] Look at him. Watchin' me.
Squidward: I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?
Squidward: No, how about you?
SpongeBob: Nope! [Squidward gets out his clarinet and plays "Brahms' Lullaby". SpongeBob struggles to keep himself awake.] Nighty Night. [SpongeBob falls asleep and starts to snore. Later, Squidward tries to walk out, but falls into a very deep square hole right in front of his door]
Squidward: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes up with a shovel in his hand]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?
Squidward: I'm going to wring you dry when I get outta here! Now get me outta here!
SpongeBob: All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [Squidward screams some more. SpongeBob walks back to bed] 
SpongeBob: Now to get some rest. Don't wanna look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo! [SpongeBob goes to his bed and sleeps a while. Squidward manages to climb out of the hole; SpongeBob wakes up to hear some hammering] Squidward! [Squidward is nailing boards onto SpongeBob's front door] 
Squidward: That oughta hold him! [SpongeBob saws around it and pushes the door on Squidward and runs away. A cage drops enclosing SpongeBob and Squidward laughs. SpongeBob slides out because he can fit through the bars]
Squidward: [walks along into a bottle and gets trapped] SpongeBob! Why, you little…! [SpongeBob writes "loser." on the bottle with his finger in a script writing and runs away. Later he sees a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty! [smells it but the top bun opens up and a claw comes out grabbing SpongeBob's nose] Ow! Squidward!
Squidward: So long, Sponge loser! [Squidward gets caught in a net and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob runs through a barbed-wire fence and Squidward runs by laughing. Squidward is tied by his tentacles and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob is stuck in a brick wall and Squidward runs by laughing. Later the two are trying to drag along some big items. SpongeBob is dragging an anchor and Squidward is dragging a flaming boat] SpongeBob? Truce? [both wave a white flag]
SpongeBob: Truce.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!
SpongeBob: You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it. [it’s now dawn]
Squidward: Okay, let's have a good clean fight.
SpongeBob: And may the better man win. [shakes hands with Squidward, now he's thinking] He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!
Squidward: [thinking] Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.
SpongeBob: [thinking] As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
Squidward: [thinking] ...I'm gonna make a run for it.
[SpongeBob and Squidward stop shaking hands, laugh nervously, and hastily run for the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is opening it up]
Mr. Krabs: Money, money, gonna make some money! [sees SpongeBob and Squidward come running over] Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early! [Mr. Krabs realizes that they aren't stopping for anything] Wait! [both push Mr. Krabs out of the way and start doing nice stuff]
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!
Squidward: Clean tables, Mr. Krabs! [Squidward presses too hard on the table while he is cleaning and breaks it in half]
SpongeBob: Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What's going on here?! [SpongeBob drops and breaks the dishes and mops them just like that]
SpongeBob: It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: No!
Squidward: Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob puts his money into the register. Squidward and SpongeBob are in the kitchen] Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!
Squidward: There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I'll easily double your output, SpongeHog!
Mr. Krabs: Boys, boys, boys! [music gradually speeds up; both SpongeBob and Squidward make many patties to overflow the kitchen, cornering Mr. Krabs] Help! Help! [the amount of Krabby Patties fills up the kitchen and the Krusty Krab itself, causing the whole restaurant to explode, sending thousands of patties raining down in front of the citizens]
Frank: Hey, free Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: [with his head bursting through one of SpongeBob's employee pictures] Wait, you've got to pay for those! Wait! Wait! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! [SpongeBob and Squidward come through the picture frame that Mr. Krabs is in and ask him who is the winner, while Mr. Krabs is still complaining about the Krabby Patties]
SpongeBob: So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?
Squidward: Me, me! It's me! [SpongeBob and Squidward continue calling out simultaneously about who is the winner]
Mr. Krabs: Boys! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!


[Starts at Squidward's house. He walks up and puts on his hat. Opens his door]
Squidward: Okay, beloved sanctuary. [lifts a tentacle] I'll see you after work. [cuts to "Beloved Sanctuary"] And we'll have a nice, relaxing evening. [cuts to Squidward] Just you and me. [slams door] That is, Of course, if I can survive another day [walks across his lawn] with GratingBob ShrillPants.
Patrick: [cuts to Patrick and SpongeBob] OOH!
SpongeBob: [laughing]
[Patrick throws a big rock onto SpongeBob with his body. Patrick and SpongeBob laugh]
Squidward: Hm. [Walks towards Krusty Krab] Wow. Those two are just so amazingly stupid.
SpongeBob: [grunts]
[Patrick is thrown, bending Squidward's neck. SpongeBob jumps on Squidward's broken neck, laughing. Squidward falls. Squidward gets up and fixes his neck]
Squidward: Grrr!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both laugh]
[Patrick rolls next to SpongeBob and throws him by the legs]
SpongeBob: [screams]
[Patrick walks up and he and SpongeBob laugh. Cuts to Squidward. SpongeBob throws Patrick and laughs]
SpongeBob: Ahh. Isn't this fun?
Patrick: Yeah! I love playing Buddy Toss! [Squidward walks past them]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! See you at work!
[cuts to Krusty Krab. Shows Squidward reading a newspaper]
SpongeBob: Ow! [This causes Squidward's newspaper to fly out of his hands]
[SpongeBob laughs]
[SpongeBob squirts mustard into Patrick's eyes]
Patrick: Ow!
[room rumbles]
Squidward: [groans] Okay. I can do this. Just put them out of my mi...
SpongeBob: Ow! [laughs]
French Narrator: One extremely annoying shift later...
Squidward: [screams and runs into his house. Locks door using every type of lock. Comes to crossword puzzle] A nine-letter word for annoying: SpongeBob. [writes "SpongeBob" on crossword] Ugh. [Wipes his face] Finally. Some peace and quiet. [Takes off hat. Puts feet into slippers] No more SpongeBob, Just me, myself and home sweet home. [Sits on chair] Ahh. Nothing like a squid's good ol' chair to soothe the pains of a rough day. Just relax and contemplate some me time. [Walks to record player and disc] Perhaps I will dance to some soothing dance records. [Puts disc on player and snaps fingers to the beat as well as dances] Or I could dabble a little on painting! [walks to paint and pallet. Paints. Sighs.] Yup. I sure am looking forward to it. [eel sting]
SpongeBob: [laughs]
[eel sting]
[Laughter]
[eel sting]
[more laughter]
Squidward: No, no, no! [walks to window and sees SpongeBob stinging Patrick with an electric eel. They laugh and Squidward growls and exits his house]
SpongeBob: Something Squidward this way comes.
Squidward: Alright, you two. I am trying to having a relaxing evening. What in the world are you doing out here?
Patrick: Trying to have a relaxing evening.
SpongeBob: We're playing flashlight tag.
Squidward: You're playing flashlight tag with an electric eel?
SpongeBob: We're using the advanced rules.
Squidward: Advanced rules? [growls] That has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever-
[Patrick grabs the electric eel and has it sting Squidward who screeches]
Patrick: You're it.
[Squidward gets a rash then screams and runs away.]
SpongeBob: Oh, well played, Patrick!
[Squidward runs home, sobbing hysterically and rams into his house wall, becoming dazed, and the window rings fall at him and then the nose crushes him. Squidward digs his way into his house]
Patrick: Shocking!
Electric Eel: [sarcastically] How original.
[cuts to Squidward's house where he is under his chair in a fetal position]
Squidward: [crying] All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax in peace [sniffs] and quiet.  Is that too much to ask? [sniffles again. SpongeBob pokes Squidward's head with a stick. Squidward tearfully looks up at him and Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, we're playing tag! Not hide and seek, you silly!
Patrick: But we like hide and seek too, if you want to play that.
Squidward: [still crying] All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax [sniffs] in peace! [quietly whimpers. SpongeBob finally realizes something is wrong with Squidward]
SpongeBob: Patrick, Squidward is really really sad...
Patrick: You're right. Let's go poke someone else. [SpongeBob thinks]
SpongeBob: How about instead, we do something extra special for him! Then he won't be sad anymore!
Patrick: Oh, I get it. It'll be like the time I was feeling impressed, and you let me eat all of Gary's... I mean feed Gary for a week.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this has to be extra special, and we should probably vow to it
Patrick: Vow?
SpongeBob: Yeah, vow.
Patrick: Well, how about instead of vowing, we just do it?
SpongeBob: I like it!
[cuts to later that night]
Squidward: [in bed] Good night... lamp. [turns lamp off. Then, sawing and hammering noises begin outside and Squidward turns the lamp back on] I guess having a relaxing evening meant saying up all night with power tools! Well, it's not that late, even morons need to sleep sometime.
[clock spins around until morning and construction sounds are still there]
Squidward: I can't take it anymore!
[runs downstairs grumbling]
Squidward: When I get those two, I am gonna...! [opens door] All right, you two, I... [gasps. he walks out his door to a Hawaiian-like beach with tikis, palms, and waterfalls]
Squidward: It's, it's, it's... beautiful! [gazes in amazement] It's too good to be true! [sadly] It's a mirage! I knew it! [starts walking back to his house] I guess this is it. [Gary walks by with a coconut and Squidward grabs it] Insanity.
[SpongeBob slingshots a Hawaiian shirt on him. Patrick uses a fishing pole to reel down a hat, sunglasses, and a lei and drapes it around Squidward's head.]
Squidward: [sadly] Next stop, padded room at the cephalopod home! [weeps, then looks at his drink and sighs] Just go with it, Squiddy.
[Squidward walks around a bit, drinking his coconut along the way, then comes to a waterfall, goes inside, and takes a shower. then he comes back out to see a tiki boat waiting for him. he gets in and floats down a stream, drinking the coconut. then he realizes it is empty and notices a tiki bar ahead and stops]
Squidward; A refill, my good man! What the? [notices Patrick behind the bar blending a smoothie] Patrick?! what are you doing here?!
[Patrick turns around and pours the drink into Squidward's coconut. While he takes out a newspaper and reads it, Squidward drinks the drink.]
Squidward: It's delicious! What is it?
Patrick: A smoothie.
Squidward: Remember, Squiddy, just go with it.
[tiki song starts as three tikis watch Squidward in the boat]
Tiki #1: Hey fellas, look! it's Squidward!
Tiki #2: Hey, buddy, where ya been?!
Squidward: Hit it boys!
Tikis: Welcome, to Squidward's Tiki Land! Welcome, to Squidward's Tiki Land! You can relax all day like a tiki can, or lay out in the sun for a tiki tan.
Squidward: Or drink from a coconut that's full of flan! [drinks from the coconut]
Tikis: Here in Squidward's Tiki Land! You can play all day in a tiki band, and dance all night on the tiki strand.
Squidward: Don't matter to me 'cause, 'cause I'm crazy, man!
Tikis: Here in Squidward's Tiki Land! [song continues as Squidward floats down the stream]
Squidward: Ahhhh, this is the life!
[Boat bumps onto land where SpongeBob puts out a canvas and paint. Squidward then paints a picture of the wonderful scenery]
SpongeBob: It's beauuuuuuuuuutiful!
[SpongeBob hands Squidward his clarinet and he starts playing]
Squidward: I've never felt this happy in my life! [laughs and grabs SpongeBob and Patrick by the hands and they start dancing in circles. They are laughing and having a good time until Patrick crashes into one of the tikis and knocks them all over in a domino-like effect. The world catches on fire and burns] My world!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are left looking at a charred pile of rubble]
Patrick: You were right, SpongeBob. We should've used glue instead of earwax.
SpongeBob: Yeah, especially considering neither of us have ears.
[Squidward drops to his knees, sweating and completely saddened.]
Squidward: [crying] You-you destroyed my beautiful world!
SpongeBob: Sorry we couldn't make it last forever, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah, we really tried to make it last.
Squidward: [sobbing] Yeah, [sniffles] make it last. [bawls uncontrollably]
[After Squidward finishes crying, he, SpongeBob and Patrick see the tiki boat still in one piece.]
Squidward: I know how to make it last!
[Squidward has attached the boat to a swing and has SpongeBob and Patrick stand and take turns getting hit by it. Patrick gets hit and screams.]
Squidward: [laughs nastily]
[SpongeBob appears, gets hit and screams, and the episode ends with Patrick and SpongeBob getting hit by the boat and screaming with Squidward laughing.]


Narrator: Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties. [lights go off and sirens and red lights blare as everyone in the Krusty Krab screams and runs for cover] Huh?! What's this? [doors and windows are now metal]
Mr. Krabs: Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: [up in a crows nest with a telescope] Down there, sir! [a Krabby Patty is bouncing to the door]
Narrator: [gasps] There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress! [Krabby Patty shoots a laser hole big enough for it to go through at the door] There can only be one culprit: Plankton!
Plankton: Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win! [laughs]
Squidward: He got away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: [devastated] No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!
Narrator: Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's... [SpongeBob tears himself into another SpongeBob and flies off] ...SpongeBob SquarePants! [later, SpongeBob peeks out through under the sewer with binoculars in his hand. Catches a peek at a Krabby Patty jumping through the crowd]
SpongeBob: A-ha! [chases it behind some buildings] Hey! [Plankton flies up with a propeller. SpongeBob takes the twirling club that the cop is using as a propeller and flies after the Krabby Patty to the top of a building] Okay, that's far enough! Huh? [patty jumps off building] Tartar sauce! [uses his hat as a balloon-like ball and jumps off the building. Bounces off the ground towards the Krabby Patty. Bounces past a cowboy and a cowgirl]
Cowboy: Yeehaw! [Plankton walks into a magic shop and comes back out with funny glasses on]
SpongeBob: Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and... [looks up and reads the sign MAGIC SHOP] Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, "If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true." [Plankton takes away Krabby Patty]
Plankton: Argh! I can't take it!
SpongeBob: Plankton! It's you!
Plankton: Yes! And after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser. [cries]
SpongeBob: Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
Plankton: [stops crying] Wh-what did you say?
SpongeBob: I said, you're a-- [a bunch of people run up and point at Plankton]
All: Loser! [Plankton jumps away from group and walks back to his restaurant]
Squidward: How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!
Policeman: Yeah, and for running you out, we're going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day. [puts a big donut with a ribbon on it around SpongeBob]
Squidward, Mr. Krabs, the policeman, Fred, Tammy, Joe, Millie, Ricardo, and Stella: ♪For he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie...♪
[Everyone throws SpongeBob into the air.]
SpongeBob: [thinking to himself] I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.
All: [as SpongeBob comes down, they stop singing] Which no... whatever. [everyone walks away. Later, Plankton hears a knock on his door at his restaurant]
Plankton: A customer? [opens door] Our special today is chum... [sees SpongeBob at the door] ...balaya.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?
SpongeBob: No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Play with me.
Plankton: You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?
SpongeBob: No, but I like to go jelly... [Plankton closes the door]
Plankton: That naïve cube! How long must I suffer this?
Karen: You're not letting him leave, are you? Can't you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!
Plankton: Elaborate. [computer shows images of a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob]
Karen: Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Take the Krabby Patty? [runs back to the door]
Karen: Get moving, genius, don't let him get away.
SpongeBob: [Plankton opens the door]  ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.
Plankton: Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.
SpongeBob: Great! [SpongeBob grabs Plankton and runs off] Last one to the fields is a rotten clam! [now at Jellyfish Fields] So, I get the big net and you get the little net. [hands Plankton a net bigger than him]
Plankton: What happens after we eat 'em?
SpongeBob: You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this! [captures a jellyfish] Like that.
Plankton: And?
SpongeBob: And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!
Plankton: Stingers? [Plankton imagines ruling Bikini Bottom with a jellyfish that only he controls] All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win! [end of fantasy while laughing]
SpongeBob: It's not about winning, it's about fun!
Plankton: What's that?
SpongeBob: Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...
SpongeBob: What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪
Clams: ♪Down here in the deep blue sea.♪
Plankton: ♪F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-♪
SpongeBob: Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪
Plankton: Never! That's completely idiotic!
SpongeBob: Here, let me help you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.♪ Try it!
Plankton: ♪N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪
Clams: ♪Down here in the deep blue sea!♪
Plankton: Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?
SpongeBob: No! That's how you're suppose to feel!
Plankton: Well, I like it. Let's do it again!
SpongeBob: Okay!
SpongeBob and Plankton: ♪F is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, chewing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha!♪
[At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is looking through a telescope at SpongeBob and Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, mutiny.
[At the Chum Bucket at night, Plankton is changing clothes.]
Plankton: And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...
Karen: Sounds like fun.
Plankton: Well, the really fun part was when we...
Karen: What did you do with the Krabby Patty?
Plankton: The what? [shows a Krabby Patty on Karen's computer screen]
Karen: The Krabby Patty, remember?
Plankton: You can't rush these things, you know.
Karen: You're forgetting about the mission! [shows a formula]
Plankton: What are you talking about?
Karen: You're going native, Plankton! Look at yourself! [metal arm picks up Plankton and shows him wearing square pants like SpongeBob's]
Plankton: What?
[cuts to Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.
SpongeBob: Who knows? Maybe he's changed.
Mr. Krabs: Who knows? I think you knows! [shows a picture of him and Plankton holding up the letters for FUN]
SpongeBob: He's changed, I tell you! [Plankton enters]
Plankton: SpongeBuddy! Yoo-hoo! [SpongeBob runs over to Plankton]
SpongeBob: Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private. [talking to Plankton] You won't mind if I set this here, will you? [puts a plate with a Krabby Patty on the table and pushes it toward him]
SpongeBob: What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...
SpongeBob: Why can't you just accept our friendship?
Mr. Krabs: He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you. [walks up to Plankton] Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.
Plankton: Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... suit yourself. [walks off then comes back to push the plate closer to Plankton. Uses a fan to get the smell to Plankton]
SpongeBob: We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs! [turns the fan off] Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here. [both walk away]
Mr. Krabs: Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight. [plate falls down revealing that it was cardboard] And maybe scallops will fly out of my pants! [takes the boat and paddles to the movies] Hang on there, laddie, I'm a-comin! [at the movies, SpongeBob and Plankton are sitting in the front row. SpongeBob is giving popcorn to Plankton as he is eating some himself. Then Bubble Bass comes down and sits on Plankton, squishing him]
SpongeBob: I sure like sequels, Plankton. [sees Bubble Bass in his spot] Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend. [Bubble Bass meanly smiles and gets comfortable in his seat, and a squelching sound comes from Plankton being squashed by his butt] Hey, Bubble Bass! [throws some popcorn and Bubble Bass runs after it]
Plankton: Thanks for that, friend.
SpongeBob: Sure thing.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up! [Mr. Krabs' shadow is on the movie screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? [in the projector room]
Mr. Krabs: He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got! [the ladies didn't understand, so they reach in their husbands pockets and take out a watch, some money and a piggy bank then run off] You too, boy! [SpongeBob reaches into Plankton's pocket and takes out a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I can't believe this!
Plankton: It's not what you think.
SpongeBob: What is it then? Tell me what you see here!
Plankton: I... I don't see anything.
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] How can you not see it!? [groans]
Plankton: [beginning to tear up as well] Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay? I couldn't help it.
SpongeBob: But we sang The F.U.N. Song! [clutches his stomach] I think I'm gonna be sick. How long?
Plankton: How long what?
SpongeBob: [grabs Plankton, holding him in his fist] How long were you planning on doing this?! [tears well up in SpongeBob's eyes] Tell me!
[Plankton puts his head down and begins to sob.]
SpongeBob: [the tears now dripping down his face] What?!
Plankton: [looks up at SpongeBob] All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship! [the two look each other in the eyes] And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!
SpongeBob: [sniffs, then smiles, beginning to stop crying] Really?
Plankton: [Plankton grabs the patty and jumps towards the screen] No, not really. Being evil is too much fun! [laughs evilly]
Movie Woman: Oh, darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart. [Plankton rips through the movie screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.
Mr Krabs: Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what’s behind these screens? Solid concrete! [laughs. Plankton is squished on the wall groaning. Mr. Krabs takes the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.
Mr. Krabs: Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Well, maybe on a discount. [Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the wall and onto Bubble Bass' jelly beans]
Plankton: Huh? [Plankton runs around Bubble Bass' hand getting chased by his other hand, being mistaken for a jelly bean]


[episode begins at Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Thanks for having lunch with me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Anything for my bestest buddy. There's no better way I could've spent my lunch break. [slurps his drink and makes a relaxed face] Ahh.
Patrick: That's a pretty cool face. [chuckles] Check you this one out. [chomps, chews]
SpongeBob: [laughs] I love it. What do you think of this? Awoo! [laughs]
Patrick: Oh, hey, how about this? [dolphin call]
SpongeBob: That's awesome! [SpongeBob and Patrick both laugh]
Mr. Krabs: [snores] Ooh. I know that sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet! [SpongeBob and Patrick laughs] SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?
SpongeBob: Sorry, sir. I got carried away. Patrick and I were making faces at each other.
Patrick: Funny faces make me laugh! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What?! Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?
SpongeBob: Why, is there something wrong?
Mr. Krabs: Haven't ye ever heard the saying "If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way"?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uh, no!
Mr. Krabs: Let me tell you the story of face freeze. [thunder claps, SpongeBob and Patrick's tooth chattering, breathing quickly] It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out. [Fred raspberries and laughs] But what he really liked, was sticking his tongue at people. [Fred raspberries and laughs, Norma and green Monroe gasp]
Norma Rechid: How rude! [Monroe cries]
[Fred raspberries]
Mr. Krabs: Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time, [Fred raspberries] his face froze with his tongue sticking out...
Fred: Huh, huh... Huh?
Mr. Krabs: ...permanently!
Mable: Weirdo.
Fred: [muffled] No... no!
Mr. Krabs: He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, no!
Mr. Krabs: So are you gonna keep making faces, boys?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mm-mm.
Mr. Krabs: Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.
SpongeBob: I'm glad Mr. Krabs caught us before it was too late. Let's agree never to make faces again.
Patrick: Done and done.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Don't even smile. That's considered making a face.
Patrick: Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.
SpongeBob: Yeah. This is... [gulps] easy. How you holding up?
Patrick: Huh, fine. You?
[SpongeBob grunts, but makes an T-shaped face and laughs]
Patrick: [laughs] Dun ah eeh.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are both laughing, until SpongeBob stops and looks at his himself]
SpongeBob: Hey! [Patrick is still ignoring him while laughing] Patrick. [pulls out a megaphone] Patrick!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: Look at us. We're okay. Our faces didn't freeze.
[Patrick stretching]
Patrick: Gosh, you're right.
SpongeBob: Guess, Mr. Krabs made a mistake. Well, now that we know his tall tale isn't true, let's make lots of faces.
Patrick: You mean like this? [stretching] Ree eeh eeh!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both, SpongeBob growls]
Patrick: [laughs] Aye yi yi yi!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Aw!
[montage of SpongeBob and Patrick making grotesque faces]
Patrick: Phee!
SpongeBob: Ay yi yi yi yi yi!
Patrick: Dun ree ah yee!
SpongeBob: Doy doy doy doy!
Patrick: Ah ah ooh!
SpongeBob: Duh!
Patrick: Aydh!
SpongeBob: Awoot duh doo!
Patrick: Looo ooo ooo!
SpongeBob: Day ah dah da dah!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both]
SpongeBob: I can't breathe! [SpongeBob grabs a mirror and they look into it] Well, still no frozen faces. Let's really put this myth to the test. Let's see what happens when me hold one face for a long time.
Patrick: Yes! But, how to choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross, [Makes his eyes go up to the top of his head] uh? And then slip into an overbite. [Pulling out upper jaw] And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Delightfully wicked, my friend. I call this one... [He pushed his nose, makes his mouth bigger and puts out his eyeballs on the top of his head] The Gary. Meow!
Patrick: [chuckles] Gloriously disgusting, sir.
SpongeBob: Let's not keep these grotesque faces to ourselves. Let us share them with the whole wide sea. [SpongeBob and Patrick laughing both]
[scene cuts]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
[SpongeBob and Patrick come out of the ocean]
[Everybody swims away screaming]
Sandy: [paddling up on a surfboard] You two need help.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing again]
[scene bubble transitions into night]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
[Patrick turns on the flashlight.]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
[Patrick turns off flashlight]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
[Patrick turns on flashlight]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
[Patrick turns off flashlight]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
[Patrick turns on flashlight]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
SpongeBob: It never gets so old!
[Patrick turns off flashlight]
[Squidward rips the tent]
Squidward: Do you mind?!
SpongeBob: Mind what? Making faces? Of course were don't.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laughing]
Patrick: You got that right, pal! What a silly question.
SpongeBob: Your turn, Squidward, let's see your crazy face.
Squidward: I don't wanna make faces. I want to sleep! D-de-de-de-Da!
SpongeBob: That's a good one right there.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: Oh, good one, Squidward!
Squidward: Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!
SpongeBob: Interesting challenge, but let's raise the stakes even higher. Patrick, I'll bet you can't keep that face all night, while you sleep!
Patrick: Oh yeah? Watch me.
[They both sleep]
Squidward: Whatever works.
[Later, the sun rises]
SpongeBob: [Surprised] Wow, Patrick, you did hold that face all night!
Patrick: Actually, I can't move my face at all. [He feels on his face]
SpongeBob: I can't move my face either!
Patrick: [oblivious and excited] All right! We did it!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! It's not all right, this means Mr. Krabs was right! [Patrick then realizes the situation and gets scared.] Patrick, we have the face freeze!
[Both scream]
SpongeBob: Patrick, Sandy was right, we need help!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sandy! Sandy!
[Later at Sandy's treedome]
Sandy: Hmm, this may get tricky. Y'all need to relax them facial muscles, what y'all need is a massage.
SpongeBob: And you're a licensed masseuse, right, Sandy?
Sandy: Well, I shouldn't say licensed. Just sit back, relax, and let my gentle mammalian hands melt away that tension. [shows Sandy's hands looking creepy] You seem to be carrying a lot of stress in your eyeballs. Them shoulders look way outta line. I can feel them knots just meltin' away. Let's see if I can just finesse that jaw line back in place. [Later, Sandy is done] Phew! Okay, you two. Bad news first. That wicked face freeze ain't going nowhere. But, y'all are looking much more relaxed.
[showing that SpongeBob's and Patrick's faces are more deformed]
Mr. Krabs: [At the Krusty Krab] Ahoy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hello, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob walks with his back towards him to the kitchen and Mr. Krabs goes in as well]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, you all right, boy? Eh, look a little cattywampus walking in here.
SpongeBob: Doing fine, Mr. Krabs. Just grillin' and grillin'...
Mr. Krabs: Ahem. Uh, but what's with the skewed posture?
[He touches SpongeBob's head and SpongeBob knocks his claw away]
SpongeBob: Oh, did you hear that? Someone somewhere just dropped a penny.
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] Penny? Where?! Where?! [Looks for a penny]
SpongeBob: That'll buy me some time.
Squidward: Let's go, SpongeBob, the orders are piling up.
SpongeBob: I'm on it, Squidward! [starts slicing an onion, but onion juice gets in his eyes] Onion juice! Ah!
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob! Chop, chop!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay. [Falls, retrieves patties on back] Ow! Phew. Order up.
Squidward: You deliver it, I'm on break.
Mr. Krabs: Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny. [sniffs] Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is still distracted. Now's my chance. [passes Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny, penny...
SpongeBob: Your order is served, sir.
Harold: [Gasps when he sees that SpongeBob's lips are drooling on the patties] I'm sorry, I did not order a side of lips with my patty!
SpongeBob: Oh, dear.
Harold: [Takes money out of register] I'm taking my clams elsewhere.
[As SpongeBob tiptoes behind Mr. Krabs on the way back to the kitchen, Krabs takes notice of Harold leaving and chases him to the door]
Mr. Krabs: Wait, come back!
SpongeBob: Why, oh, why, why did I have to make a face? [whimpers]
Mr. Krabs: What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?
SpongeBob: Um, how should I know? I'm just the cook in these parts.
Mr. Krabs: Face me when I'm talking to you, boy-o. [SpongeBob turns around with his face down] So I can see your face.
SpongeBob: Hey, have you seen this, Mr. Krabs? [shows him a rolling trick] My impersonation of a burrito!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... huh? [Sees Patrick walk in with face freeze]
Patrick: [Sees Mr. Krabs and gets worried] Oh. Is this a bad time, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I see what's going on here. [Picks up SpongeBob and turns to see his frozen face.] Aha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?
SpongeBob: [Guilty] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. We thought it was just one of your stories.
Mr. Krabs: I'm losing business because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ah! [Mr. Krabs' anger gives himself the face freeze] No! I can't move me face. I've got the face freeze, too!
Squidward: What is the hold up in here—?
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward, don't get worked up! you could get the face freeze!
Squidward: Face freeze? I thought that was a myth? Ha! Krabs too! [begins laughing hard] This is rich! Ha ha ha! Oh. [sees Patrick, begins laughing very hard and he too gets face freeze] Hey, my face! Ah, my face. Oh, great, look at what you've done. [begins crying]
Mr. Krabs: Look! Squidward has it, too!
[All three begin laughing while Squidward keeps crying]
Squidward: Hey, it's not funny! Stop laughing!


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is outside in his boat on the street, waiting for SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [growls impatiently and honks his horn] SpongeBob! [growls and honks his horn again] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [appears on the passenger seat with a pilot helmet on] Oh, boy! Road trip! [fastens his seatbelt] I hope it lasts forever.
[Mr. Krabs drives up to Old Man Jenkins' farm, which is only ten feet away from the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: And we're here.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs head for the barn's entrance.]
SpongeBob: Old Man Jenkins' farm?
[The scarecrow starts to shake and Old Man Jenkins' appears from the shirt's opening.]
Old Man Jenkins: Trespassers!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs scream. Mr. Krabs hides in his shell and SpongeBob hides behind him. SpongeBob peaks his eyes out over Mr. Krabs' eyestalk holes. Old Man Jenkins comes out from scarecrow costume and points his pitchfork at Mr. Krabs' face.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa there, Jenkins! [Old Man Jenkins points his pitchfork further, but Mr. Krabs pushes it back] Pull in your plow! I'm here to pay me grocery bill. [holds up his really long bill] Jenkins here supplies all the Krusty Krab's farm fresh ingredients.
SpongeBob: [as Mr. Krabs' bill extends itself] Ooh. [laughs] Yoo-hoo! Whee! [slides on the bill]
Old Man Jenkins: And I expect to be paid for them.
Mr. Krabs: Well, funny you should mention that. [SpongeBob comes up next to Old Man Jenkins in a farmer lady's outfit] SpongeBob here will be your farm hand until me bill's paid off.
SpongeBob: Farm hand! Oh, boy! [rips off his outfit]
Old Man Jenkins: Dagnabbit! If you think you can—[gets cut off by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, look at the time. Gotta go! Hey, boy-o! [hops into his boat] This should help you with your work! [throws out a sack and drives away]
[The sack hits SpongeBob in the face and it skids him across the ground.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Potatoes?
[The sack opens and reveals Patrick eating all the potatoes.]
Patrick: Pat-tatoes! [shows his mouth full of potatoes]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! We can be farming buddies. [hugs Patrick really tight, which makes him spit out the potatoes]
Old Man Jenkins: Now hold on there, youngin'. I can't just let any dern fools work on my farm.
SpongeBob: Oh, we're not just any dern fools.
[SpongeBob and Patrick dig into their mouths and pull out their certified fools badges.]
Patrick: We're certified fools.
Old Man Jenkins: Hm….Well, better hitch up your britches. 'Cause we got tons of chores to get done before the big barn dance tonight!
[Old Man Jenkins' farm and grain silo laugh and dance around. The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins leading SpongeBob and Patrick to the oyster coop.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. What's first?
Old Man Jenkins: First thing we do is gatherin' pearly eggs from this oyster coop here. The trick is getting them oysters to open up their clams. [rubs gently on the oyster's chin] Coochie coochie coo.
[The oyster laughs and spits out an egg. Old Man Jenkins takes the egg and shows it to SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, shiny.
Patrick: Ooh, aww.
Old Man Jenkins: [puts egg in basket] I'll be back in two shakes of a lamprey's tail to see how you're coming along.
[SpongeBob leans in to do the same trick as Old Man Jenkins did.]
SpongeBob: [rubs gently on the oyster's chin] Uh, coochie coo-coochie…
Oyster: [pouts] Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Okay, that didn't work.
Patrick: SpongeBob, you gotta be more gentle.
[Patrick grabs a crowbar and screams like a crazy maniac. He jumps over and sticks the crowbar in the oyster's mouth. Patrick tries to pry the oyster's mouth open with all his might, but the oyster flips Patrick over.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
[Patrick whirls around in the air and lands on SpongeBob's face. The crowbar lands in Patrick's mouth and falls flat on the ground. SpongeBob's face is flattened and shaped like Patrick's buttocks before popping itself back in shape. The oysters laugh and spit eggs at SpongeBob and Patrick. Old Man Jenkins comes back and sees the basket still empty.]
Old Man Jenkins: Why, you ain't gathered up a single egg!
[SpongeBob comes over with his mouthful of eggs and spits them in the basket.]
SpongeBob: Well, that was egg-citing. [laughs]
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob, and Patrick at the worm hog pen filled with worm hogs.]
Old Man Jenkins: The next chore is to feed the worm hogs.
[SpongeBob pours a bucket full of slop into the worm hog pen and rings the bell with his nose. The worm hogs run up and begin eating their food. Patrick is also eating the food with the worm hogs.]
Patrick: [swallows the slop] Mmm. Slop.
[One little worm hog is trying to eat some of the food and frantically looks for a place to dig in. But Patrick kicks the little worm hog away.]
SpongeBob: Aww. Are you hingry-wungry cutie-wuite hoggy-woggy? [feeds some slop to the little worm hog and laughs] That tickles. [gasps as the little worm hog begins to swallow him whole]
[SpongeBob screams frantically to break free, but the little worm hog spits SpongeBob out and completely swallows him up before belching out his clothes.]
SpongeBob: Uh, could somebody hand me those?
[Old Man Jenkins sighs in disgust. The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob and Patrick with a cow-like jellyfish in the farm.]
Old Man Jenkins: Now, you be gentle when you milk ol' Bessie. [leaves as Bessie moos]
SpongeBob: Don't you worry. I'll take it easy peasy on the old jelly squeezy.
[SpongeBob grabs a bucket, pulls up a stool and attempts to milk jellyfish jelly from Bessie's udder. He grabs it and goes to milk it, but the udder sprays jelly on the floor. SpongeBob tries desperately to figure out how to milk it, but the udder keeps spraying jelly all over the place. SpongeBob, had enough with the udder, grabs it and goes to milk the jelly in the bucket. But the udder builds up so much jelly, that it causes Bessie to get angry and sprays jelly all around.]
Old Man Jenkins: What in tarnation—[gets sprayed by Bessie's jelly]
[Bessie gets really angry and throws a fit by kicking everything. She then kicks SpongeBob and Patrick and sends them flying towards Old Man Jenkins. All three of them crash into the farm's front door.]
Patrick: Mmm, a Jenkin Jelly sandwich! [licks jelly off of Old Man Jenkins]
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins giving SpongeBob and Patrick their final chore outside the farm. Patrick eats some of Bessie's jelly while Old Man Jenkins is talking.]
Old Man Jenkins: Your final chore is harvesting my kelp patch.
SpongeBob: [sees a tiny patch of kelp] Ha, this will be a snap.
Old Man Jenkins: Not that patch. That one! [points to really huge field full of kelp]
SpongeBob: [groans] That'll take forever!
Old Man Jenkins: Not if you use my tractor. [points to his tractor]
SpongeBob: But I don't have a tractor license.
Patrick: I got lots of licenses. [shows off his licenses] Driver's license, fishing license, marriage license. Oh, here it is! Tractor license!
[Patrick drives the tractor through the kelp patch. The tractor makes several bails of kelp from the back.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick. You're really good at this.
Patrick: The secret is to stay cool as a sea cucumber. I don't want anything to distract—[shouts as he sees a jellybee flying over him] A bee! [screams] Jellybee! [babbles as he tries to shoo it away, but since there is no one steering the wheel, the tractor begins driving around uncontrollably] Get it off, get it off, get it off!
[The tractor trips over a rock and flips around. The jellybee is now sitting on the tractor's steering wheel.]
SpongeBob: Hold on, buddy. [grabs a rope from under the seat] I got it. [throws the rope] Hyah! [misses as it catches the steering wheel] Whoops. [the jellybee flies into SpongeBob's nose, but SpongeBob holds it closed so it won't fly out] Got it.
Patrick: Yay! Don't let it go. [stupidly throws SpongeBob out]
[SpongeBob lands on the ground and gets dragged around by the tractor.]
SpongeBob: [spits out sand] Hey, this is fun.
[The tractor continues to drive while making some kelp bails. SpongeBob skids across the field and dodges the kelp bails.]
SpongeBob: [laughs while dodging the kelp bails] Whoo-hoo!
[The jellybee flies out from one of SpongeBob's holes and stings him from behind. SpongeBob screams in pain and flips over to the front of the tractor in slow-motion. SpongeBob gets caught in the tractor's grinders and comes out all tied up.]
SpongeBob: Did I "bail" out too soon? [laughs and breaks free] Oh, boy! Our chores are all done. It's time for the...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Barn dance!
[The tractor drives into Old Man Jenkins' farm and destroys it.]
Old Man Jenkins: How can I have a barn dance with no barn? [sobs]
SpongeBob: Don't you worry your little wrinkly head. 'Cause we're gonna have an old fashioned barn raising.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob holding a barn baby as he rocks it. Patrick fills a baby bottle with nails and gives it to SpongeBob. SpongeBob feeds the barn baby the bottle of nails.]
Patrick: Aww, wee, wee, wee. [gently rubs the barn baby's chin] Coochie coochie coo.
[The barn baby belches out nails. SpongeBob and Patrick are now covered in nails, but it didn't hurt them.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aww.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob reading a book to the barn kid while Patrick paints red paint on its siding.]
SpongeBob: [reading] "'A' is for Amoeba. 'B' is for Blobfish."
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick and the barn kid playing catch. The barn kid throws the ball at SpongeBob. SpongeBob throws it to Patrick. Patrick throws it back to the barn kid, but it misses as it crashes into the window of Old Man Jenkins' house.]
Old Man Jenkins' house: Oh! You dang kids!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins standing in front of a newly made farm.]
SpongeBob: Congratulations on your barn-mitzvah. Today you are a man-barn.
Patrick: Mazel tov!
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] Aw, they grow up so fast. [blows his nose]
[The scene changes to nighttime. Old Man Jenkins' new farm is ready for the barn dance. SpongeBob turns on the flashlight and sticks it onto Bessie. Bessie moos happily and floats up to the ceiling. She then starts to spin around like a disco ball.]
SpongeBob: Perfect! [Patrick is eating a bucket of worm hog slop] Hey, Patrick. You know what time it is?
Patrick: [pulls his head out of the bucket] Time to put on my ham boots? [points to his feet standing on two hams]
[One worm hog squeals and runs away.]
SpongeBob: Nope! It's time to...[opens the front door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Partay! [sees no one there] Hmm?
[The wind blows and a tumbleweed rolls by.]
Patrick: Where is everybody?
SpongeBob: When are your other guests coming, Old Man Jenkins?
Old Man Jenkins: [spraying jelly out from Bessie's udder] Hmm? [wipes the jelly off his beard] What do you mean? This is the biggest turnout I've ever had!
[Suddenly, the ground starts to shake. Outside the farm, a UFO comes flying over and looms downward. The hatch opens and the tractor beam shines down. An object comes out from the UFO, which turns out to be some kind of strange outhouse. The door opens and green smoke fumes. Then, a strange alien appears within the smoke.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I think the party's over.
[The alien looked like is was going to attack SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins. But as the smoke clears, the alien looks almost like a hill-billy farmer.]
Farmer alien: Over? Why, it's just getting started. [pulls out a fiddle and plays music]
[Then some more hill-billy farmer aliens come out and play their instruments. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins join in the fun and dance around with the farmer aliens. The tractor continues driving around the kelp patch as everyone dances.]
SpongeBob: How did you guys know about the barn dance?
Farmer alien: Well, we seen your invitation.
SpongeBob: Invitation? What invitation?
[The farmer alien activates his fiddle and a green glow surrounds it. SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins and the farmer alien are also surrounded in a green glow.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? Wow.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float upward where they can see the view of the farm.]
Farmer alien: "Barn dance and hoedown tonight. Aliens welcome." [points down to the strange pattern in the kelp patch created by the tractor]
SpongeBob: Patrick, your crazy tractor driving invited them!
Patrick: [shows off his crop circle license] I have a crop circle license too.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Old Man Jenkins, and the farmer alien float back down to the ground.]
Farmer alien: Thank you kindly for inviting us, old timer. Well, we're off to destroy the universe. [pulls out a ray gun]
Other farmer aliens: Yee-haw! [shoot their ray guns before heading back into their outhouse]
Old Man Jenkins: [chuckles] Y'all come back and invade any time.
SpongeBob: Annihilate safely.
[The farmer aliens close their outhouse door and the UFO's tractor beam floats them back into their ship before flying away.]
Farmer aliens: [as their UFO flies away] Yee-haw!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Old Man Jenkins wave good-bye to the farmer aliens just as Mr. Krabs pulls up in his boat.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey-ho, Jenkins! Has SpongeBob worked off me bill yet?
Old Man Jenkins: [rips the bill in pieces] You're all paid off, Krabs. [rubs SpongeBob's head] Now come back and visit anytime, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bye, Old Man Jenkins!
[SpongeBob and Patrick hop into Mr. Krabs' boat and they drive away from Old Man Jenkins' farm. SpongeBob is telling Mr. Krabs what they did while Patrick sleeps.]
SpongeBob: Then we gathered pearly eggs, fed the worm hogs, milked Bessie, and then we met some nice space aliens.
Mr. Krabs: Aliens? That's ridiculous. I think you've been working too hard, boy-o. Looks like you got farm stroke. You must have been hallucinating. There ain't no such thing as UFOs.
SpongeBob: Gee, you think we just imagined it?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, probably—[screams as a tractor beam suddenly shines over them, shocked he was wrong] A UFO!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, there is no such thing as aliens.
[The tractor beam lifts the boat and abducts SpongeBob, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs. Then the UFO turns and flies away into the sky as the tractor drives by the Krusty Krab.]


[Open on the Krusty Krab. The customers are eating food, Mr. Krabs is painting a picture and Squidward is manning the cash register.]
Mr. Krabs: Finished! At last. [Shows the picture to Squidward and SpongeBob, who is now at the chef's window] What do you boys think of my masterpiece?
SpongeBob: [reading the sign] New business hours: 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Squidward: What?! That is totally unfair!
SpongeBob: Squidward's right. That's totally unfair! Couldn't we get to work earlier than 6:00 a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or-- [Squidward zips up the chef's window]
Squidward: Zip it! [Mr. Krabs places the sign on the front window. He stares out of the window and notices something surprising from across the street]
Mr. Krabs: What the...?! [The Chum Bucket now displays a sign in front saying that it is "now open 23 hours"] The Chum Bucket open 23 hours?! So, that little piece of flotsam Plankton thinks he can stay open longer than me, does he? [A customer walks up to him, tray in hand]
Fish: Sure. I don't know. Why not?
Mr. Krabs: Well, he's wrong!
Fish: Oh, okay. Sure.
Mr. Krabs: As of now, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours! [SpongeBob's head bursts through the wall, in the place where the chef's window used to be]
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Squidward? We get to keep working and working and working without ever having to go home! I've got to pinch myself, because I must be dreaming. [SpongeBob exits the punctured hole in the wall and stands flat on the floor. He starts pinching himself twice, then yells in pain. He pinches himself again and yells again, then does it four more times. After a brief pause, he pinches himself yet again] Well, I'm not dreaming. [Switch to a telescope view of the front window of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs walks up to the sign and amends it to read, Open 24 hours!]
Plankton: [behind the telescope] Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me. [He starts walking into the Chum Bucket] My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula! [Laughs evilly. He notices after a while that his computer wife, Karen is not laughing with him] Why aren't you laughing?
Karen: I've heard this joke before. [Scene switches to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is standing near the cash register with a cowbell and beater in his hands]
Mr. Krabs: All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3! [The camera shows the customers of the Krusty Krab eating their food and not being swayed by Mr. Krabs' excitement] Yee haw! Day 3!
SpongeBob: [inside the kitchen, holding a Krabby patty] Krabby Patty, I don't care if we have to stay open until the day after the end of time. As long as I am with you, I am complete. [Bubbles fill the screen as the episode transitions to the outside of the Krusty Krab. It then cuts to the inside, where Mr. Krabs still is holding the cowbell]
Mr. Krabs: Day 10 of non-stop service!
Squidward: [exhausted] Mr. Krabs, can I go home yet?
Mr. Krabs: No one goes home!
Squidward: [points to the bags under his eyes] Look at these bags under my eyes; even my bags have bags! [The camera shows a closely detailed picture of Squidward's drowsy eyes, and a lady screams.]
Mr. Krabs: Quit your bellyaching, Squidward; you don't hear SpongeBob complaining, do you?
SpongeBob: [grilling hamburgers in the kitchen] ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y, says I.♪
Mr. Krabs: You could learn a few things from that boy.
Squidward: [through his teeth] Mr. Krabs, he is not normal. [SpongeBob starts kissing a Krabby Patty]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you can sit down for five minutes. Then it's back to work. [Squidward drops over and starts snoring. Plankton, wearing a tight black suit, descends from a rope on the wall and monitors at SpongeBob]
Plankton: Drats! He's not collapsing from exhaustion! But with a little more pressure, the sponge will crack like an egg [clenches fist], and I'll be there to feast on the goo of his shattered psyche. [Slurps and then does an evil laugh. Mr. Krabs notices Plankton, but since he is tiny, black and suspending from a coil, he believes Plankton is a small insect]
Mr. Krabs: Eww! A spider bug. [Mr. Krabs squishes him and the scene changes to the Chum Bucket a while later. Plankton is on the phone, ordering an item from the Krusty Krab]
Plankton: Come on! [Mr. Krabs finally picks up on the other line]
Mr. Krabs: Krusty Krab! The restaurant that never closes. Would you like to place an order? [We hear a muffled sound from Mr. Krabs' phone] 10,000 Krabby Patties?! We'll start your order right away, Mr...uh, uh...What was that name again? [Muffles coming from the phone. Mr. Krabs writes his information on a piece of paper] Uh huh...Peter Lankton. Wait a minute, this isn't some kind of prank, is it?
Plankton: Eh...no.
Mr. Krabs: Good! We'll call you when it's ready, Mr. Lankton. [Mr. Krabs bursts through the kitchen door, and starts yelling orders at SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Kick it into high gear! We've got a big order! [Clutches SpongeBob, who is staring into space] I'm counting on you, boy! I need you to raise that spatular! [SpongeBob does so, enthusiastically] Yeah! And I need you to say, "Team Krusty Krab!"
SpongeBob: Team Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy! Now, make me 10,000 Krabby Patties. [SpongeBob's eyes swell up as Mr. Krabs walks away] And no breaks!
SpongeBob: [Ecstatic, giggles] Did you hear that, spatula? You, me and 10,000 Krabby Patties. And the best part? No breaks! [Pinches himself] Wow! [Cut to a view of the ocean with a small island with some palm trees in the background]
Mr. Krabs: Day 15! Give it up for day 15! [floats by as he hits the bell]
SpongeBob: ♪K-R-A-B-B-Y P-A-T-T-Y...♪ [floats by, flipping three of six patties on the grill, as the setting transforms into the nighttime. Plankton floats by as the setting transforms into the daytime. Plankton laughs menacingly. SpongeBob floats by, putting mustard on one of four unfinished patties]
SpongeBob: 1,322...
Mr. Krabs: Day 23! Give it up for day 23! [floats by as the setting transforms into the nighttime. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue floating by as the setting changes from day to night and vice versa]
SpongeBob: 6,654...
Mr. Krabs: Day 30!
SpongeBob: 7,121... [Plankton floats by now. He laughs menacingly. Patty items float by]
Mr. Krabs: Day...35...! [floating by as the setting transforms into the nighttime. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue floating by as the setting changes from day to night and vice versa]
SpongeBob: 8,659... [floats by]
Old Man Walker: Wait, what's going on? Whoa, whoa! [floats by, confusedly. The scene switches back to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs appears extremely tired]
Mr. Krabs: Day... [record scratch] anyone know how many days it's been? I've lost track.
Squidward: [Breathing heavily next to a pile of Krabby Patties] 43...! [Gasps, as the top of his head expands and shrinks. SpongeBob places a tray of food items on the chef's window and then shoves them off. He does the same again for a smelly boot]
Mr. Krabs: What the flimflam?! [Enters the kitchen and notices SpongeBob looking like a wreck] What are you doing in here, boy? You're wasting all me food. [SpongeBob does not answer him] Boy? [SpongeBob starts fighting the air with his spatula. Mr. Krabs hits him on the back of his head]
SpongeBob: [Drowsily] Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs. When did you get here?
Mr. Krabs: Boy, I'm worried that... [Mr. Krabs turns into a giant talking Krabby Patty] Got it?
SpongeBob: [wiping his eyes] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. Could you run that by me again?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, I said I'm worried that... [He turns into a Krabby Patty again. He turns back into himself after he stops talking]
SpongeBob: That's what I thought you said. Now, let me offer this as a rebuttal: [he starts screaming and throwing his hands in the air. He hides in the corner, waving his spatula at Mr. Krabs] Stay back! I'm warning you!
Mr. Krabs: [Starts walking towards SpongeBob] All right. Now you're just acting silly. I want you to... [Mr. Krabs turns into a Krabby Patty again]
SpongeBob: No, don't eat me! I'm too chewy! [Screams and runs outside the kitchen, where his eyes bulge as he notices the customers are now Krabby Patties] Holy shrimp! They're everywhere! [Runs screaming and knocks into a Krabby Patty, falling]
Krabby Patty: [looking at him] What?
SpongeBob: [Running and screaming. He starts screaming at two Krabby Patties sitting at a table, then one going to the bathroom and then screaming and pointing at Tom.]
Sally: I told you that shirt was hideous. [SpongeBob screams again as Mr. Krabs grabs him and pulls him into the kitchen, while SpongeBob is digging his nails into the floor]
SpongeBob: No, no! I want to live! [He enters the kitchen, but bursts the door open] I want to live [He's dragged back inside. The camera shows Squidward, exhausted]
SpongeBob: [inside the kitchen] Mr. Krabs, what's going on? Everywhere I look, I see killer Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs: [patting SpongeBob's head] There, there. I'm sure it's nothing that getting back to work won't solve. Here's your Spatular. [Hands SpongeBob his spatula]
SpongeBob: [repeating] Spatular.
Mr. Krabs: [showing SpongeBob his grill] and here's the grill.
SpongeBob: [repeating] Grill.
Mr. Krabs: [Showing SpongeBob some patties in his hands] and here are some fresh Krabby... [SpongeBob starts screaming again. When Mr. Krabs pulls the patties away, SpongeBob's scream lessens. He pulls the patties out in front of him and continues pushing and pulling them forward]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, there may be a problem after all.
SpongeBob: What does this mean?
Mr Krabs: It means there's something wrong with your head. Look, I think maybe you should see a professional.
SpongeBob: Wrestler?
Mr. Krabs: No, a psychiatrist.
SpongeBob: Oh, but where am I going to find a psychiatrist? [A paper airplane hits him in the head] Ow! [Plankton is at the chef's window and then drops down. SpongeBob starts reading the paper] Hey, look at this! "Dr. Peter Lankton: Psychiatrist. Specializing in Krabby Patty phobias". Gosh, I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. Wouldn't I have to miss work if I went to see... [Mr. Krabs holds up a patty in front of SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob points and screams at it, then runs off. The scene switches to SpongeBob, paper in his hand, finding out where the psychiatric center is. SpongeBob looks up] Well, this looks like the place. [It is the Chum Bucket with the sign "Dr. P. Lankton Psychiatrist" on it. SpongeBob enters, looking for the psychiatrist] Hello? Doctor?
Plankton: Come in, Mr. SquarePants. Please have a seat on the couch. [SpongeBob sits on the couch. He turns his chair around so that we can see Plankton wearing a costume and beard] Now... [chuckles] Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head.
SpongeBob: You're a bit smaller than I imagined, doctor, but I guess that's why they call you shrink [laughs]. Do you think there's hope for me, doctor?
Plankton: Hope? Hope!? When I get my hands on that formula, there won't be any hope for any of you! [Laughs, but then clears his throat] Yeah, I mean, you'll be cured in no time.
SpongeBob: Oh, good.
Plankton: Let's start with a simple exercise.
SpongeBob: Jumping jacks?
Plankton: I want you to close your eyes. [SpongeBob lightly closes his eyes] Tighter [he closes his eyes tighter] Tighter [Tightens them even more, until the rip off] Too tight! Now, tell me what you see?
SpongeBob: I see giant Krabby Patties!
Plankton: Good, and what are they made of? [He starts recording on a voice recorder]
SpongeBob: Hatred!
Plankton: No, I mean ingredients. What are the stinking ingredients?!
SpongeBob: They're coming for me. No! No! No! Stay back! [He produces a grand piano from nowhere and somehow holds it threateningly in the air]
Plankton: Wait, where'd you get that piano? [SpongeBob smashes Plankton with the piano. He groans. Later, he continues his psychology] We're trying something else. I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head. Ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Plankton: Work.
SpongeBob: Work.
Plankton: Spatula.
SpongeBob: Spatula.
Plankton: Bun.
SpongeBob: Bun.
Plankton: See, the key is to say something different to what I say.
SpongeBob: Oh, okay, I've got it.
Plankton: Potato.
SpongeBob: Potahto.
Plankton: Tomato.
SpongeBob: Tomahto. [Scene switches to SpongeBob kneeling on the floor looking at various cards]
Plankton: I've laid out some words on cards here. These words are common kitchen ingredients. I want you to arrange them in any order you choose. It could be a poem or a secret formula. I don't know… oh, yes! A secret formula. Good, let's do that.
SpongeBob: Um, you're making me nervous.
Plankton: Oh, okay. [Walks to and sits on his chair] I'll be over here, then.
SpongeBob: I'm finished! [Plankton gets up and walks to SpongeBob] I've arranged them into a piano. [The piano falls on Plankton]
Plankton: Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you.
SpongeBob: Fiber?
Plankton: No, hypnosis.
SpongeBob: Hypnosis?!
Plankton: [holds a ticking watch in front of him] Now, keep your eyes on this watch. [shakes it slowly] When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3. [SpongeBob falls asleep and begins snoring very loudly] I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula. [Snaps fingers, but SpongeBob continues snoring loudly. He snaps a couple more times] Hey, wake up! [He clashes cymbals, blows a trumpet and beats on drums, but SpongeBob continues snoring, even louder than the sounds] Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious? [He holds a loud ringing cell phone up to his ear, but SpongeBob's snoring is even louder] Why won't you wake up?!
[We peer into SpongeBob's dream. In it, he is chasing jellyfish, but then gets caught in a fishnet by a huge Krabby Patty, who then eats him. Inside the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob looks around in the dark]
SpongeBob: Where am I? [Lights turn on and he is lying in his bed in his home. The door to his room opens and a huge Krabby Patty walks in]
Krabby Patty: Hey, SpongeBob. I heard your brain was sick, so I brought you this cookie pizza. [Hands SpongeBob a cookie pizza]
SpongeBob: Gee, thanks!
Krabby Patty: And here's some chocolate milk. [Hands SpongeBob a glass of chocolate milk]
SpongeBob: The king of flavored dairy drinks! [He drinks it quickly] Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again.
Krabby Patty: Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you right here [points to a part of SpongeBob's stomach] .
SpongeBob: In my heart?
Krabby Patty: Actually, in your arteries. Now, do me a favor and wake up. Wake up.
Plankton: [In real life, shouting into a loudspeaker] Wake up!
SpongeBob: [wakes up, yawning] It worked! I'm cured!
Plankton: But what about the formula?
SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work! [SpongeBob runs away, towards the Krusty Krab] Thanks for everything, doc!
Plankton: [yelling] No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work! You're still sick! Very, very sick! [Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is flipping burgers normally]
Mr. Krabs: Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can safely say, "No more 24 hour shifts", because 23 hours will be plenty! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs...! [SpongeBob then starts laughing]
Mr. Krabs: No, seriously. Get back to work!


[The episode begins with Patchy rowing his boat next to Bikini Atoll.]
Patchy: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! [turns to the screen and laughs as his hat spins] Hey, kiddies! It's your old pal, Patchy, floating somewhere over Bikini Bottom. I sailed down here to witness something that only happens every 100 years. Why, me and my trusted parrot, Potty, wouldn't miss it for the world, would we, Potty? Potty?
Potty: Rah! [hits Patchy] I'm just here for the buffet. [grabs a fish from the water]
Patchy: Oh, Potty! [grumbles] Give me that! [drops the fish in the boat; he picks it up with his mouth and spits it back in the water] Potty, I told you to leave those fish alone! What do you think you are, a seahawk? [laughs]
Potty: I can't help if I was born a predator. Rah!
Patchy: Oh, Potty. I guess you're right. Can you ever forgive me? Shake. [Potty bites his fingers] Oh! Oh! Oh! [groans]
Potty: Now I can. Rah!
Patchy: Oh, get out of here! [chuckles as he pulls out a really long telescope] Yep! Whoosh! [dips the telescope in the water, laughs, and sees SpongeBob and the gang throwing Sandy a birthday party in Jellyfish Fields] Oh, oh, yeah! I'm gonna save these mental pictures for me grandkids. [chuckles and peeks through the telescope with his other eye] Oh, that's better.
[SpongeBob gives Sandy a birthday cake.]
Everyone: ♪Squirrelly birthday, dear Sandy, squirrelly birthday to you♪ [cheering] Hooray!
Sandy: Y'all are the best aquatic critter friends a lone star from out of town could ever have.
Patrick: Cake time! [pounds on the table]
Sandy: Wah!
[Sandy's birthday cake flies into Patrick's mouth. Patrick swallows the cake whole and licks the icing off his face.]
SpongeBob: [gives Sandy another cake] Don't worry. I always carry a spare.
[Patrick goes to pound the table again.]
Sandy: Oh, no you don't! [lifts the cake in the air] Hoo-hah! Karate slice! Hi-yah! [karate chops the cake into pieces for her friends]
SpongeBob: Enjoy the cake, everybody. I made it special just for Sandy. [eats the cake] Mm.
Squidward: I'm allergic to nuts. Are there any nuts in that?
SpongeBob: Nope, no nuts.
Squidward: Oh, okay. [eats the cake]
SpongeBob: Oh, unless you count "wall nuts."
Squidward: What? [his face swells up]
SpongeBob: I'm pretty sure walnuts are a fruit though, huh?
[Squidward groans. Pearl, Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff eat their slices of the cake. Mr. Krabs goes to give Mrs. Puff a piece of his cake.]
Mrs. Puff: Mmm!
[All of a sudden, the ground shakes.]
Mrs. Puff: Whoa—oh—oh—oh—oh! [Mr. Krabs accidentally pokes Mrs. Puff in the eye with his fork]
[Larry does some weight-lifting while eating some cake.]
Larry: [feels the ground shaking] Huh? Whoa! [falls over]
Sandy: [feels the ground shaking] Whoa! [falls over and gets up] Tex Ritter! You don't see that everyday. [she runs over to a volcano, but as she gets closer, a spooky, green-glowing moon comes out from the top] Huh?
Everyone: Ooh! Pretty!
Larry: Last time I saw a moon that big, it was in a locker room. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Since when is the moon so green?
Patrick: [chuckles and munches on some cake] Everyone knows the moon is made of cheese, SpongeBob. [swallows some cake] It's just been up there so long, it's getting moldy. [his pupils turn green] Oh, but I'd still eat it. [eats some more cake]
Sandy: That ain't the moon, guys. The real moon comes out at night, remember? Something's fishy going on here.
Dad: [laughs as he plays ball with his family] Attagirl, Sissy!
Daughter: I got it, Dad!
Billy: Look out, Mom!
Mable-Monica: Hey, kids, check out that cool, glowing rock in the sky.
[The green moon flies over the family. However, something unexpected happened. When the green moon's light touches them, their bodies glow green and one by one, they transform into realistic fish. Then they eat the ball.]
Sandy: You don't see that everyday. Did you see that, SpongeBob? Sponge...Bob?
[All of Sandy's friends are completely brainwashed by the green moon's light. The green moon flies over Frankie Billy, who is flying a kite.]
Frankie Billy: Huh?
[The green moon transforms Frankie Billy into a realistic trout. Then he eats his kite. Sandy gasps and rubs her eyes in shock.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both chanting] Green cheese! Green cheese! Green cheese!
[The green moon flies over SpongeBob and Patrick and they both transform into realistic sea creatures. SpongeBob is transformed into a realistic sea sponge while Patrick is transformed into a realistic starfish.]
Sandy: SpongeBob? Patrick? [SpongeBob and Patrick crawl around, eating little bugs in the grass; Sandy gasps and runs towards her friends] Everyone listen to me! Get away from the light! The light is bad! Run for the shade!
[But it was too late. Sandy's friends completely immobilized by the green moon and they won't move an inch.]
Mrs. Puff: So romantic. [shoves Mr. Krabs in the shoulder]
Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho!
Mrs. Puff: Eugene-ikins, give me some sugar.
Mr. Krabs: I'm always a sucker for a good smooch.
[But before they kiss, the green moon flies over them and it transforms them into realistic sea creatures. Mr. Krabs is transformed into a realistic crab while Mrs. Puff is transformed into a realistic puffer fish. Mr. Krabs pinches Mrs. Puff in the lips with his claw. Mrs. Puff puffs up and sends Mr. Krabs flying to a coral reef. Mr. Krabs crawls underneath the coral reef to hide.]
Pearl: [talking to one of her friends on the phone] Yeah, walk outside and check out this awesome moon. [takes a picture with her phone]
[The green moon flies over Pearl and it transforms her into a realistic sperm whale.]
Phone: Hello? Hello, Pearl?
[Pearl swallows her phone. Larry is looking at the green moon while doing some weight-lifting. The green moon flies over Larry and it transforms him into a realistic lobster. It looks as though if Sandy is the only sole survivor of the green moon's effect. The green moon slowly turns its light towards Sandy.]
Sandy: No! Not me! [screams as the light passes over her, but to her surprise, the green moon doesn't seem to effect her at all] Huh? I guess it only effects sea creatures, but I still don't get why that green moon is turning everyone into wild swimming fish? [gasps] Am I the only one left?
[Sandy hears a toilet flushing from the restrooms. It turns out that the only friend who hasn't been transformed under the effects of the green moon is Squidward. He had quietly slipped away to the restrooms while Sandy's attention was on the green moon.]
Squidward: Oh, whoever used that restroom last was an animal! [Sandy grabs Squidward just before the green moon can get him] Hey, put me down! Sandy! What are you doing? Ow! That hurts! [Sandy shoves Squidward under a rock to protect him from the green moon; he groans] What is the meaning of—
Sandy: Get in the shade! [shoves Squidward underneath with her foot just as the green moon flies by]
Squidward: I demand an explanation!
Sandy: I'm getting one right now, Squidward! [dials a number on her communicator]
[The communicator contacts the French Narrator, who is traveling in a submarine.]
French Narrator: [answers the phone] Hello? French Narrator speaking.
Sandy: Hey, Frenchy! It's me, Sandy!
French Narrator: Ah, Sandy Cheeks. [holds up a picture of Sandy] How is it hanging?
Sandy: Oh, it's not hanging too good, Frenchy. You see, there's this—
French Narrator: Don't say another word. I have been monitoring the behavior of the green moon all day. It is called Neptune's Moon. Every 100 years, it de-evolves everyone in Bikini Bottom into primal fish for two hours.
Sandy: Two hours?
French Narrator: Until it falls into another volcano and is extinguished. [gives a demonstration of Neptune's Moon and his experiment splatters green goo on his helmet]
Sandy: I knewed it was nature, dagnabit! That's a relief. So I just have to keep Squidward in the shade for a couple of hours. [Squidward becomes easily frightened when he sees wild fish eating each other] Whew! Thanks, Frenchy.
Squidward: [screams and crawls out from under the rock] I'm going home to hide under the covers! It's every cephalopod for himself! [he idiotically runs toward Neptune's Moon]
Sandy: [gasps] Frenchy, I gotta call you back! [runs after Squidward] Squidward, you have to stay in the shade!
[Squidward trips and falls over. He is cornered by a carnivorous fish.]
Squidward: [screams] Help!
Sandy: Squidward! No!
[Just as the carnivorous fish was about the eat Squidward, Neptune's Moon flies over Squidward and it transforms him into a realistic giant octopus. Squidward eats the fish and rushes towards Sandy.]
Sandy: O.M. Jehoshaphat! You don't see that everyday. [dodges Squidward's tentacle and hops on the jellyfish] My friends are gonna be lunch if I don't think fast! [gets stung, jumps down, and grabs a net; Squidward destroys the picnic table] SpongeBob! Patrick! [scoops up SpongeBob and Patrick with the net] Mrs. Puff! Mr. Krabs! [scoops up Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs with the net] Larry! [picks up Larry; Mr. Krabs pinches Sandy's tail with his claw] Yeeouch! [throws Larry in the net and runs toward Pearl] Look out, Pearl! I'll save you! Yee-ha! [jumps onto Pearl's tailfin; Squidward nearly bites Sandy, but Pearl manages to swim away; Sandy laughs in relief now that her friends are safe] Like busting a bronco! Yee-ha! [Pearl swims away from Jellyfish Fields; Sandy rips the net off the stick and holds it by her tail; Pearl breaks the Bikini Bottom sign as she continues swimming] Whoa—oh—oh—oh! [Pearl flips her tail, causing Sandy to tumble towards the blowhole] Not the blowhole! [Sandy falls in the blowhole; Pearl blasts Sandy out and send her crashing underneath a flying airplane; the passengers and crew of the plane are transformed into realistic fish due to the effects of Neptune's Moon; Sandy falls on Pearl's back and the plane crashes offscreen, killing the passengers and crew onboard; Pearl then swims over Bikini Bottom, where the citizens are looking directly at Neptune's Moon] Hey! Everybody! The light is bad! Stay away from the light!
Highway Speed Officer: License and registration, please?
[Nat Peterson takes out his driver's license. Just as the officer was going to write up a ticket, Neptune's Moon flies over them and transformed Nat and the officer into realistic fish. Pearl swims away from Bikini Bottom and swims towards the surface.]
Sandy: Hold your breath, creatures!
[On the surface, Patchy sees Pearl heading straight towards him through his telescope.]
Patchy: Uh-oh! [panicked screams] A Whale! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! [rows his boat out of Pearl's way; Pearl leaps over Patchy and Potty and jumps back into the ocean, splashing water into Patchy's boat] Oh! Oh, Potty! We're taking on water! [starts bailing water] A little help here, please, Potty? [Potty splashes Patchy with a bucket of water] Oh! Get out of here, you fiendish feather duster! Shoo! Shoo! I said, shoo! I'll do it meself. I don't need your help. I'm perfectly fine doing it by meself. [continues bailing water]
[Pearl swims downward from the surface and swims over Bikini Bottom. Then she swims toward's Sandy's treedome.]
Sandy: [screams] Here's where we get off! [Pearl drops Sandy and her friends off at the treedome and Sandy jumps off her back] Thanks for the lift, Pearl! Don't you worry. Nobody's going to eat you guys on my watch. [Mr. Krabs pinches Sandy's hand with his claw] Ow! [inside her treedome, Sandy puts SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff and Larry in a little aquarium; she feeds them fish food] Dinner time! Come and get it! [her transformed friends eat the food] This is so fascinating, Frenchy. Tell me more about my fishy friends. Oh, wait. I'll put you on speaker phone. [puts her communicator on speaker phone]
French Narrator: [about Larry] Ah, the lobster. The cockroach of the sea. Skittering across the ocean floor, the lobster sheds its skin once a week...[Larry molts his shell and eats it] And then eats it.
Sandy: Now that's what I call recycling, huh, Frenchy?
French Narrator: [about Mr. Krabs, who is eating garbage] Ah, notice the scavenger crab eating garbage [about Mrs. Puff] unaware he is being stalked by his natural predator, the puffer fish.
[Mrs. Puff stalks Mr. Krabs and eats him.]
Sandy: Oh, no, you don't.
[Mr. Krabs pinches Mrs. Puff's mouth with his claw.]
Mrs. Puff: Ow! [she and Mr. Krabs fight, but they are scooped out by Sandy]
Sandy: I knew I was gonna have to separate you two. [pulls Mr. Krabs out of Mrs. Puff's mouth] You're welcome, Mr. Krabs. [giggles, but gets pinched by Mr. Krabs again] Ow! [Mr. Krabs pinches her really hard] Yeowch! [throws Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff back in the aquarium; Mrs. Puff stalks Mr. Krabs again]
French Narrator: [about Patrick as he ejects his stomach from his body to eat kelp] Ah, observe how the hungry sea star ejects his own stomach from his body in order to eat his meal, [about SpongeBob as he filter feeds bacteria] where the primitive sea sponge filters nutrients and oxygen from bacteria particles.
[Bacteria scream as they are being filtered in SpongeBob's body. SpongeBob laughs as Sandy takes a picture.]
Sandy: SpongeBob is never gonna believe this.
[Suddenly, a shadow looms over Sandy. It turns out that the shadow is Squidward, who is now hovering over the treedome. Sandy whimpers in fear.]
French Narrator: [about Squidward] Ah, the giant octopus. One of the largest predators on the ocean floor.
Sandy: Texas toast! It's a good thing my treedome is made of ten tons of pressure proof glass, huh, Frenchy?
French Narrator: Oui, Sandy, that is true, but, unfortunately, the poisonous and highly intelligent octopus can also cut through hard bedrock with its beak.
[Squidward drills a hole through the treedome with his beak.]
Sandy: You don't see that everyday! Squidward, no!
[But it was too late. Squidward broke through the treedome and floods the entire place. Sandy grabs her helmet and puts it back on. Squidward breaks the entire treedome and goes to eat his friends. Sandy scoops up SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff and Larry, then hides them inside her tree.]
Sandy: Whoa! [almost gets hit by Squidward's tentacle as it wraps around the tree] Oh! [gets grabbed by Squidward's tentacle and is held in the air; Squidward breaks through the door with his beak] Hi-yah! [her hand breaks] Aah, hominy grits! [Squidward goes to eat his friends]
French Narrator: Ah, the battle for the survival of the fittest rages on in the animal kingdom.
Sandy: My friends! My tree!
French Narrator: Sandy, you must remember, who is the natural enemy of the octopus?
Sandy: That's a great idea. [breaks herself free and uses her tail to create echolocation]
French Narrator: Using her versatile tail, the Texas Land squirrel calls out to the natural enemy of the octopus.
Sandy: There she blows, y'all!
French Narrator: The whale.
[Pearl bellows as she comes to the rescue. Pearl swims up to Squidward.]
Sandy: Sick 'em, Pearl! Sorry, Squidward!
[Pearl and Squidward go into an all out battle for each other. SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, and Larry crawl over to Sandy for protection. Squidward pokes Pearl in the eye and Pearl whacks Squidward with her tail. Squidward tangles Pearl with his tentacles, but Pearl blows water at Squidward through her blowhole.]
Sandy: Ooh! Ohh!
[Pearl begins gnawing on Squidward. At that moment, Sandy's watch rings.]
Sandy: Oh! Two hours is up? Thank goodness.
French Narrator: And so we bid a fond adieu to Neptune's Moon as it descends back into the Earth from whence it came. We will see it again in 100 years. [Neptune's Moon slowly descends downwards and enters another volcano; foghorn blows] Goal!
[Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff fight each other again. However, now that Neptune's Moon is gone, they both revert themselves back into their regular forms. But unfortunately, the effects of Neptune's Moon also caused their respective clothing to dissolve into nothingness, thus leaving them naked]
Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff: Oops.[Krabs and Mrs. Puff cover themselves in embarrassment and run off laughing.]
[Larry reverts back to his regular form as well. But he is also naked. He picks up a flower and uses it as a loincloth. Then he walks away. Pearl and Squidward continue fighting above Sandy's treedome. They both revert back to their regular forms. However, they're also naked as well. Pearl spits Squidward out from her mouth.]
Squidward: What is going on here? [gasps] My clothes! [screams and runs away]
Pearl: [screams and runs away as she is naked] No!
[SpongeBob and Patrick revert back to the regular forms, but they're also naked as well.]
Sandy: Aah!
[SpongeBob pulls himself off of Sandy's suit. Patrick giggles and falls off of Sandy's helmet. SpongeBob looks around and sees Sandy's treedome destroyed.]
SpongeBob: Um, Sandy, how come your treedome is broken and everyone's naked?
Sandy: Well, SpongeBob, let's just say this has been the most interesting birthday I ever had.
French Narrator: And, of course, Neptune's Moon is always followed by Neptune's Sun.
[The ground shakes. Neptune's Sun comes out of a volcano and shines its light on Sandy. The light then transforms Sandy into a realistic land squirrel. It appears that Neptune's Sun only effects land creatures while Neptune's Moon only effects sea creatures. Sandy chitters and crawls around inside her suit.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: You don't see that everyday. Jinx! Buy me a patty! [both laugh as Sandy chitters]
[The scene changes to Bikini Atoll.]
French Narrator: Ah, Bikini Bottom. Teaming with life and naked mysteries. This next whale song is going out to my favorite squirrel. Sandy, happy birthday.
Sandy: [as she water skis across the ocean] Yee haw! Whoo!
Patchy: Ooh, Potty, I never thought it'd end up like this, brunch for a shark.
Potty: I guess this is it. Good-bye, Patchy.
Patchy: Good-bye, Potty. [crying]
[A shark fin pops up from the surface. Patchy and Potty scream in fright. But it turns out to be the French Narrator.]
Patchy: Huh?
French Narrator: Hello!
Patchy: Frenchy, you surprising scallywag! Get—What are you doing here?
French Narrator: Ah, Patchy the pirate, I just swam back to warn you about Neptune's Sun, but it's too late. Au revoir. [leaves]
Patchy: Bye. Neptune's Sun? [Suddenly, just as the French Narrator said, Neptune's Sun flies over Patchy and Potty; Patchy whimpers and screams] What's happening?!
[Neptune's Sun transforms Potty into a pterodactyl while Patchy transforms into a primitive cave man. Patchy and Potty look at each other and notice they are different from before. Patchy grunts in confusion. But Potty thinks Patchy is a Krabby Patty.]
Potty: Mm, yummy. [laughs as he grabs Patchy and flies away with him; ending the episode]


Patrick: [walks down the street wearing a tie, green jeans, a hat and carrying a briefcase. He stops and rips off his tie] Uhh. Such a tired day at the office. [looks at his watch] Boy, am I famished. I sure wish I knew the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom. [smell comes and Patrick's stomach morphs into a nose shape] From where has this glorious scent come?
Squidward: [comes to Patrick] Hark, the odor you seek is before you.
Mr. Krabs: [jumps out from Krusty Krab's doors wearing a leotard] At the Krusty Krab, where the tastiest sandwich in the seas is grilled to perfection by our expert fry cook. [raises hand to SpongeBob who comes out sky sliding on rainbow holding a spatula] And served with a smile by our friendly waiter. [Squidward arrives on a dolphin with a platter of Krabby Patties and gives the plate to Patrick, Patrick pours the Krabby Patties into his mouth, then it reveals that it was all a storyboard planned by SpongeBob for a commercial]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Nom nom nom nom nom.
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute. Why am I dressed in a leotard?
SpongeBob: Oh, cause you're the mascot.
Mr. Krabs: Nah, I don't think so! [he tears off the storyboard pictures on the wall as SpongeBob looks in horror, some pieces of the shreds flies into SpongeBob's face and he blows it off him] We need a gimmic that's nothing short of a masterpiece.
SpongeBob: Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesdays! [Mr. Krabs stops walking and SpongeBob bumps into him. Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob out of the kitchen. SpongeBob looks depressed and sighs louder and louder and louder which irritates Squidward.]
Squidward: Oh, for dolphins sakes! Do tell what's troubling you so!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping.
Squidward: Shocking.
SpongeBob: I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimic.
Squidward: Sounds like you'd better stop bothering me and put on your thinking cap.
SpongeBob: Great idea, Squidward! [zooms off]
Squidward: That'll keep him out of my hair. [rattling engine noises are heard and smoke engulfs around Squidward. Squidwards sees SpongeBob wearing a big blue machine of his head saying thinking as SpongeBob thinks really hard for an idea.] Of course, he actually has one. [Squidward leaves his cash register and sees a strange patron squirting ketchup all over the Krabby Patties. He then picks them up and drops them all over the floor] To each, his own.
Fiasco: Mustard!
Squidward: Yes, your freakishness. [he swipes the mustard from Squidward's hand and squirts it all over the platter. Squidward sighs in disgust as mustard splashes onto his face]
Fiasco: [drops the empty mustard condiment as he is finished] Like our own fleeting existence, an untimely end has come upon this Krabby value meal. [he notices something on the platter and scrapes it off before he leaves]
Squidward: Good riddance. [just as Squidward was about to spray the table, he he quickly notices what the patron has done on the platter] What's this? Something's familiar about those ketchup swirls. [gasps] Sweet Neptune! Could that have been...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah enough dilly-dallying. Now, help me with the garbage Mr. Squidward. [Mr. Krabs takes the platter and tries to throw it away, but Squidward takes it from him] 
Squidward: That's not garbage, it's a Fiasco!
Mr. Krabs: Ok, let's not overdo it.
Squidward: No, no, no, you don't get it! It's the work of Fiasco the artist! [pulls out the Art Wonk magazine] He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!
Mr. Krabs: [reads the magazine and sees the picture of Fiasco and his art in it] Heh, you call this art? Looks like a swappy's footlocker.
Squidward: It all makes sense now! The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow! This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!
SpongeBob: [takes the Fiasco from Squidward] Ohh, what is this?
Squidward: [takes it back from SpongeBob] This is an authentic Fiasco!
Customers: A Fiasco? [gets up from their tables and looks at the Fiasco in amazement] Ooh!
Dave: An original Fiasco, you say?
Gus: He's one of the famous picture-drawing artistes!
Nancy-Suzy Fish: Just look at his audacious use of pickle in this piece.
Jimmy Gus: [stutters] What's your asking price?
Squidward: Oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars.
Mr. Krabs: Hold it! [takes the Fiasco]  I'll take a million for it.
Squidward: [takes it back] It's not yours to sell! I found it!
Mr. Krabs: Me plate, me buns, me mustard, [tries to take it from Squidward] me Fiasco.
Squidward: You tried to throw it away! [pulls it back] It's mine!
Farfel Bainbridge: Let's not be hasty. It belongs to…neither of you. Farfel Bainbridge: Curator of the Bikini Bottom Art Museum. We curators have a way of sniffing these things out. [takes the Fiasco from Squidward and examines it. He sniffs it for a little bit] [gasps] It's authentic! Aahh! Which makes this a national treasure! [everyone cheers as Farfel places the Fiasco back on the table and puts a glass lid around it] And for preservation, it must be hermetically sealed! [blows his whistle] And guarded by Bikini Bottom's finest! [three police men rip off their costumes, revealing themselves]
Officer John: Ready for duty, sir!
Mr. Krabs: Great idea, Farkle. Gotta protect me valuable property.
Farfel Bainbridge: Well, technically, it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the people of Bikini Bottom. Unfortunately, they'll have to set foot in this grease-trap to get a look at this great piece of art.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic. [goes to a scene where the Krusty Krab has a really long line waiting to see the Fiasco] Step up! Step up for your free glimpse at the Fiasco masterpiece! [Evelyn and Frankie look at the Fiasco] Alright, you've had your look. Now hold up your end of the bargain!
Frankie Billy: Two Krabby Patties, please.
Mr. Krabs: Each!
Plankton: [while all the customers are lined up, Plankton sneaks up behind a small rock outside of the Chum Bucket] So, what have you got for me today, huh? [looks through his telescope] No Krabby Patty in sight. [notices the customers looking at the Fiasco] What? What's this? Looks like a chewed-up Krabby Patty. A perfect sample from which to reverse engineer a whole Krabby Patty! [gets down and paddles to the Krusty Krab with a tiny bag on a unicycle] Thanks, Eugene. You just made my job a whole lot easier.
Mr. Krabs: [As Mr. Krabs counts his money and sniffs some of them from his valuable success, he hears a loud scream in the dining room] I know that scream anywhere! It's me profits dying! [opens his office door and sees Plankton making a getaway with the Fiasco in his bag] Stop that thief!
Plankton: Don't worry, Krabs! I'm just taking out the trash for ya!
Mr. Krabs: Stop thief! [pushes the alarm button and emergency bell rings and alarm blares; Cut to the police car driving after Plankton]
Plankton: Heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. Plankton old boy, you're home-free! [Just then, he hears the sirens of the police cars. As he turns around, he notices several more police cars following him at high pursuit.]
Officer John: Stop thief!
Plankton: Ahh! [paddles faster] What's with the police?! It's just a bag of garbage! [the police chases Plankton into the streets of Bikini Bottom and passes by the Movie Palace. Plankton manages to take refuge in the movie theater] What's going on?
Female movie character: How long do you think we'll be here?
Male movie character: I don't know. But my stomach feels all tingly.
Female movie character: Mine does too. [the movie characters slowly attempt to kiss, until Officer Rob bursts through the screen]
Officer Rob: Hey you! Yeah, you in the chair!
Officer John: Don't move! [the cops burst out of the screen and chases Plankton out of the movie theater and into the supermarket]
Plankton: [as the cops search all over the market, Plankton hides in a batch of flowers but his eyes gets all watery due to the pollen] Achoo! [the cops turn around and sees where Plankton is hiding] Blasted pollen allergies! [Plankton notices that the cops are looking at him and quickly runs out of the market as the cops chase him from behind. He somehow manages to take refuge in a floating satellite in outer space, thinking that he is safe.] Ahh, I should be safe in space. [he hears the hatch door open and sees that the cops are still after him only in spacesuits this time]
Officer John: Stop thief!
Plankton: You gotta be kidding me! [exits out of the satellite as the cops pursue from behind. Sooner or later, Plankton becomes exhausted from being chased around by the cops. He then stumbles upon Patrick's rock] Hello? Hello? [knocks] Open up! [continues knocking] Open up!
Patrick: [opens his rock as he is in his purple robe] Do you mind? Some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning! [slams his rock]
Plankton: Wait, what? [looks around and sees SpongeBob's house and bursts in the front door with a wooden spoon in his hand] Hey, keep your hands where I can see em'! [SpongeBob raises his hands in the air] Ok you two, against the wall! [SpongeBob and Gary get off of the chair and sofa and walk up towards the wall] That's it. Nice and slow. [Plankton walks into the house and places the bag on the table revealing the Fiasco he has stolen to SpongeBob. Plankton jumps up onto SpongeBob's chair] You gotta help me! Ever since I left the Krusty Krab, I've had all kinds of heat on me! It's so bizarre! Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!
SpongeBob: I-I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune.
Plankton: Really?
SpongeBob: So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.
Plankton: Interesting. It appears I've won more than I bargained for.
SpongeBob: Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do.
Plankton: You mean hold onto it until it's really worth something?
SpongeBob: No, you need to turn yourself in.
Plankton: Turn myself-What?! If I go down, we all go down! You're harboring an art thief!
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Plankton: Me, you imbecile!
SpongeBob: What?
Plankton: Not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah.
SpongeBob: Really?
Plankton: And not only that, but Gary's an accomplice too!
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Now you've gone too far!
Plankton: No, you have! Criminal Accomplice!
SpongeBob: I can't believe you're calling me that!
Plankton: Believe it, Man Boy!
Patrick: [comes in and appears to be eating something] Hey! What did I tell you before? I'm trying to get some shuteye!
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you eating?
Patrick: The hors d'oeuvres you left on the table. [an empty plate is shown as it reveals that Patrick is eating the Fiasco that Plankton stole. SpongeBob and Plankton gasp in horror as Patrick swallows the Fiasco and burps] Not bad.
SpongeBob: Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!
Plankton: Ohh, he's an accomplice too!
Squidward: [bursts through the front door with the cops behind him] Here they are, Officers! These idiots have been causing a ruckus. Interrupting my beauty sleep.
Officer John: Well, well, well. If it isn't the art thief himself. Drop the spoon. [Plankton throws the spoon away after realizing he has no place to run anymore] You're all under arrest until we figure this out. [puts handcuffs on Squidward's wrists]
Squidward: But what do you mean "all"? [stammering] I'm not under arrest! I..I..I..uhh.. These are idiots! They're causing a ruckus! I..I want sleep! [cuts to the Bikini Bottom Police Station]
Officer John: [locks Plankton away in jail as SpongeBob, Patrick, Gary, and Mr. Krabs stand there and watch] Thanks for clearing this whole mess up, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Of course, Officer. Heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. It'll ruin me business! Especially, now that the Fiasco's finito! [begins to cry]
SpongeBob: [thinks for a second and comes up with an idea, snaps his fingers] Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution. [cuts to the Krusty Krab with a really long line]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks very much. Enjoy the show. You sure saved the day boy-yo.
SpongeBob: My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too.
Patrick: [stands behind the x-ray and presents the Fiasco he accidentally ate to the customers, which amazes them. As he is showing it to them, he giggles for a little bit] X-rays tickle.
Fiasco: Such artistic genius! [throws his paintings on the floor and smashes them to bits] I'll never paint again!
Squidward: [reveals that he is still behind bars at the Bikini Bottom Police Station] Hey, don't I get a phone call?


[the episode begins with Gary snoring and meowing]
SpongeBob: Wake up, Gary.
Gary: [wakes up] Meow?
SpongeBob: We're moving today!
Gary: [quizzically] Meow?
SpongeBob: That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants! [puts on a hat and fake beard]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [He takes away Gary's bowl] No more food. [gives Gary a plate with clams on it] Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells. [SpongeBob puts salt in the shells, and Gary starts crying] April Fools! [takes off the outfit and puts Gary's food bowl back onto the floor] There ya go, pal!
Gary: Meow. [eats]
SpongeBob: [goes into the kitchen] Whew, I'm thirsty! [takes a big glass of lemonade out of the fridge] [male voice] This is an extreme thirst! [sets the lemonade down on the floor; bubble transition to him putting all the lemonade into a lot of small glasses with umbrellas]
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!! [holds up a mirror] ...To me! [laughs obnoxiously and walks outside and towards work. Squidward sees him]
Squidward: What's he so happy about? [walks by the calendar and notices it's April Fools Day. He panics] April 1st? [screams] April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday! [puts a heating pad on his head and dials the number for the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today, I caught something terrible.
Mr. Krabs: [over phone] What'd ya catch?
Squidward: I caught sight of the calendar.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.
[Squidward runs to the Krusty Krab with an artist uniform on]
Squidward: I have arrived. [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh] What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh more]
Mr. Krabs: You just missed him.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but he told us to tell you...
Squidward: Tell me what?
SpongeBob: [whispers into Squidward's ear] He told me to tell you... April Fools.
Squidward: [lays his hat on the table] Well, it's been nice working here. [he walks off] Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait!
Squidward: Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward! [grabs Squidward's legs] It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!
Squidward: You do?
SpongeBob: Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?
[Mr. Krabs sits on a whoopee cushion and it "farts." SpongeBob laughs]
Squidward: Well, as long as it's not me.
[bubble transition to SpongeBob carrying a tray of burger patties when an old lady comes by]
Miss Shell: Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?
SpongeBob: They're riiiight here, lady! [leads her to the utensils]
Miss Shell: [picks up a spoon] But, this is a spoon...
SpongeBob: APRIL FOOLS! [laughs; Squidward stares at SpongeBob and he runs away; bubble transition to SpongeBob behind the register; a customer comes up to him] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?
Nat: [raises up his left arm] Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [points at something] Hey, what's that?
[Nat turns around; SpongeBob turns around and has a smiley face on his back]
Nat: Well, I didn't see anything... [notices that SpongeBob is gone] hey, where'd that other guy go?
[SpongeBob turns around]
SpongeBob: April Fools!! I'm right here!!
Nat: [laughs] Hey, that was pretty good.
[SpongeBob laughs obnoxiously; Squidward notices SpongeBob behind the register]
Squidward: What are you doing behind the counter?
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob wiping the floor; Tom comes by with a cup of soda]
Tom: Excuse me, can I get a couple of ice cubes in here, please?
SpongeBob: Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up! [fills the cup with ice and comes back whistling] Here you go.
Tom: Thanks. [he takes a sip of his drink; SpongeBob titters and Tom looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before Tom turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom takes another sip of his drink; SpongeBob starts giggling again and then Tom turns around and looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before he turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom finishes his drink] Ah.
SpongeBob: [laughs loudly and obnoxiously] April Fools! [Tom grabs SpongeBob by the collar, suddenly panicked]
Tom: WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY DRINK?!
SpongeBob: I... [giggles] I... [giggles]
Tom: YOU WHAT?!?!
SpongeBob: You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one! [laughs]
Tom: I guess that is pretty funny! [laughs as he walks off]
SpongeBob: [laughs so hard his tongue pops off] Hey, your shoes untied. [tongue looks down] April Fools! You're not wearing shoes! [laughs and hugs his tongue, which smiles. Then they laugh into the microphone; everyone hears it; in the kitchen, Squidward tries to mute the sound with tissues, but he can still hear it] APRIL FOOOOOLS! [Squidward drops a plate]
Squidward: That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about! [bubble transition to him squirting some mustard inside a rope circle then he chuckles and shows SpongeBob the mess]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up! [starts cleaning it and Squidward is standing next to a rope which he is about to cut]
Squidward: APRIL FOOLS! [laughs as he cuts the rope which grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Whooaahh! [the rope sends him into a bag of flour. Squidward is laughing through all of this and rolls on the floor. Then SpongeBob is taken around a bar] Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl... [screams as he is sent slamming face-first into the wall]
Customers: Oh, no!
[Squidwards eyes pop out as he laughs hysterically. SpongeBob screams and flies into Bubble Bass' rear]
SpongeBob: Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [Cut to Squidward cheerleading, laughing, and jumping into the air. Then SpongeBob smashes into the ceiling]
Squidward: [runs and holds out his arms to catch SpongeBob] I'll catch you, SpongeBob! [he giggles to himself. SpongeBob screams as he plummets toward Squidward, who quickly sets out a garbage can in front of him, and SpongeBob falls into the goop in the can] Oops. [dumps SpongeBob, who is now the shape of the can, out of the garbage can] April Fools, you little sausage! [he laughs]
SpongeBob: ...Ohhh!&#160;:( [SpongeBob sobs hysterically and runs out of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You all know I was just kidding… Right?
Wobbles: Aww, man, poor kid.
Shubie: That guy has definitely got some issues to work out. [The customers angrily glare at Squidward as they begin to leave]
Olive green fish: April Fools... jerk. [All the customers storm out the door in disgust] 
Squidward: Wait, don't go!
Man: Hey, you stink!
Squidward: Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh... [looks around at the mess he has made and winces, then he looks at Bubble Bass, who has a hole in his bottom due to the "prank" and Squidward starts to feel ashamed of himself] Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach. [makes silly face] Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo- [throat goes haywire] gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought. [bubble transition to Squidward going to SpongeBob's pineapple; he knocks on SpongeBob's door] SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob? [notices a Krusty Krab hat and goes over there to talk to the man who is wearing it] Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do, so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am... What? [notices that the guy with the hat on is Patrick] Patrick? What are you doing here?
Patrick: Digging.
Squidward: Why are you wearing that hat?
Patrick: Hmm, I don't know. [takes off the hat]
Squidward: [growls] Where's SpongeBob?
Patrick: He's in the house. He's impressed.
Squidward: With what?
Patrick: I don't know, but it must've been pretty good to make him cry like that.
Squidward: [shivers then goes back to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there! [tries to turn the handle, but SpongeBob's arm comes from under the door and pulls it inside; Squidward grabs his clarinet] SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this! [plays clarinet horribly. SpongeBob opens the door]
SpongeBob: What do you want?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. [sticks out tongue while talking]
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: I'm trying to say I'm [turns into a donkey and starts braying] hee-haw-hee-haw!
SpongeBob: What?!
Squidward: I'm just trying to say that I'm... [head explodes] There's gotta be an easier way to do this. [bubble transition to Squidward writing a note; he puts it in a bottle and rolls it to SpongeBob where he picks it up] Well, aren't you going to open it?
SpongeBob: I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.
Squidward: Doh! [Squidward hands SpongeBob a can and Squidward drives to the other side of the road] SpongeBob, I'm... [whispers into the can, then puts the can up to his ear but hears some sort of noise; Patrick is flossing his teeth with the cord; Squidward growls and throws the binoculars down on the ground] SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am... [waves tentacles in the air and bubbles form, puts a big bubble on his head and then talks] ...sorry. [pops the bubble] There you go.
SpongeBob: But I couldn't... [Squidward slams the door in his face]
Squidward: I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear! [Starts to walk away, when an image of Patrick appears in the air]
Patrick: It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that. [Squidward nervously continues walking and runs into a ghost image of a guy at the Krusty Krab]
Tom: April Fools, jerk. [Squidward frantically starts running again, but this time his mother appears]
Mrs. Tentacles: [male voice] YOU STINK!
Squidward: Mother? [runs back to SpongeBob's house to apologize] All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and... [SpongeBob opens the door slightly]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Is all that true?
Squidward: Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.
SpongeBob: Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
Squidward: What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.
SpongeBob: I promise.
Squidward: Really? [SpongeBob opens the door all the way, revealing the citizens of Bikini Bottom inside]
Everyone: April Fools!
Squidward: [twitches eye] April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all! [laughs hysterically while going back into his house]
SpongeBob: What would we do without Squidward?


[The exterior of The Krusty Krab is shown and a trumpet is heard. The interior is then shown. SpongeBob is shown on a barrel playing a trumpet next to a something that is hidden under a hanging red cloth. Sadie, Francis, Sheldon, Nat, Bill, and Pilar are sitting, eating, and staring at SpongeBob. Frank is walking to his table with his food, staring at SpongeBob. Fred and Frankie Billy are shown.]
Fred: A horn!
Frankie Billy: What will happen next?
[Mr. Krabs walks out of office, the lights turn off, and a spotlight turns on when he stops. Harry, John, Jimmy Gus, Sally, Abigail Marge, Pilar, and Mr. Krabs are staring at SpongeBob, who finishes playing the trumpet. Mr. Krabs is shown to be next to the hidden item. The scene shows a medium shot of Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Atten-- [He is interrupted by SpongeBob's squeaked high note on the trumpet. He growls and he marches to SpongeBob to stop the noise. Off-screen a series of noises occur. He marches back into the spotlight. SpongeBob appears to be stuck in his horn.] Attention, Krusty Krab [grabs rope] patrons! Be[pulls up curtain]hold!
[A jar of sesame seeds is shown on a barrel. The jar has a red lid and a question mark on the front. Fred and Frankie Billy are shown.]
Fred: It's a jar of seeds!
Frankie Billy: Bun seeds!
[The scene returns to Mr. Krabs. With both of his hands, he points to the Jar. Next to the jar there is a sign that reads, "Guess how many seeds in the jar and win a free Krabby Patty!". All of the words are red, except "free", which is green.]
Mr. Krabs: Today only, the Krusty Krab presents our first annual bun seed guessing contest! [quiet gasping can be heard.] Guess how many seeds are in the jar and win a f-- f-- sorry, a f-- f-- I'll try again. A f-- f-- [SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs and slaps him in the back of the neck.] free Krabby Patty!
[Sally, Dennis Rechid, Paco, Debbie Rechid, and Harold "Bill" Reginald are shown. All, except Sally are sitting.]
Sally, Dennis Rechid, Paco, Debbie Rechid, and Harold "Bill" Reginald: Ooh!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are shown next to the jar.]
Mr. Krabs: Step right up! [Fred walks up.] Guess right and win! [talking to SpongeBob] They'll never guess it.
[Fred is shown.]
Fred: Hmm. Three?
[Fred and Mr. Krabs are shown next to the jar.]
Mr. Krabs: No. Next, please.
[Nat walks up. He looks at the jar up close. He moves to the right side of the jar. He moves to the left side of the jar.]
Nat: 42?!
Mr. Krabs: [shakes head] Nope.
[Nat snaps his "fingers" and then walks away. Dave walks up and sniffs the jar.]
Dave: Billions and billions?
Mr. Krabs: N-n-no.
[Nancy Suzy Fish walks up and puts the jar in her mouth. She then swishes it around a bit and removed it, placing it back where it was.]
Suzy Fish: Blue?
Mr. Krabs: No.
Dennis Rechid: Mermaid Man?
Mr. Krabs: [He smacks his eyes.] That's not even a number.
[Someone clearing their throat off-screen is heard.]
Voice: I have a guess.
[The scene moves down to show that it is Plankton. He evilly laughs.]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! [He points to Plankton.] You don't get to guess.
[Mr. Krabs picks of Plankton.]
Plankton: Hey! [Mr. Krabs carries Plankton to the front door.] What? You can't do that! It's not fair!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm sorry, but it's me restaurant and I can do what I please! Besides, I know you'll try to analyze that patty and find out me secret formuler.
[Mr. Krabs throws Plankton into mouth as he lets out a scream. He then chews him into the consistency of gum and blows Plankton into a bubble. Mr. Krabs then blows him towards the Chum Bucket, where he makes a big splatter stain on the front door. Plankton's squished form drips to the ground and reforms into normal Plankton.]
Plankton: You'll pay for this, Krabs! I'm calling the Bogus Business Bureau!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, right. Like they would even take your call.
[Mr. Krabs laughs and walks back into Krusty Krab. Plankton takes out a cell phone and dials the number for the Bogus Business Bureau.]
Bogus Business Bureau Receptionist: Bogus Business Bureau.
Plankton: Hello, yes. I have a complaint.
[The scene shows Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and SpongeBob standing in the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs finishes laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: That Plankton cracks me up. Like the Bogus Business Bureau would care about my dumb contest.
[Mr. Krabs laughs. a helicopter is heard. two creatures break through the ceiling, one demolishing a table and one crushes Squidward into the ground. Squidward gets his head up and a chair crushes Squidward once again. An orange fish with a mustache is sitting on the chair. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are shown looking surprised.]
Agent Twirp: I am Agent Twirp of the Bogus [He stands up.] Business Bureau. [He walks to Mr. Krabs. It is revealed that he is shorter than SpongeBob.] Are you the proprietor of this... [He clears his throat.] establishment?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, uh, no. He's out of town.
SpongeBob: Don't be modest, Mr. Krabs. [to Agent Twirp] He's responsible for everything at the Krusty Krab.
[Mr. Krabs chuckles and pushes SpongeBob away.]
Mr. Krabs: New trainee.
Agent Twirp: According to article 57 of the Greasy Spoon Code, all fast food contests must be open to all customers, no matter how diminutive or annoying.
[The scene zooms into Agent Twirp's pocket and Plankton pops his head out.]
Plankton: And I'm both of those things! You have to let me guess now, [He jumps to the floor.] Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: I'm won't do it! [crosses arms] And you can't make me.
[Mr. Krabs blows raspberry]
Agent Twirp: If you refuse, I'll [pulls out tape that says "CLOSED"] shut down the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, fine!
Plankton: This round goes to Plankton!
[Plankton cackles and runs to the jar.]
SpongeBob: Golly, Mr. Krabs, what if Plankton guesses right and wins a [gasps and says next words in gasping voice] Krabby Patty?
[Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob close to him.]
Mr. Krabs: No worries. That nitwit Plankton hasn't got a chance.
Plankton: Hmm. [puts on eye equipment with numerous lenses. The device analyzes the bun seeds inside of the jar. He uses a calculator to calculate the analysis. He takes off the device and rips of the tape that the calculator was making.] There are exactly five hundred thousand... [Mr. Krabs gulps.] Three hundred...
Mr. Krabs: Oh, he's getting close.
Plankton: ...And one!
[Mr. Krabs laughs.]
Mr. Krabs: Wrong! It's five hundred thousand three hundred and none! You are one over the mark. You lose.
[Mr. Krabs laughs.]
Agent Twirp: Hold on! It's not official unless you count them.
[Plankton laughs.]
Plankton: Yeah!
[A card is shown with "A lot of boring math later..."]
French Narrator: A lot of boring math later...
[The scene returns to the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: 500298, 500299, 500300. [Plankton jumps off the jar and Mr. Krabs looks into it.] I win!
[Mr. Krabs laughs.]
Plankton: Eh!
[Plankton blows raspberry]
SpongeBob: Hold on. There's something on the lid. You missed a bun seed, Mr. Krabs! Plankton was-- right.
[SpongeBob tears in half.]
Plankton: YES!
Agent Twirp: I now command you to give Mr. Plankton his prize.
Plankton: You heard him, Krabs. Give me a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: I can't.
Plankton: What?!
[Agent Twirp pulls out the "CLOSED" tape again.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob needs to clean the grill first.
SpongeBob: I cleaned it this morning.
Mr. Krabs: Doesn't your spatula need aligning or something?
SpongeBob: Nope, she's perfectly aligned.
[Mr. Krabs crosses his arms.]
Mr. Krabs: Drat your efficiency! Uh, oh, yeah! [He snaps his "fingers".] I can't serve you your Patty until after the show!
Plankton: What show?
[Mr. Krabs runs to the sign, takes out a pen, and puts the cap in his mouth. He starts writing something on the board behind him.]
Mr. Krabs: The show that comes with a free Krabby Patty. [He shows the sign and it has, "and a show." on it. He spits the cap out of his mouth.] See?
Plankton: Oh, come on! Are you kidding me?
Agent Twirp: It clearly says, "and a show." I'll allow it.
Plankton: Drat!
[Mr. Krabs is shown cutting wood. Plankton is shown. Mr. Krabs is shown sewing a purple piece of cloth. He has pins in his mouth.]
Plankton: Is this part of [does finger quotes] "the show?"
[Mr. Krabs is shown in front of a puppet show stage with a paint brush.]
Mr. Krabs: No, this is isn't part of the show.
[He paints part of it.]
Agent Twirp: Mm, such lovely filigree, wouldn't you agree?
Plankton: Ugh.
[The curtains open. A character that is made of a Krabby Patty as it head, a fry container as its body, fries as its limbs, and fake eyes appears. SpongeBob slides up.]
SpongeBob: Puppets!
Mr. Krabs: Once upon a time, there was a happy Patty Laddie.
Patty Laddie: La la la la la la la la!
Mr. Krabs: He was beloved by all the good-hearted people in the world. Alas, there is also a villain in this story, by the name of [A green paper bag is shown with two straw antennas, two fry arms, two fangs, a red eye, and a unibrow.] Pla-- Flankton!
SpongeBob: Boo! Hiss!
[Mr. Krabs takes Flankton away and brings the Patty Laddie back up.]
Mr. Krabs: So, one day, when the lad was minding his own business, Flankton struck and took a huge bite out of the Laddie's face!
[Patty Laddie screams and Mr. Krabs takes ketchup out and sprays it around.]
Mr. Krabs: Ahh, My face! Ahhhhhhhh, My face!
Plankton: Okay, we get it already!
Mr. Krabs: Unfortunately for Flankton, [The Patty Laddie is shown as an angel.] the Patty didn't sit well with him. And he was so evil, it caused him to bloat something fierce... [Mr. Krabs inflates Flankton.] ...until eventurally he popped! [He pops the bag.] The end.
Plankton: [sarcastically, while clapping his hands] Oh, bravo. Bravo. Why does the puppet get to eat a Krabby Patty and I don't? And why aren't you in the kitchen cooking my patty?
Mr. Krabs: Alright, SpongeBob, we can't stall him any longer. Make a good one, laddie. This may be the last Patty you'll ever cook.
SpongeBob: I'll do my best, sir.
[He starts sobbing. He enters the kitchen and Squidward walks to Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob then looks out the window and cries. This makes Squidward and Mr. Krabs jump in surprise.]
Mr. Krabs: [whispering to Squidward] Psst. I got a plan. You keep that blasted bureaucrat busy.
[Mr. Krabs pushes Squidward towards Agent Twirp.]
Squidward: Uh, excuse me, Mr. Agent, sir. While we're waiting, perhaps I could direct your attention to-- oh, to the many code violations you'll find [He pushes Agent Twirp up and starts heading him away from his chair.] if you turn this way. It's a death trap.
[Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen and takes all of the buns and goes into the bathroom. He enters a stall. A customer leaves a stall and walks to the sink. Mr. Krabs is shown inserting the buns into the toilet. The customer is shown washing his hands. Mr. Krabs grunts. The customer stops washing his hands and stairs at the stall. Mr. Krabs gets on the toilet to try to push the patties down.]
Mr. Krabs: There we go. [He flushes the toilet.] Ooh, that takes care of that. [Mr. Krabs leaves the bathroom.] And in three, two, one.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob.  
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it's awful! We're all out of buns!
Mr. Krabs: No buns? Drat the luck! [Mr. Krabs sees a delievery truck pull up.]
Truck Driver: Got a delivery for the Krusty Krab. Where do you want us to put these buns?
SpongeBob: Huh, good thing I ordered us extra b-- for the contest crowd.
[SpongeBob then realizes his error as Mr. Krabs crosses his arms and looks at him for now understanding. The scene changes to show SpongeBob in from of the Cash register boat with the Kitchen door open. He takes off his hat and sadly plays trumpet as Squidward and Mr. Krabs bring Plankton the Krabby Patty.]
Plankton: Finally! At long last, the Krabby Patty is mine! Go ahead and wrap that up, son. I'll take it to go.
SpongeBob: One Krabby Patty to go. [SpongeBob puts the Krabby Patty in a "to go" bag.] [Off-Screen] Here you are.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, you don't! [He takes the bag] You have to eat it on the premises. [He puts the patty on the plate.] Them's the rules. 
[Mr. Krabs runs off-screen and runs back with the contest sign. It has, "Must be eaten at the Krusty Krab" on it.]
Plankton: Yeah, that's what it says.
Mr. Krabs: So?
Plankton: Okay, okay. I will! [He eats Krabby Patty whole.] I bid you good day, sir.
[Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton.]
Mr. Krabs: You gotta swallow it here on the premises.
Plankton: Oh, come on.
Agent Twirp: I'll allow it.
Plankton: Fine! [He swallows it whole and pants.] Can I go now?
[Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton and throws him back to the Chum Bucket. He slides into the lab and gets on to a table.]
Plankton: Karen, quick! You gotta cut this Krabby Patty out of me, stat!
Karen: But what about anesthetic?
Plankton: There's no time! I can feel it digesting!
[Karen lifts her arm revealing that there is a saw attachment.]
Karen: Whatever you say, dear. Hold still. [The exterior of the Chum Bucket is shown] This may pinch a little.
[Plankton screams. The scene changes to shown SpongeBob looking out a Krusty Krab window at the Chum Bucket with a sign and a line of customers.]
SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What is it, lad?
SpongeBob: Take a look.
[The scene shows Plankton with a bandage on his stomach and holding a megaphone as a line enters the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: Keep it moving, nice and orderly. Hey, Eugene! You want a free Krabby Patty? Just guess how many customers I can fit into the Chum Bucket!
[Mr. Krabs gasps.]
Abigail Marge: I feel terrible! The Krabby Patty takes like stomach acid!
[She gags and runs off. Henry Bart leaves.]
Henry-Bart: Yeah, and it tastes like aspirin and carrots! [rubs tongue] Ugh! Get it off! Get it off!
[All of the customers scream and run away.]
Plankton: Wait, come back! Oh, come on, Karen, what happened?
Karen: I just did what you asked. [She lifts up a bag of Plankton's stomach contents.] I analyzed the contents of your stomach and used them to synthesize a [She lifts up a Krabby Patty that is messed up.] Krabby Patty.
[Mr. Krabs laughs.]
Mr. Krabs: It warms me heart to see that little twerp fail. Okay, boyo, fun time's over. [He hands SpongeBob a plunger.] Now go fish them buns out of the toilet. Oh, yeah, [He holds up bun seed jar.] and put these seeds back on 'em.
SpongeBob: That's my Krabs!
[SpongeBob laughs and the episode ends.]

French Narrator: Well, well, what is this? Ah, the artist at sea. Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck.
Artist: Hmm... ah! [He kisses his pencil, then he draws some more strokes. He hums something. He accidentally throws his pencil into the sea. It sinks in the water until it's out of sight]
Artist: My pencil! [searches for it in the sea] What? No, no!
French Narrator: The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: Always bring a spare pencil.
Artist: Noooooo! [with a loudly sound. Cut to the pencil dropping into the water. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with bubbles]
SpongeBob: Okay. Ready, Patrick? One...
Patrick: Two...
Both: Three!
[SpongeBob blows a scissors bubble and Patrick blows a paper bubble]
SpongeBob: Scissors beats paper, Patrick! [they both laugh at that] One...
Both: two...
SpongeBob: Three! [both blow paper bubbles] Patrick, how come you always do paper? [the pencil pops the two paper bubbles and drops in the sand and the two scream while running around. They both hide behind the Pineapple away from the pencil.]
Patrick: What is that thing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It looks like a giant pencil!
Patrick: Go touch it!
[SpongeBob extends his arm and touches the pencil]
SpongeBob: It is a giant pencil, Patrick! [SpongeBob grabs the pencil] Let's draw some giant pictures with it.
Patrick: Whatcha drawin'?
SpongeBob: Stand back, Patrick. I can't draw with you breathing down my neck.
Patrick: Psshh, artists.
SpongeBob: It's a jellyfish.
Patrick: Pretty good, SpongeBob, but it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired.
SpongeBob: Eh, everybody's a critic.
[The drawing comes to life and swims away buzzing]
Patrick: SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!
SpongeBob: Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic.
Patrick: No, I mean it's swimming away!
SpongeBob: Do you know what this means, Patrick?
Patrick: Your art can never hang in a museum.
SpongeBob: It means we found a magic pencil!
Patrick: Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Coming right up! [he draws mustache on Patrick's face]
Patrick: Life is good! [the mustache floats away. He shrugs] Easy come, easy go...
Squidward: Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea. You've got looks, talent, all you need is a full head of... [the mustache goes on his head] HAIR!
Patrick: My turn!
SpongeBob: Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such.
Patrick: Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.
SpongeBob: Okay! Why didn't you say so?
[Patrick draws a crudely-drawn picture of Squidward with a small stature and a waving fist.]
SpongeBob: Hey! Another jellyfish!
Patrick: It's Squidward, silly!
[The badly drawn Squidward comes to life and grumbles at them]
SpongeBob: It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.
Patrick: You're right, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: We can't let it go into town! [Patrick erases it]
Patrick: Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hey! My brain just hatched an idea. [he draws a dollar on Squidward's green mat, attached to a string while laughing] This is gonna be classic!
Squidward: [dressed up] I think I fancy a stroll around the park.
SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: [opens door] What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy! [SpongeBob pulls the string] Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair! [it floats away] SpongeBob!
[Squidward goes back inside and slams the door, Patrick and SpongeBob laugh while hopping up and down and suddenly stop]
SpongeBob: Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me! [SpongeBob draws a doodle of himself, Patrick laughs. The drawing stands up] Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie. [Draws it] Ready for action! 
[The SpongeBob doodle shouts nonsense and he runs over to Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Patrick: He's going to the door.
[DoodleBob knocks on the door]
SpongeBob: He's knockin' on the door. Squidward's answering the door... aaaaand...
[DoodleBob picks up Squidward, holding him upside-down and repeatedly pounds his head on the ground]
Squidward: OOH! OWW, OWW, OW!
Patrick: He's beating up Squidward! Ha! Ha! Ha!
[Patrick and SpongeBob watch DoodleBob slam Squidward back and forth]
SpongeBob: DoodleBoy, stop! [DoodleBob throws Squidward back in his house. Then he steals the magic pencil and then runs away with it]
Patrick: He's got the pencil.
SpongeBob: What have I done? We've got to find him!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick in a field with tall bushes] 
SpongeBob: Where could he possibly be?
Patrick: Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.
SpongeBob: Come on, let's go! [Patrick hides in a bush]
Patrick: I'm not going in there [SpongeBob also hides]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there... [DoodleBob draws a hole. They fall into it]
Patrick: What just happened?
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense] Meahoy, memoyay? Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!
Patrick: Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?
SpongeBob: No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him. [a giant wrench falls and hits Patrick on the head]
DoodleBob: Neofineyin!
SpongeBob: See what I mean, Patrick?
Patrick: [dizzily] WHERE'S THE LEAK, MA'AM? [DoodleBob draws a bowling ball and rolls it. Patrick's head turns into a bowling pin in surprise] Yurrgh! [Hits Patrick and some pink bowling pins and a "strike" symbol appears. Another "strike" symbol then appears after the bowling ball falls into the hole]
SpongeBob: You okay, Patrick?
Patrick: FINLAND!
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense and more nonsense] Meyaiovah! Mee hoy minoy! Meah froyay! [he runs off in the distance, Bubble transition to a coral rock wall and a field]
SpongeBob: There he is.
Patrick: He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie! [SpongeBob looks down at his own clothes]
SpongeBob: Uh... *ahem*.
Patrick: [blushes] Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob. Heh heh!
SpongeBob: He's putting down the pencil. This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him.
Patrick: Ooh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?
[DoodleBob breaks through the coral rock wall where SpongeBob and Patrick are hiding behind.]
DoodleBob: [nonsense] Bawahh bwah bwah wahh! [DoodleBob grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick!! Patrick! Do something!
Patrick: Happy Birthday!
[DoodleBob throws SpongeBob, who screams and lands with a thud in the distance]
Patrick: [Gives DoodleBob a rock] Here's your present. [DoodleBob bashes it on his head] You're welcome.
DoodleBob: [nonsense] Dewaaagheaugaaagh! [DoodleBob was about to run for his life until SpongeBob stops him whilst holding the pencil in his face]
SpongeBob: Hold it right there, Doodle! I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?
DoodleBob: [speaking nonsense fast] EEDAHFAAWAHOBABOBBA!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, what was that?
DoodleBob: [Slowing gibberish down] Ee...DAh...Faawa...HobaBobba... [DoodleBob starts to shout more gibberish while SpongeBob erases his face. DoodleBob mutters, then he hits a rock]
SpongeBob: Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good. [begins to erase DoodleBob to oblivion] Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...! [he screams in victory] I AM SPONGEBOB, DESTROYER OF EVIL!
Patrick: Take it easy. It's just a drawing.
SpongeBob: [calmly] Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?
Patrick: Done and done.
[When SpongeBob and Patrick go home, it is soon revealed that one of DoodleBob's arms is still alive. It creeps out from under the rock. Cut to nighttime. SpongeBob had just returned home. He draws on the spaces of his bedroom to make it look like a fancy bedroom, complete with a canopy for his bed.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince.
Gary: [with a crown on] Meeeoowww.
SpongeBob: Good night, magic pencil. [Falls asleep. DoodleBob's arm goes into SpongeBob's house, it starts going up the stairs and takes a bathroom break, finally he sneaks up to SpongeBob's bed, grabs the pencil, and starts to re-draw himself. He wakes up] Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water? [laughs] [DoodleBob pops up in his bed] AAAAH! DOODLEBOB! Heh heh, no hard feelings, right? [DoodleBob draws two angry eyebrows on his face and jumps on SpongeBob's bed holding the pencil threateningly] [screams] What do you think you're doing, doodle?!
DoodleBob: You Doodle! Me SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams and jump out of the ways as DoodleBob erases his pillow, then part of SpongeBob's house whilst chasing him, they chase downstairs. DoodleBob erases a door and the back of SpongeBob's pants, revealing his butt] Huh? [Erases his butt]
SpongeBob: [screams] Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen? [DoodleBob erases his nose] I nose. [DoodleBob erases some parts of his face and body, DoodleBob laughs at the way he looks now] Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn. [When SpongeBob and DoodleBob struggle, the pencil breaks into two. SpongeBob has the lead and draws the rest of his face and body back] Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw. [DoodleBob sharpens the pencil with his mouth. He now has both sides] You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school. [the lead piece flies out of his hand, crashes through the window and hits Squidward]
Squidward: [offscreen] Ow! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!
SpongeBob: Or maybe it was most clumsy. [DoodleBob starts to attack him again as SpongeBob hides in a bookshelf, as DoodleBob approaches him, he gets his foot stuck in a piece of paper on the floor, DoodleBob sees this and tries to get it off] Huh? [SpongeBob looks in a book] Paper! [DoodleBob tosses the pencil from his hand] Page for Mr. Doodle! [Smashes him with a notebook. SpongeBob watches as DoodleBob is preserved as a drawing, when it was all over, he smiles. The next day, SpongeBob hangs the piece of paper on the wall with a push-pin]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?
SpongeBob: Take a look for yourself, Patrick.
Patrick: [Gasp!] It's the evil Doodle!
SpongeBob: No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose. [he blows from a pipe]
Patrick: So... he's a drawing?
SpongeBob: Exactly! See how happy he is?
Patrick: [He looks at the paper with DoodleBob on it] He still looks kind of creepy.
[Cut to outside. SpongeBob has just drawn a diving board. The pencil's broken halves have recently been taped together.]
SpongeBob: Oh, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?
Patrick: Ready! [SpongeBob drops the pencil into Patrick's mouth. SpongeBob jumps from the diving board and onto Patrick's chest, and the pencil is launched back to the surface. In the real world, the artist from earlier is curled up in a fetal position]
French Narrator: We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.
Artist: [the pencil reaches the surface and lands on him] Huh? What's this? [he jumps up and holds his pencil in joy] My pencil! [he tries to draw, but unfortunately, the pencil lead breaks]
French Narrator: [As the artist starts to cry] The second most important rule for the artist at sea: Always bring a pencil sharpener.
Artist: NOOOOO!!!



[Plankton laughs, squirts out chum onto a plate, smells the chum and laughs again. Karen comes out of the door.]
Karen: What do I owe the excessive volume of this giggling?
Plankton: You may thank my new and original idea, darling. [Karen is confused] Free samples! [Karen is still confused]
Karen: New and original, my exhaust fan.
Plankton: Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!
Karen: You mean the smell?  [Karen starts laughing] Smell.
Plankton: No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free! [scene cuts in Chum Bucket, Plankton is sitting on a bench near the store with free samples] Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!
Nat: Hey, what did he just say it was?
Plankton: I just said they're free!
Nat: Oh... I thought he said freaks. In that case... [everyone goes in line] So glad I actually left my house today.
[everyone gets some chum]
Plankton: That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole putting Krabs out of business. Business.
Sally: What is it?
Shubie: Oh, who cares silly-big-milly? It's free!
Sally: Oh, it's going to be so good cause it's free!
[everyone starts putting the chum in their mouths then gets surprised]
Plankton: Eat up. [Plankton laughs, and Shubie holds her stomach, Nancy and Frank turn green, Nancy's hair stands on end, everyone is nauseous] I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger. [Plankton runs]
Nat: Hey, he's making a run for it! We can't let him get away with this! Let's get up and... [Nat is nauseous again, and he speaks in a deep voice] get him.
[everyone, still sick, chases Plankton. Patrick comes up to the stand]
Patrick: "Free samples". [Patrick eats one of the chum and enjoys it] Yum! [Patrick eats more chum]
[everyone is by the Chum Bucket. Lifeguard pounds on the door]
Frank: Hey, you!, I know you're in there!
Plankton: It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!
Karen: If Krabs gave away free samples, he probably won't poison people thus tarnishing the good name of his restaurant.
Plankton: Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen. [Plankton gets an idea] Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!
Harold: Free Krabby Patties?!
[everyone runs to the stand again]
Nat: Hey, what's all the hubble?
Nazz: Oh, didn't ya hear? Someone's giving away free Krabby Patties!
Plankton: That's it. [laughs]
Frank: Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you the same guy who was giving away those rotten chum samples before?
Plankton: [sweats nervously] Oh, that wasn't me that was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton.
Lifeguard: Oh, okay.
[everyone eats the chum, Frank's eyes pop out and his arms fall out, everyone else falls on Frank. Plankton comes out of the sewer]
Plankton: Krabby Patties, anyone?
[other people eat the chum, as a fish hurls]
SpongeBob: [singing] I'm off to work, off to work, getting ready for flipping. [SpongeBob sees people by the Krusty Krab] Those customers can't get enough Krabby Patties. Settle down folks: I'm here; I shall have your Krabby Patties before you shortly.
Nat: You!
Frank: You made those awful Krabby Patties what made my eyeballs fall out!
[SpongeBob gets scared and slides into the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Over here boy. [Mr. Krabs is hiding by the table]
SpongeBob: What is going on out there?
Mr. Krabs: The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why. [Lifeguard throws a brick with a note through the window] "Because the Krabby Patty is terrible". [gasps] Krabby Patty? Terrible? How do those words even go together?
SpongeBob: I don't know, but we have do something to turn this situation around.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if you want to get customers in here, shouldn't we lower the prices?
Mr. Krabs: Fine. [Mr. Krabs lowers the price from $2.99 to $2.98] How about that? [one of the customers throws rocks] I'm ruined! [Mr. Krabs starts crying]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if you want your customers back, we're gonna need to take more extreme measures.
Mr. Krabs: I'm all ears.
SpongeBob: We simply give Krabby Patties away for fr- [Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob's lips]
Mr. Krabs: Don't you say it, boy!
SpongeBob: It's the only way, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob is holding a stand] Alright, sir, it's time.
Mr. Krabs: Time? But it's too soon. [Mr. Krabs jumps to the stand] I'm not ready to let them go free.
SpongeBob: But you said to go ahead with the plan no matter how hard you fight me.
Mr. Krabs: I don't remember saying anything like that.
SpongeBob: I do. [SpongeBob pulls the sheet off, Mr. Krabs screams] Free Krabby Patties! Get your totally and completely free upcharge Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: No! [Mr. Krabs tries to run but his claws are in chains]
SpongeBob: It's for your own good, Eugene. Free Krabby Patties, come and get your free Krabby Patties! [the word "patties" echoes]
Mr. Krabs: Whew, uh, for a second. I thought we have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like free ain't even enough to jump start me business. Wait, free ain't even enough? Me business is doomed! [starts crying again]
Plankton: I can't really believe how well this is turning out for me today! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Hmm, looks, it's time to pull out the big guns. [SpongeBob opens the small doors and plays the calliope] No one can resist the sweet sounds of a calliope.
Shubie: Hey look, Billy, a calliope.
SpongeBob: Squidward, here's your cup like we rehearsed.
Squidward: I can't feel my legs.
SpongeBob: Here let me help you, Squidward.
 [SpongeBob pulls Squidward's nose, Squidward goes in front of Billy]
Baby Billy: Look, mama, a monkey! [Billy throws a penny at Squidward] Dance, monkey, dance! Dance, monkey!
[Squidward takes off his suit and gives it to Baby Billy]
Squidward: I quit!
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward, don't leave! We can't give up yet!
[Plankton laughs]
Plankton: Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!
[SpongeBob pulls up Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, we'll fix this.
Mr. Krabs: Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab, it's probably best if you start looking forward for a new job, boy, maybe in the different way like.
SpongeBob: New... Different... [SpongeBob gets an idea] That's it!
Mr. Krabs: Well, that was better than I expected. Well only one more thing left to do now. I have to leave back with me ma. Hopefully she kept me posters in me room.
Narrator: Five minutes later.
SpongeBob: Krabby Patties, brand new Krabby Patty recipe, all new, all different, all deliciousness, try them for free!
Nazz: You can't be serious.
Frank: I'm so hungry, I don't care, I gotta eat something.
Nazz: No! Wait!
Nat: Let him go, it's too late.
SpongeBob: All new free Krabby Patties!
Frank: Hey, buddy, I'll try one, what do I got to lose. [everyone gasps, Frank eats half of the Krabby Patty] Dear Neptune Gill Sacks, this is the best thing I every put in my mouth! Yay! [Frank's shirt turns pink then normal]
Nazz: Did he just say it was good?
[Frank finishes the other half of the Krabby Patty]
Frank: Woohoo! [Frank dances] 
Nat: Wow, Frank never dances, it must be good!
[everyone eats the Krabby Patties, Henry-Bart's eyes turn into a thumbs up, money comes out of his skin]
Henry-Bart: I'm getting something this amazing for free! How much will this buy? [Henry-Bart throws money on SpongeBob]
Frank: Yum yum! Yum yum yum yum! Yum yum! [Frank goes like a rocket] Hey, patty boy, take my wallet, I gotta have more! [Frank goes in the stand and takes two Krabby Patties]
[Nat and the Fish's heads turn into arms and give a high-five]
Nat and Nazz: Now that's what I'm talking about!
[Nat and Nazz's head turn back to normal, they get a briefcase from their pockets]
Nat: Here's our life savings! Just give us more Krabby Patties! [Nat and Nazz dump the money on SpongeBob]
[Plankton with a cellphone]
Plankton: Don't worry, Karen, I'll be here at lunch time. My mission here is accomplished. [laughs, and then a dollar bill lands on Plankton] What the...?! [gasps]
SpongeBob: It's working!
Plankton: No, wait! What's going on? You hate Krabby Patties remember? [a dump trunk dumps money] Uh-oh. [the money lands on Plankton] 
[a helicopter dumps a bag full of money on SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs is just walking and then a dollar lands on his nose. His eyes pop out and he screams so loudly, Plankton comes out of the money, and Mr. Krabs jumps on the money and laughs]
SpongeBob: We did it, Mr. Krabs! We saved the Krusty Krab! All I did was sell the old Krabby Patties, and call them new!
Mr. Krabs: Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here.
SpongeBob: Oh, money angels, can I make one?
Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in! [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh. Plankton screams because Mr. Krabs is sitting on him] Did you hear what?
SpongeBob: Hear what?
Mr. Krabs: Good point. [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue laughing]


[pan over live-action houses]
French Narrator: We take you now to Encino, California, where we find the President of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.. flipping burgers?!
Patchy: Hey, kids! Potty and I took jobs flipping burgers so we could be just like our hero...SpongeBob SquarePants!
Potty: I took the job for the free sodas.
Patchy: Potty, don't you have dishes to wash?
Mr. Pirateson: Argh!
Patchy: Oh, hey, kids! Say hello to my boss, Mr. Pirateson.
Mr. Pirateson: Arrrrrrrrrgh! [gives Patchy a piece of paper]
Patchy: [Reads] One order of Scurvy Fries, one large Bilge Water.
Mr. Pirateson: Argh! Arrrgh!
Patchy: Uh, Diet Bilge Water. I'll get right on it sir. [Patchy salutes, his spatula (which replaces his hook) impacting his forehead. He squirms in pain] Ahhhhh!
[Cut to next scene]
Potty: P.U.! What died in there?
Patchy: Oh, Potty, you're just in time to see me new Pirate Patties! I call this one "Buried Treasure". [reveals a treasure chest on a hamburger]
Potty: Where'd you dig that one up?
Patchy: I call this one "Walk the Plank". [reveals a wooden board on a hamburger]
Potty: I'm already "board" with that one.
Patchy: This'll blow out your old bird brain of yours. Behold! The "Patchy Patty"! [reveals a patty on a burger with a pickle for an eye, an eye patch, a mustard mouth, a beard around the patty, and lettuce underneath.]
Patchy Patty: Ahoy!
Potty: Aw, that's the worst one yet.
Patchy: Potty Parrot, you are never supportive of me! I don't wanna be your friend anymore! I never wanna see you again!
Potty: Brawk, Patchy, no! [Patchy cries and runs to another room] Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Brawk! Squawk!
Patchy: You know, this isn't the first time that a patty's come between two good chums. It happened once in Bikini Bottom. Here, take a look while I...[sniffs]...pull myself together. [continues crying. Episode starts]
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, something ain't right. 
[A two-tiered pink birthday cake on a cart rolls in. The icing reads "Happy Birthday Krabs"]
Mr. Krabs: For me?
Squidward: Don't you find this a tad suspicious?
Mr. Krabs: Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing. 
[Mr. Krabs is about to blow out the candle when Plankton pops out from underneath the candle]
Plankton: Surprise!
[SpongeBob and Squidward scream. Plankton, smiling deviously, takes out the candle and uses it to release the balloons. Like dynamite, the balloon strings burn up and the balloons pop as confetti goes everywhere. The light from the popping blinds the customers as confetti gets into their eyes. Plankton's cart engages in its jet pack and launches itself into the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Duck!
Plankton: Disengage!
[Plankton releases the bottom part of the cake onto the safe in the kitchen. Plankton lands the upper cake part onto the floor and hits a button on the control panel. The cake explodes, causing icing to go onto SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs and Squidward's faces. Plankton takes the formula and flies out of the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Me secret formula!
Plankton: Happy Birthday, Krabs!
SpongeBob: Don't forget your condiments, Plankton. [squirts Plankton's ship on the windshield with ketchup and mustard]
Mr. Krabs: Attaboy, SpongeBob! [turns the ceiling fan on. Plankton's machine bounces off of it and breaks to pieces on the floor. SpongeBob snatches the secret formula with his tongue and swallows it]
SpongeBob: Safe!
Plankton: You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back. [activates his jet pack, but he realizes it's upside down] Oh, barnacles. [He flies into the floor. Everyone is groaning and moaning from the ordeal.]
SpongeBob: Why, Mr. Krabs? Why does he hate us so?! [cries]
Mr. Krabs: Well, you might as well blame me, SpongeBob. [sits on a barrel seat] There was a time when Plankton and I...were...best friends. [everyone gasps and runs up to hear the story]
SpongeBob: Best friends?
Mr. Krabs: Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones...
[Mr. Krabs began to recall himself and Plankton as babies, which was the time they were born.]
Baby Plankton: Goo. [Baby Krabs laughs, then he puts Plankton on the mobile hanging above him.]
Everyone: Aw!
[Cut to flashback of Krabs and Plankton's third birthday. There's a birthday cake reading "Big Boys". Toddler Krabs inhales, then sticks out his tongue to get Plankton to blow out the candles]
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating]...things were all peaches and cream... [Plankton blows out the candles, then dives off his tongue into the cake as if jumping off a diving board into a swimming pool. Bubble transition to elementary school, after passing years]...until we hit grade school.
[In a classroom, kids are in science class, chattering and doing chemistry as the teacher reads at his desk. Krabs, as a kid, is writing on paper as Plankton, also a kid, holds up two test tubes in his gloved hands.]
Young Eugene: Hey, Planky. What'cha doing?
Kid Plankton: Oh, just a little something I thought I'd try out. [a spitball hits Plankton in the back of his head. The classmates laugh] Idiots! I'll show you with science! This concoction is going to blow everyone away. [muffled explosion. Plankton's container blows up all over his table and covers him in ashes. Classmates laugh. Billy, the ringleader of the hooligans, grabs him]
Billy: How's this for a science experiment, Mr. Brainatron 5000? [He stuffs Plankton into his straw and blows him out like a spitball. He splatters into Mr. Krabs's eye.]
Kid Plankton: [moaning in pain] They'll pay for this one day, Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: [peeling off squished Plankton] Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.
Billy: [feigning guilt] You're right, Plankton, I'm sorry. [back to mean and cruel bully mode] Sorry you have to hang out with Rag Boy. [bullies laugh]
Classmate #2: Yeah. Where'd you do your clothes shopping, the trash can? [the class laughs again. Krabs is on the verge of breaking down into tears.]
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating] 'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash. [flashback ends] You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to.... [sniffles]....fashion me clothes from rags.
[flashback to Krabs' mother sewing up clothes]
Mama Krabs: There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.
Old Man Jenkins: Oops. [rips off Mr. Krabs' clothes and uses it as a rag to dry his boat] I missed a spot.
[Krabs and Plankton are walking through the carnival grounds, with Plankton conversing with him. Krabs has a box around his body]
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating] Then one day, as Plankton and I plotted our revenge, I met the love of me life.
Kid Mr. Krabs: What in Neptune's name is that? [picks up a penny off the ground] It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen! What is it?!
Kid Plankton: It's money.
Mr. Krabs: Moneyyyyyyyyyy?
Plankton: Yeah. You can buy things with it.
Kid Mr. Krabs: Buy things?
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating] So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton. [Mr. Krabs buys a balloon for Plankton, but when he gives it to Plankton, he flies up into the sky because of his weight. Krabs reaches up, looking desperate]
All: Wow!
SpongeBob: Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea what that went through to get here.
Mr. Krabs: I've got a pretty good idea, yeah. [shoves it away with a pencil]
SWAT Fish #4: So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?
Squidward: Yeah. I really wanna know.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called "Stinky Burgers". It was the only place to get a burger. The kids loved Stinky. [a group of kid regulars (Billy and his gang) run up clamoring] And Stinky loved the kids.
Stinky: Now, what can I do for you, young 'uns?
Billy: Uh, Mr. Stinky? I'll have one burger, please!
Bully #3: Me, too, Stinky!
Stinky: Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone. [they all cheer]
Big Johnny: That's why we like you so much, Stinky. You always deliver the goods.
Bully #5: We don't like Stinky, we respect him.
Stinky: Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like or respect me?
Big Johnny: Like!
Bully #5: Respect!
Big Johnny: Like!
Bully #5: Respect!
Stinky: Okay, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me. [they cheer again]
Mr. Krabs: Excuse us!
Plankton: Valuable customers coming through.
Big Johnny (in Billy's voice): What are those dorks doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Two Stinky Burgers, please.
Stinky: [Stinky makes weird faces] Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.
All: Yeah, Stinky!
Billy: Thanks for keeping the nerds out.
Bully #2: You're the best, Stinky.
Stinky: Okay, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy. [Mr. Krabs is knocking on the door in the back of the building. Stinky opens up the door, he makes weird faces again] Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li... [his watch beeps] Is it quitting time already? [rips off his clothes to reveal some nicer clothes underneath] Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials. [gets in his limo and moves the stack of cash over on the seat. As he closes the door and drives off, a dollar flies into Mr. Krabs' hand]
Plankton: Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipping burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.
Mr. Krabs: Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if someone made a better burger, they'd have a fatter stack of loot. [cash register dings as Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into dollar bill signs] But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?
Plankton: Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school! [laughs. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: I miss Potty. I remember the first time we met. [Patchy shows a picture of him as a young pirate, holding Potty's egg in his hands] If I could only hear his voice.
Potty: Less talking and more working.
Patchy: [gasps] Potty! You came back to apologize!
Potty: I came to tell you to get back to work!
Patchy: Hey, you can't tell me what to do you... Huh? Assistant manager? How did you become assistant manager?
Potty: Oh, a little thing called the G.E.D., my man.
Patchy: Oh, here we go again with the fancy book-learnin'. Customers love me cookin'. Why, we're almost out of doggie bags.
[Customer throws up the food into a doggy bag and the customer's face turns green]
Patchy: Oh, Potty, what am I doing wrong?
Potty: You just need some practice, that's all.
[Patchy flips burgers and stuff, then we see Patchy looking through a microscope. He sees mini burger bacteria cells, then he laughs and coughs]
Patchy: Ahh, me patty's done.
Potty: Smells like an unswabbed poop deck!
Patchy: Oh, fine. I'll eat it! [Patchy eats it and then smiles, frowns and spits it out] Oh, for the crime of befouling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank! [Patchy watches as the burger on a string jumps of the plank into the trash] Ah. Oh, well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either.
Potty: Brawk, roll film. [SpongeBob is shown as a baby and he makes a Krabby Patty perfectly] A perfect patty on the first try.
Patchy: Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!
Potty: You're unsanitary, Patchy. You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!
Patchy: Well, that's what gives it its special flavor. [Patchy puts a small piece of hamburger meat on top and sparkles]
Potty: You've got rats in the kitchen!
Patchy: Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily. Who's Patchy's little princess? [Rat bites him] Ow! Mmmm! Don't do that!
Potty: And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom.
Patchy: What? Every time?
Potty: That's not all! This is a step in the right direction.
Patchy: What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?
Potty: The same kind who wears a "Kiss the Cook" apron.
Patchy: Well, you'll never know, Potty. I might get lucky. You hear that, ladies? Patchy's available. Huh? [Patchy winks four times]
Potty: Now I feel sick.
Patchy: That's it, you feathered snake! This time you gone too far!
[Patchy starts flipping patties at Potty]
Potty: Brawk, you missed! Squawk! Is that all you got?
[when Potty flies away, Patchy flips one in Mr. Pirateson's face]
Potty: Now you've done it.
Mr. Pirateson: [He removes the patty from his face] Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
Patchy: Yes, Mr. Pirateson. [Potty flies into his office] You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired.
Mr. Pirateson: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
Patchy: Coming, Mr. Pirateson, sir.
[cut to Mr. Krabs and Plankton walking by the dump]
Mr. Krabs: So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress. [Mr. Krabs and Plankton work together to make a burger and go through the steps of doing so]
Plankton: Gently. Gently. [holds up the burger on a platter]
Mr. Krabs: We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kids' greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant. [Mr. Krabs and Plankton turn a trailer in the dump into a restaurant. Mr. Krabs cuts the 'grand opening' tape while Plankton pushes a button to signal for customers. A line of customers line up in front of the restaurant] Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please. [the kid gives his dollar for a burger]
Plankton: There you are, sir.
Mr. Krabs: 'Twas me first dollar I ever earned, and 'twas also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.
Fish Kid: Hey! Your burgers are even worse than Stinky's. We can barely keep them down. And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here. So give me a burger. I'm starving.
Plankton: Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.
Mr. Krabs: I thought it was our recipe.
Plankton: I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: But what about satisfying the customer?
Plankton: Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world! [laughs again] And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Mr. Krabs: Give me that!
Plankton: Stop! You're gonna bust it! [the recipe tears in half]
Mr. Krabs: Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!
Plankton: I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?
Mr. Krabs: Which one? The one that says "Eject" or the one that says "Trap Door"?
Plankton: Oh, either one will do.
Mr. Krabs: What I was saying was... [Plankton pulls a string that launches Mr. Krabs out of the restaurant] YOU'LL REGRET THIS ONE DAY!! [Mr. Krabs lands in the trash. Back to present] And he always did.
Plankton: [pops out of the pepper shaker] Lies! [SpongeBob is about to swallow the formula again, but Mr Krabs takes it and puts it in his back pocket]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.
Plankton: Very touching, but completely false.
Mr. Krabs: Don't know what you mean.
Plankton: Why don't you tell them the truth?
SpongeBob: It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?
Plankton: Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory. [flashback again to restaurant. Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: First, I'll rule their stomachs and then... [laughs] ...their money! [Mr. Krabs laughs]
Plankton: But what about satisfying the customers?
Mr. Krabs: Barnacles to the customers! [Plankton gasps] I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Plankton: Gimme that! [both try to take the formula]
Mr. Krabs: Stop, you're gonna bust it. [formula tears in half]
Plankton: This isn't about money, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: Malarkey. [Mr. Krabs puts Plankton in a straw and spits him out]
Plankton: YOU'LL REGRET THIS ONE DAY!! [lands in a pile of trash] Ouch. [emerges and looks at the half of his recipe] [offscreen, narrating] Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.
SpongeBob: Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.
Karen: That's because it isn't.
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, &amp; Plankton: KAREN?!
Karen: You're both liars. That's not how it happened at all. In those days, I was just starting out as a security system. Plankton and I met when he installed me.
Plankton: It was only our third date.
Karen: Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks. [flashback on Karen's computer screen]
Plankton: Now that's a handsome looking burger.
Mr. Krabs: You said it, old chum. [over intercom] Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here! [a tumbleweed rolls by] Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump? [music is playing in the background]
Plankton: What's that music?
Mr. Krabs: I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins! [Old Man Jenkins puts a tire in his boat]
Old Man Jenkins: I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.
Mr. Krabs: You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.
Old Man Jenkins: Why, I'd be happy to! [bites into the burger then smiles]
Mr. Krabs &amp; Plankton: Yeah! [Old Man Jenkins falls over. Later, a newspaper appears on screen]
Mr. Krabs: "Plab Patties KO Old Man J". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.
Plankton: Well, he is old.
Mr. Krabs: Hey. That guy is like family to me.
Plankton: Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.
Mr. Krabs: You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger. (The Subtitles in Netflix reads "You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in".)
Plankton: You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.
Mr. Krabs: No way, that recipe's mine! [both fight over the recipe]
Plankton: Stop, you're gonna... [recipe tears in half, sending both into opposite sides of the restaurant. Plankton walks out] You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget! [slams the door, causing a shelf above the boiling patty meat to spill the jars into the cauldron]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything. [licks some of the patty mix] I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.
Karen: [offscreen, narrating] Meanwhile, Plankton was back at the elementary school. But this time, he was going it alone. [Plankton puts a Chum Bucket bucket with meat in it while Mr. Krabs wheels in "Krabby Patties" and knocks him over]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.
Plankton: I think not, Rag Boy!
Mr. Krabs: What?! Why I oughta squash you right now! You little...
Plankton: Get out of my face! [both growl at each other]
Bully #3: Hey, look! Nerd fight.
Billy: I bet five bucks on Rag Boy.
Plankton: Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.
Billy: Big Johnny will eat anything. [Big Johnny walks over to Plankton's side]
Plankton: Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir. [Johnny eats it]
Karen: [offscreen, narrating] Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science.
Plankton: Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think! [Big Johnny spits the burger out on both his friends]
Billy: I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers.
Mr. Krabs: Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty. [hands him a patty. He takes a bite and instantly enjoys it]
Billy: Flavor!
Bully #5: Edible!
Bullies #2 and #6: We can actually hold it down!
Abigail-Marge: This is the most flavortastic sensation my still-developing taste buds have ever experienced!
All: Yay, Rag Boy!
Plankton: I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop till I do! [flashback ends]
Mr. Krabs: Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best!
Plankton: You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me!
Mr. Krabs: You callin' me a liar?
Karen: Will you men stop yelling at each other? I can't believe you let a recipe ruin such a wonderful friendship! [both tear up]
Mr. Krabs: You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.
Plankton: My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.
Mr. Krabs: Really?
Plankton: It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?
Mr. Krabs: I'd like that, Planky, old chum. [both hug and cry]
SpongeBob: Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?
Karen: I suppose it would. If I had one.
Plankton: I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.
Mr. Krabs: Me, too. Me, too. [Plankton grabs the formula from Mr. Krabs' back pocket]
Plankton: Now, Karen! [Karen grabs the formula] Back off, Rag Boy! [jumps on the formula and Karen wheels off]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Sabotage!
Plankton: Go, Karen! [everyone chases each other outside. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Ohh, that Plankton never learns, does he, kids? As for me, I decided to take some time off to catch up on me reading. [He holds up a newspaper that reads the word JOBS on the front]
Potty: Hey, you didn't take time off, you got fired!
Patchy: Hey, you got fired, too!
Potty: I got a golden parachute.
[A golden parachute appears on Potty's strings. The inside of the restaurant glows]
Patchy: Well, at least I know they'll never ever be able to replace me.
Potty: [squawk] Looks like they already did.
[Patchy gasps when he sees a gorilla]
Patchy: What!? They let a smelly, hairy fleabag like that serve food?
Gorilla: [enraged] Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh!
Patchy: Hey, watch it, ape!
[Gorilla throws some food ingredients at Patchy]
Patchy: Watch the patch! Ow! Ow! No! Please!
Gorilla: Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh...!
Patchy: Ooh! I have a tomato allergy! Ow, right in the buns!
Narrator: And so, kids, always remember to follow your dreams. Unless you're Patchy, then just stay in bed.

SpongeBob: Hi Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I just been turned into lunchmeat by me own worms! [cuts to furious worms, chasing for him]
SpongeBob: Aaaaa! Hop in, sir! We'll get you out of here!
Mr. Krabs: [quickly rushes into sleigh] Much appreciate it, boy! [sleigh takes off, worms keep chasing]
Everyone except Squidward: Faster! Faster! Faster!
Gary: Mooowww... [tries to go faster]
Everyone: Faster! Faster!
[cuts back and forth between Mr. Krabs' worms and Gary]
Everyone: Faster! [Gary runs in a dead end and stops, tired]
SpongeBob: This is a dead end! [Gary turns around to see the worms entering the dead end]
Everyone: [screaming]
Gary: [like a lion] Rooooooooarr! [after worms run away scared, Gary turns back to normal] Meow. [Everyone stares at Gary for a few seconds, then cheers]
[cheering causes snow at the only road out the dead end collapses and covers the exit]
Mr. Krabs: Great. Now we're trapped.
[cuts to everyone around a fire, made with SpongeBob's hat, but still shivering.
Mr. Krabs: Good thinkin', squirrel! This should keep us alive for at least... a few hours... oh...
Patrick: [shivers] It's-s-s... so c-c-cold!
[SpongeBob's nose with ice on it breaks off, and the ice on Patrick's eyelids shatter off. Gary get so cold he gets into his shell, and apparently he has a warm room with furniture in his shell, he sips his drink. Mr. Krabs' lips shatter off.]
SpongeBob: Hey! How about a campfire song? [Squidward thaws]
Squidward: No Singing!
Everyone: Squidward! [hugs him]
Squidward: [pushes them back] Alright, alright! Someone get me a blanket. [SpongeBob gives him a blanket, Squidward puts it on but still feels cold]
Mr. Krabs: Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?
Squidward: [looks down] Huh? This isn't mine... [foot lifts up] Waaaahhh! [runs]
[Snow Mollusk breaks through snow]
All: [screaming]
[Snow Mollusk roars]
Mr. Krabs: Not you again!
[Snow Mollusk sticks out five tongues from mouth]
Sandy: Ha! Slimey snow vermin! You missed!
Mr. Krabs: That's weren't the attack.
Sandy: Huh?
[Snow Mollusk pulls back tongues with snow on them]
Mr. Krabs: Hit the deck! [Snow Mollusk starts shooting snowballs out of mouth; Mr. Krabs screams and hides behind a pile of snow, blocking the snowballs, Snow Mollusk aims for Gary]
SpongeBob: Gary! [shields Gary with himself, the snowballs go into SpongeBob's holes, and they come out from the side holes. SpongeBob stands up and runs away with Gary. The Snow Mollusk aims for Squidward]
Squidward: [running and screams; jumps into water] Oh no... not again... [floats up in a block of ice again, but with a disappointed face]
Mr. Krabs: She's reloading! Now's our chance to scram. [everyone sneaks away, Sandy brings the sleigh]
SpongeBob: What is that formidable creature?
Mr. Krabs: That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk.
SpongeBob: [shocked]I thought that was just a myth.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I assure you, she's no myth! She's as real as Santy Claus. Twas back when I was young sea captain, [flashback to when Mr. Krabs was a captain] sailing in the Atlantic sea. When the behemith and i first tangled. [Snow Mollusk pops out of sea, young Mr. Krabs gasps, and Snow Mollusk picks up the ship]
SpongeBob: Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled back those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!
Mr. Krabs: Nope, that didn't work. [flashback continues] She gulped me and me crew down in one swift swallow. [Snow Mollusk swallows all people on ship including Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Oh my! Well, at least you bravely escaped to tell the tale.
Mr. Krabs: Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course. [flashback to people in Snow Mollusk's stomach, a bubble floats up and pops, then a flushing sound is heard]
SpongeBob: Hm?[realizing what this really means] Oh! Ew.
Sandy: I'd hate to break up story time, but I'd like to NOT GET EATEN today! [Snow Mollusk's roaring is heard, and everyone gets on sleigh, Snow Mollusk finds them, they leave]
SpongeBob: Gary! Step on it! [Snow Mollusk follows] Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys? [cuts to back of sleigh, and one of the seats are empty with a "Squidward" sign in its place] We forgot Squidward! [sleigh takes a U-turn, and goes between the Snow Mollusk's tentacles] Left, Gary! Left! There he is!
[cuts to Squidward, frozen]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I need a Gooey Worm!
Patrick: Oh, be gentle, it's my last one! [hands SpongeBob a red Gooey Worm]
SpongeBob: Hold on tight! [gives Patrick one end of the Gooey Worm and glides down holding the other one]
Gary: Meow. [as SpongeBob is saving Squidward, the Snow Mollusk finds him]
Patrick: SpongeBob! Come on! [cuts to SpongeBob on Squidward, with Gooey Worm tied on ice block] Let's get outta here! [pulls SpongeBob up, and Snow Mollusk lands on the water. When they are leaving, SpongeBob throws away the Gooey Worm, and falls into Snow Mollusk's mouth when she's getting up, she likes it]
Sandy: Woo, wee! That was a close one, wasn't it, Mr. Krabs? Huh? [in Mr. Krabs' seat, there is a pile of snow with coral as a nose and eyes] Of all the horn swabbles! The banit's trying to weigh us down and make with the prize himself! [throws fake Mr. Krabs out of the sleigh]
[cuts to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Argh argh argh! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish than share me winnings with y-- [jellyfish flies into Mr. Krabs' mouth and stings him.]
[cuts back to others]
Sandy: We can't let that double crosser beat us to the loot! Full speed ahead and don't stop for nothin', Gary!
Patrick: Hey! [takes rope and stops Gary, making the sleigh fling Sandy out]
Sandy: [in snow] What's the big emergency, Patrick?
Patrick: I saw something shiny.
Sandy: [sarcastic] Oh! Well, let's just drop everything, then!
SpongeBob: Oh, wait, Sandy, I see it too! It looks like... Karen.
SpongeBob: [helps Karen up] Karen?
[Karen's screen shows a spinning hourglass]
Sandy: I say she's in swift need of a reboot! Heee ya! [kicks Karen with her boot, shattering the ice on her]
[Karen's screen shows a picture of a computer wife with words "Computer WIFE [progress bar] Loading..." beside it, and soon starts up.]
SpongeBob: [hears someone saying "you can't stand a chance, Krabs"] Huh? [sees fake Plankton and picks it up] Plankton? [fake Plankton says "don't tell Krabs"] Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him.
Patrick: [grabs fake Plankton] Well we gotta bust him out but quick! I'm gonna sit on him! [puts fake Plankton on a rock, preparing to sit on it]
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! He's very--[Patrick sits on fake Plankton]...fragile. [Patrick gets up, showing bits of metal with wires, a speaker, and an eye, broken, it says "Krabs zzz... stand zzz..."]
Sandy: A simulacrum!
SpongeBob: [covers Gary's "ears"] Sandy please! Language!
Sandy: Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!
Karen: That's right. My selfish husband remains in warm, sunny Bikini Bottom, while I freeze my solder off in this bitter tundra. In fact, [cuts to Plankton with fake Plankton and Karen in his lab] this whole race was a plot devised by Plankton. [cuts to Plankton sneaking away before the race] With the entire town distracted, he's free to pursue the Krabby Patty formula undetected.
SpongeBob: Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!
Sandy: And exactly how do you propose we find him?
Karen: I saw Mr. Krabs pass by [screen shows Mr. Krabs running] just before my system failed, heading southwest.
SpongeBob: Well, what are we waiting for? [picks Karen, Sandy, Patrick up and throws them into the sleigh, and gets in himself] You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Mush! Mush!
[cuts to Plankton]
Plankton: [sprays safe with flamethrower] Hehehehe! [touches handle, which is glowing red due to extreme heat] Yeuch! [blows hand] So the safe isn't vulnerable to flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more destructive! [accidentally takes out teddy bear, then puts it back] Ahem! I meant destructive! [takes out a stick of dynamite]
[cuts to SpongeBob and others, going up a steep hill]
Gary: [tired] Mooowww, meow meow meow moooww...
SpongeBob: Attaboy, Gary!
[sleigh gets to the tip of the hill, Gary sees a huge ramp below, screeches and gets in the sleigh.]
All: Ahhhh!
[sleigh goes down the ramp, flies into the air, turns a circle, bounces on three hill tops, and back on the road]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Ahh, whew.
Sandy: Cliff! [cliff ahead]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [both scream]
Sandy: Hold on, SpongeBob! [picks up SpongeBob and throws him on another hill's tip, the sleigh goes in a circle with SpongeBob as the turning point, but Squidward, still frozen, flys off in the progress]
SpongeBob: [with bruises on face, missing teeth and extra long legs and arms] We made it! Hooray! Right, Squidward? [cuts to Squidward falling down]
Sandy: Gasp! Oh, my gosh! Patrick! Lean to the other side! [Patrick turns, and the sleigh goes down following Squidward] Excuse me, ma'am.
Karen: What?
[Sandy pulls off Karen's monitor, stands on SpongeBob, and uses the base's pole and sticks it into the block of ice Squidward is in, and pulls him in]
Sandy: Gotcha!
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, have you given any thoughts on how we're gonna--[sleigh crashes to the ground, making everyone flat]...land? [Snow Mollusk spots them]
[cuts to Krusty Krab's safe with sticks of dynamite wrapped around it]
Plankton: [with a shield] Fire in the hole! [dynamite explodes, and safe is completely fine] Rats.
[cuts back to SpongeBob and others]
Sandy: Alright, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab! [closes one eye]
Patrick: [with lots of ice on eyes] I can't feel my looking holes!
SpongeBob: The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach. [stomach implodes]
Sandy: You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through all my provisions. [holds up empty nut bag] I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about anything! [eyes get bloodshot and drools, then thinks SpongeBob is cooked and on a stick] Mmmm... sponge kabob... [shakes head] Hey Patrick, you got any more of them Gooey Worms on you?
Patrick: I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least, [takes out bag of Jelly Beans] I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over. [eats a Jelly Bean] Hey! Is this taxi even moving?! [Gary shivering] Come on, Gary! [Gary falls]
SpongeBob: Gasp! Gary! [Gary's slime is frozen] Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard on you, didn't we? Sorry buddy, I won't make you tow another inch. [puts Gary in sleigh]
Patrick: Great, now we're stuck.
SpongeBob: No, we're not! [pulls ropes, and his arms shatter] Hello, what's this? [cuts to a small anchor] Look! One of Mr. Krabs' sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body.
Sandy: We must be heading in the right direction!
[cuts to Krusty Krab]
Plankton: [riding a small plane] [laughing] Secret formula, you are mine! [ejects himself out of plane]
[The plane hits the safe, but the safe is okay]
Plankton: Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one. [landing] That does it! Listen up safe, I will spill your contents, even if I have to tear you apart. [rips a piece of the safe] Bit by bit! [rips the piece he just rips] Molecule by molecule! [rips a molecule] Atom by atom!! [rips an atom, causing it to glow] Uh-oh.
[the atoms explode, obliterating the Krusty Krab and the safe]
Plankton: Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa! [takes the bottle containing the secret formula]
[cuts to SpongeBob and his friends] [SpongeBob is still dragging the sleigh, then suddenly hits something]
Patrick: [wakes up] Hey, i'm trying to sleep.
SpongeBob: [realizes that he hits Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Sandy: He ain't looking so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob?[realizes SpongeBob is frozen] He froze up too. [realizes that the others also frozen. Makes a fire form the sleigh to thaw them out]
Squidward: Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh!? Are you aware that that was our only mode of transportation?
Sandy: And are you aware I just saved your life?
Mr. Krabs: The race! The million clams! [gasps] I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings. [rattles Squidward]
Karen: Oh cool down there are no winnings, you've been duped!
Mr. Krabs: Duped? You don't mean by...
Karen: Now you're putting it together!
Mr. Krabs: My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!
Squidward:  We might actually have a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.
Mr. Krabs: We're doomed. [cries]
SpongeBob:  No we're not Mr. Krabs. [turns himself into sleigh] Your chariot awaits!
Mr. Krabs: No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace.
Sandy: Just leave that to the scientist of the group!
Patrick:  Oh geez. Why do I have to do everything?
Sandy: [Sandy creates a modified sleigh. Patrick is spinning from Karen's monitor as Squidward blows his clarinet onto the circuits]
Patrick: Hahahaha!
Sandy: She's all fired up!
SpongeBob: Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?
Mr. Krabs: Lookin' clear so far.
SpongeBob: Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!
French Narrator: One frozen wasteland later.
SpongeBob: Hooray! We made it.
Mr. Krabs: Okay... then where's my restaurant?
SpongeBob: Perhaps over there.. [points to smoldering place]
Mr. Krabs: And where's my formula? [runs over to safe]
Sandy: [points to Chum Bucket] Perhaps over there.
Mr. Krabs: The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?! [reading Chum Bucket sign]
SpongeBob: We're too late!
Mr. Krabs: We'll see about that boy-o!
Harold: [Mr. Krabs walks past line] Whoa whoa whoa whoa, you can't cut in line. We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!
Mr. Krabs: This will only take a minute. [smashes door]
Plankton:  Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open. [tries to open cork from the formula bottle]
Mr. Krabs: Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!
Plankton: Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?
Mr. Krabs: I guess I didn't want to miss the big unveiling of my sandwich.
Plankton:  Well, it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!
Patrick: Oh, that's easy! [lifts it out of the bottle.]
All of them: Patrick!
Plankton: Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy. [beings to run away]
Sandy:  That may be true, Plankton, but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides.
Plankton:&#160;: Uh... well, I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!
Karen: [sarcastically] You've gotta help me... My monitor nearly froze up for good on your little race to oblivion!
Plankton: Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon! [Karen zaps Plankton]
Plankton: Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Then hand over my formula.
Plankton: Okay, Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first. [He pulls out a pen and clicks it. It turns into a propeller.] Oop! Here I go! Hahahaha! Out smarted you again, aye, fools? [laughs and flies away into a pipe]
Mr. Krabs: You get back here, Plankton!
Squidward:  Here we go again...
Plankton: [exits through a vent outside the Chum Bucket, with everyone in close pursuit]
Mr. Krabs: Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!
Plankton: I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh! You're so close. [Plankton runs up some stair, and hops on top of something. The others follow him.] So long, suckers!
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Everyone: [gasps when they realize they’re inside a cage]
Plankton: Hehehe!
Mr. Krabs: We're trapped!
Plankton: That's right, Krabs, and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you.
Mr. Krabs: He's going to turn us into fried snacks!
Patrick: Got any dipping sauce?
Plankton: A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?
Abominable Snow Mollusk:  [makes loud noise, and grabs the cage] Nom nom!
SpongeBob: Nom nom?
Abominable Snow Mollusk: Nom nom! [rips the cage open, making everyone in it fall to the ground. She then snatches Patrick] Nom nom!
SpongeBob: W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me, i'm packed with nutrients!
Sandy: No, eat me!
Mr. Krabs: Don't eat me, eat Squidward!
Squidward: Wait, what?!
Abominable Snow Mollusk:  [reaches and takes jellybeans from Patrick’s pocket] Nom nom! [hugs Patrick]
SpongeBob: She loves your jellybeans, Patrick!
Plankton: I better go while the going's good.
Abominable Snow Mollusk:  [sees Plankton] Jellybean!
Plankton: I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now! [The Abominable Mollusk grabs him with her tongue; Plankton screams as she swallows him and Plankton releases the formula. It lands onto Mr. Krabs' claw and he puts it in his shirt.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?
Mr. Krabs: He'll just have to wait for nature to take its course. [laughs]
Plankton: [The Abominable Snow mollusk belches and inside her stomach shows Plankton sitting on a jellybean.] Well, I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration. [a flushing noise is then heard in the background, concluding the episode]


[The episode begins SpongeBob's, Squidward's and Patrick's houses at dusk.]
Patrick: Batter up!
[SpongeBob rolls in a little stove with pots, pans, a whisk, and a bowl. He pours pancake mix into the bowl and cracks two eggs. He mixes them up and puts the batter on the pan.]
SpongeBob: [flips the pancakes] Ah, oh.
[Patrick throws the pan and SpongeBob swings his own pan to hit it like he was playing baseball.]
Patrick: I got it, I got it! [falls on the ground as the pancakes land on his plate.]
SpongeBob: [sticks out his tongue] Wah! [eats one pancake]
[Patrick slurps down on the pancakes and the two friends give each other a high-five.]
Patrick: Whoo-hoo!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run around Squidward's house while banging on pots and pans. Moments later, an extremely irritated Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Patrick crash into the door, landing in front of Squidward.]
Squidward: What are you two dizzy dingbats doing out here?!
SpongeBob: Just treasuring our time together, Squidward.
Squidward: Well, that time is over! Say good night, go to your separate houses, and be quiet!
[SpongeBob and Patrick whimper and cry.]
Patrick: [cries] I can't do it! I can't be away from my best friend!
SpongeBob: [cries] No, it hurts too much!
[SpongeBob and Patrick continue to cry.]
Squidward: Oh, will you two cut it out?
[SpongeBob and Patrick stop crying.]
SpongeBob: Cut it out... Squidward, that's a great idea!
Squidward and Patrick: It is?
[SpongeBob takes out a pair of scissors, cuts off part of his head and forms it into a tiny version of himself.]
Patrick: Wow! My turn!
[Patrick rips his head off and also forms it into a tiny version of himself. SpongeBob and Patrick hug each as the tiny versions of themselves hug and dance around.]
Squidward: I think I'm gonna be sick! [gets sick and runs back into his house]
SpongeBob: [gives Mini SpongeBob to Patrick] Here you go, Patrick. Now we never have to be apart, [Patrick gives SpongeBob Mini Patrick] even when we're not together.
Patrick: This is great. See you forever, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yeah, see you forever, Patrick. [enters his house and yawns] Time for bed, Tiny Patrick.
[Mini Patrick jumps happily on SpongeBob's hands and hops on his head as SpongeBob goes upstairs. The scene changes to SpongeBob washing his face with soap and water. Mini Patrick jumps off of SpongeBob's head and dives into the sink. He pops out of the suds and rides on the rubber duck like a cowboy. The scene changes to Mini SpongeBob brushing Patrick's teeth. However, he shrivels up by the bad odor inside Patrick's mouth and falls into the sink.]
Patrick: Hmm.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob taking the clothes off of his teddy bear.]
Teddy Bear: Uh. [covers himself] Oh.
Mini Patrick: [now wearing the teddy bear's clothes] Ah. [SpongeBob puts a hat on Mini Patrick's head and they both laugh] Ah! [jumps into SpongeBob's arms]
[The scene changes to Patrick, Mini SpongeBob, SpongeBob and Mini Patrick sleeping together in their respective houses. The next day, SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab with Mini Patrick wearing a sailor suit.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward.
Squidward: Says who?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] You sit right there, my hungry little sailor, while I whip you up some grub from the galley. [pokes Mini Patrick]
Mini Patrick: [laughs] Dah, uh-huh.
[SpongeBob takes out a small version of his grill and puts a tiny Krabby Patty on it to cook. Mini Patrick's mouth waters.]
Mini Patrick: Ah.
[SpongeBob fixes up the tiny Krabby Patty for Mini Patrick and serves it to him. Mini Patrick dances gleefully and goes to enjoy his sandwich.]
Mini Patrick: Ahh. Hmm? [sees the bigger Krabby Patties on the grill and whimpers; he throws away the tiny Krabby Patty] Ahhh! Yah! [jumps off the counter and flies over to the grill, but gets slammed in the face by SpongeBob's spatula]
SpongeBob: Huh? Careful there, little buddy. The grill is hot. [puts Mini Patrick back on the counter with his spatula]
Mini Patrick: [gasps as he sees SpongeBob dump French fries into the fryer] Ohhh.
[SpongeBob pushes down the fryer and begins making French fries. Mini Patrick climbs down from the counter, climbs on the fryer and goes to dive in the cooking oil.]
SpongeBob: [struggles to open a pickle jar] Huh?
Mini Patrick: [jumps real high] Whee-ah! [lands in SpongeBob's hat]
SpongeBob: Stop! [squeezes Mini Patrick out of his hat] Bad, Tiny Patrick! Hmm. [takes out rope and ties Mini Patrick with it] Sorry to do this, little guy, but I have to keep you safe while I get some work done. [ties the rope around his waist and puts Mini Patrick in his pocket; then he goes back to flipping patties on the grill] Ah-yah.
[Mini Patrick pulls himself out of SpongeBob's pocket and swings himself into the side of the grill. crashing into it. Mini Patrick whimpers. Meanwhile, back at Patrick's house, Patrick and Mini SpongeBob are still sleeping. The sand clock rings 12:00 and Patrick bangs on it to stop. Patrick and Mini SpongeBob stretch and yawn.]
Patrick: Good morning.
[Mini SpongeBob jumps on a sand table and holds out a knife and fork; ready for breakfast. Patrick brings out various foods and makes it into a sandwich. He sticks out his tongue and eats the whole thing. leaving Mini SpongeBob stunned.]
Patrick: Didn't think I was gonna be able to eat all that. But then I did! [laughs]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob returning home with Mini Patrick, who isn't to trilled with SpongeBob's pampering and is now dressed in a fancy suit.]
SpongeBob: [humming as he brushes Mini Patrick's hair] Brushy, brushy, brushy. [sees Patrick and Mini SpongeBob trying to lift a sand sofa]
Patrick: Come on, Tiny SpongeBob. You gotta lift with your back.
[Mini SpongeBob tries to lift the sand sofa, but it is too big and heavy for him. Patrick sees SpongeBob and lets go of the sand sofa, flattening Mini SpongeBob underneath.]
Patrick: Oh, oh. Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, hi. [gets nervous]
Patrick: [makes a weird face] Eeh. [gets nervous] Hmm. Hmm.
[SpongeBob becomes more nervous and couldn't figure out what to say. The sand sofa crumbles. Mini SpongeBob pops out of the sand pile, gasping tp breathe.]
SpongeBob: So, uh, I'd love to hang out, but I already have some plans with Tiny Patrick here.
Patrick: Oh, yeah, well, me and Tiny SpongeBob, [picks up Mini SpongeBob] we're pretty busy tonight, so good night.
SpongeBob: Good night.
[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick cry out for each other. It seems as though that SpongeBob and Patrick are unintentionally preventing their miniature selves from seeing each other. The scene changes to Mini Patrick now dressed in some baby pajamas with a zipper. He is growing tired of SpongeBob's pampering.]
SpongeBob: I don't want you getting into trouble during the night, so you're gonna stay in the aquarium like a good little sleepy clam. [drops Mini Patrick in the aquarium]
Mini Patrick: Ahh! [tries to climb out, but SpongeBob puts a pile of books on top of the aquarium. SpongeBob goes to sleep as Mini Patrick knocks on the aquarium. The scene changes to Mini SpongeBob trying to open a jar of seanut butter, but couldn't because he only has one arm.]
Patrick: Huh? Hey. Didn't you used to have one two...two arms? Okay, little buddy. Let's find that arm of yours. Oh. [digs under his sand chair] Oh. [finds remote] Nope. [finds wallet] Nope. Hmm. [finds Mini SpongeBob's arm] Huh?
Mini SpongeBob: Ah!
Patrick: Nope. [finds plastic toy arm] Oh. Ah-ha! I got it! [puts Mini SpongeBob in a little tool and tightens him real tight] I'll fix you up in no time. [he drills the toy arm into Mini SpongeBob's body] Good as new.
Mini SpongeBob: Ehh. Huh? [looks at his new arm, tries it, but it swings and bashes his head]
Patrick: Okay, good night. [falls asleep]
Mini SpongeBob: Huh? [snaps his fingers to wake Patrick up, but no avail]
[Mini SpongeBob jumps down, turns off the light and leaves Patrick alone, sleeping in his house. He sneaks into SpongeBob's house through his closet.]
Mini SpongeBob: Oh?
[Mini SpongeBob looks around and sees Mini Patrick sleeping in the aquarium. He climbs up and wakes up Mini Patrick. He rips off the toy arm and regenerates his real arm.]
Mini SpongeBob: Ding! [puts the toy arm under the aquarium] Yah! [hops on the toy arm and makes the aquarium fall and break, freeing Mini Patrick in the process]
SpongeBob: [snores, grumbles] Yes, Squidward, extra mayo, I heard you.
[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick look at each other. Mini Patrick sees how beaten up Mini SpongeBob is just as Mini SpongeBob sees how pampered Mini Patrick is being. Both of them grumble, for they have had enough of SpongeBob and Patrick's treatment towards them and vowed to get even with them. The scene changes to SpongeBob waking up.]
SpongeBob: [wakes up, looks around and sees Patrick next to him] Oh, hi, Patrick.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I don't remember us having a sleepover last night.
[They look down and realized that they are both nailed to the floor. Thy struggle to free themselves until Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick climb onto Patrick's belly and jump up and down.]
Patrick: What's going on, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, little guys. You're playing with each other. So cute.
[Both Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick grumble and pull out a jackhammer and a pair of pliers. Mini Patrick digs the pliers in SpongeBob's nose and pulls out a long piece of nose hair. Mini SpongeBob drills a hole in the middle of Patrick's face and pours pepper through the hole. Patrick goes to sneeze, but Mini SpongeBob ties up Patrick's mouth, making his head puff up and explode. Mini Patrick pulls on SpongeBob's toes. Mini SpongeBob mows Patrick's eyebrows. Mini Patrick smudges lipstick on SpongeBob's face. Mini SpongeBob punches Patrick's eyeball with a boxing glove.]
Mini SpongeBob: Whew.
[Both Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick shake hands as they have gotten their revenge on their tormenters.]
Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick: Huh?
[Mini SpongeBob's stomach grumbles and points to his mouth.]
Mini SpongeBob: Ah, ah. [licks his lips and sees the refrigerator]
[Mini Patrick points to the television. They both chitter gleefully and go to do their activity. Mini SpongeBob climbs up the stove and puts a pan on it. Then he opens the fridge.]
Mini SpongeBob: Hey!
[Mini SpongeBob climbs back onto the stove with an egg. He cracks it open and goes to fry the egg. He then attempts to flip it with a spatula.]
Patrick: What are they doing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Just trying to live their lives, Patrick. Just trying to live their lives.
[Mini Patrick attempts lift the remote, but couldn't because it was too big and heavy.]
SpongeBob: Poor little guys.
[Mini SpongeBob attempts to flip the egg, but ends up sending himself and the egg flying into the television.]
SpongeBob: Our world is just too big for them. Ohh, I have an idea. [slithers himself free]
Patrick: Oh, I hope it's not another one of your crazy plans to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.
SpongeBob: You're thinking of Plankton, Patrick.
Patrick: [realizing his error]Oh, yeah!
[SpongeBob frees Patrick and they run off. SpongeBob grabs a toolbox. Patrick grabs paint cans. SpongeBob grabs a bowl of fruit. They both run outside and prepare to build something. Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick follow them outside.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! A tiny house for my tiny friend.
Mini SpongeBob: Ahh! [chuckles and hugs his new pineapple house]
Patrick: Oh, I get it!
[Patrick grabs a smaller rock and drops it onto Mini Patrick. Mini Patrick opens it and laughs.]
SpongeBob: Nice work, Patrick. Whoops! [grabs a tiny snail] Almost forgot. [gives the tiny snail to Mini SpongeBob] You've got to have a Gare-Bear.
Mini SpongeBob: Oh, yay!
Mini Patrick: Ohh. [Patrick taps his shoulder] Huh? [chuckles as Patrick gives Mini Patrick a chicken leg and hugs it]
[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick goes into their respective houses.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aww. [hug each other] Hmm. [the sky gets dark and turns to night]
Patrick: Hmm?
SpongeBob: Let's leave 'em alone, Patrick.
[SpongeBob and Patrick tip-toe away. Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick come out and begin talking. They've realized that something is missing in between their houses. So, they run off to get it. The next day, a small sand castle version of Squidward's house is shown. Squidward's eyes open in the sand.]
Squidward: [wakes up] Ah, too bright. [hears chattering] Oh, those two again!
[Squidward shakes the sand off. It appears that Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick snuck into Squidward's house, took Squidward and buried him up to his head in the sand right in between their houses. Just then, Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick run around Squidward, banging pots and pans really loud.]
Squidward: What the—
[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick continue to bang on pots and pans like the actual SpongeBob and Patrick did early in the episode. Mini Patrick throws a pot and Mini SpongeBob hits it like a baseball, hitting Squidward in the nose.]
Squidward: Ow! [grumbles angrily]
[Mini SpongeBob and Mini Patrick gasp, jump onto Squidward's nose, and hug his nose as an apology.]
Squidward: No, get away. Get away! [screams as the camera pulls back; ending the episode]


[While SpongeBob sleeps, Gary notices his food bowl is empty. So, he slithers up to the diving board, jumps off, and starts to lick SpongeBob, who giggles and wakes up]
SpongeBob: Gary! What are you doing!?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say [rushes to get food] organic!
Gary: Meow? [raspberries]
SpongeBob: There you go, Gary! [Gary sniffs it and rejects the food. He slithers over to a fungus growing on the floor, smiles, and eats some] Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!
Gary: [Mocking] Meow, meow, meow... [SpongeBob attempts to clean it, but to no avail]
SpongeBob: What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off! [The doorbell rings] Ooh! Company! [itches his head as he answers the door]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob! Eww! [gasps]
SpongeBob: Is something wrong, Patrick?
Patrick: SpongeBob! What is that?
SpongeBob: What's what?
Patrick: This! [bends SpongeBob's head over so he can see the fungus on his head]
SpongeBob: [Screams] P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?
Patrick: Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!
SpongeBob: Good idea! [He does so]
Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Patrick: I don't know about this!
SpongeBob: What makes you say that?
Patrick: This.
[He takes out a mirror and shows SpongeBob that the fungus has spread]
SpongeBob: [screams] Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger! [gulps] Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure! [He spreads some on] Aah. That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?
Patrick: Sure do! Well, Probably gonna go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal.
SpongeBob: Bye, Patrick! [Patrick leaves, and SpongeBob goes and takes a shower. He lathers the soap into an anchor shape, and when he rinses, the fungus is in an anchor shape] Ahh… This feels better! [doing a crossword] Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis… Hmm… [He feels an itch] Itch! [Starts scratching his head; cuts to the Krusty Krab] Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away… Eventually. [As he says this, a piece of fungus comes down onto his nose. He flings it onto the wall, but another one grows, so he pushes his nose in] There! Outta sight, outta mind! [sees the fungus on the wall, scoops it up, and tries to throw it away, but it sticks] I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking! [puts on gloves from a first aid kit] Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties… Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must… Stop… Scratching! [Squidward comes in]
Squidward: SpongeBob! [screams and sees SpongeBob scratching the fungus] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?
SpongeBob: All what-y?
Squidward: Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?
SpongeBob: Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all! [His nose pops out with the fungus, and Squidward screams. He jumps to the top of the cabinet]
Squidward: That's no blemish!
SpongeBob: Help… Me!
Squidward: Oh, I'll help you, alright! [takes out a phone]
S.W.A.T. fish #1: S.W.A.T. Team. [Gibberish on the other end] We'll be right over! [The team breaks through the ceiling of the Krusty Krab and slide down ropes from a helicopter]
S.W.A.T. fish #2: Hold it right there! Neptune's trident! This is the most severe case of Ick yet. [tries to touch SpongeBob]
S.W.A.T. fish #3: Stop, you fool! [smacks other fish's hand away] Do you wanna get infected? This is a job for the hazmat physician.
Hazmat physician: Get back! I said, get back! Back I say! [pushes SpongeBob into a cage, which is promptly lifted by a helicopter]
SpongeBob: What's going on, Squidward? Help! [As the helicopter flies away, a piece of fungus attaches itself to Squidward. Later, at the cash register]
Squidward: [to Old Man Jenkins] Here's your change, sir. [As he hands him the coins, some fungus gets on the old man. He puts them in his pockets, then readjusts his glasses, which leaves fungus all over his nose]
Old Man Jenkins: Oh, why thank you very much, young man.
Squidward: What was that? No, no, Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick. [starts scratching himself]
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob, being completely covered in fungus, is encased in a bubble with tubes coming from it]
SpongeBob: Where am I? Whoa! [Doctors are talking to each other] Who are you people? I wanna go home! [A scientist walks up towards SpongeBob]
Scientist: You are home, SpongeBob. You just have to stay in this bubble until the Ick clears up.
SpongeBob: Where's my snail, Gary?
Scientist: We've taken care of your pet. [Gary is encased in a bubble similar to SpongeBob's]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary? Whoa! [notices someone scanning him]
Hazmat Physician: He appears stable, sir.
Scientist: Alright, boys, let's pack it up.
[The scientists leave, scene cuts to outside SpongeBob's pineapple house, covered in a plastic bag, with police tape and barbed wire around it, with a board written "Quarantine" on it. SpongeBob is filter-feeding, when Patrick walks in]
Patrick: Wow! [bumps into the bubble] Huh? What is this? [pokes]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!
Patrick: Really? How about if I squeeze it like this? [squeezes it, SpongeBob gasps] Or this? [bites it, SpongeBob gasps again] Or this? [digs cleats into it]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick! How many times do I have to tell you?! Be careful!
Patrick: Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?
SpongeBob: Sure! Let's begin! [They take out hooks and tear up the bubble] Um... Patrick?
Patrick: I win! I win! I win!
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: [starts dancing around and doing the "Worm"] Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!
SpongeBob: [stands and gets Patrick's attention as he stops dancing] Patrick! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed.
Patrick: I've got an idea! [He pulls out bubble soap and begins to blow a bubble around SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands! Huh?[notices the bubble] Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile! [wheels it around a little] Now I can go back to work! [puts on his hat. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where Squidward is scratching]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Help! [pulls Squidward through the window into the kitchen] Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there!
Squidward: [shakes his head, and gets Ick all over the food] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Mr. Krabs: Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? Oh… If only SpongeBob were here…
Squidward: If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in Ick! [scratches, oblivious to the fact that he has Ick all over him, too] Lunch is served! [gives Ick Patties to a couple] Eat up, kids. [The kids bite into their Ick kid's meal, and as everyone bites into their food, Squidward scratches all over]
Nathiel Waters: [drinks from an Ick milkshake, he has an ick mustache and beard afterwards] Ahh.
Squidward: [now completely green] Oh, why am I so itchy? [gets some on the wall and sees that he has the fungus] Oh no. [screams and all the customers look at him] SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people! [An angry mob forms around Squidward] Stay back, you diseased freaks!
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs, covered in the ick, slams opens the door on Squidward] What's all the commotion about?
Unknown Fish: [With accent] The commotion, my dear Krabs, is regarding the hygiene standards of your eating establishment, which would appear to be inadequate.
Mr. Krabs: Inadequate!? I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free. [door opens and Mr. Krabs is awestruck]
SpongeBob: Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir.
[Everybody turns to SpongeBob in his bubble, who has swollen up to an enormous green circle. He puts on his hat, and squirts green juice inside his bubble. The fish gasp]
Unknown Fish: Is that what you consider clean and disease-free, Krabby? I say we ramshack this greasy disease shack! Who's with me?
All: We are!
Mr. Krabs: It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!
Squidward: No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab! [everybody growls and screams]
Unknown Fish: Let us apprehend that careless contaminator! [All the fish attack SpongeBob, who starts crying, making a huge puddle in his bubble. Outside the Krusty Krab, Gary slithers into the dumpster and eats a can, which he coughs up. His stomach growls as he slithers out]
Gary: Meow. [sees SpongeBob inside getting attacked by the Krusty Krab fish]
SpongeBob: [crying] [the fish body slam SpongeBob's bubble, which make holes that the Ick leaks through] Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick! [the unknown fish the other fish make a final body slam] NOOOOO! [All the fish slam into it, and it pops, splattering Ick all over the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs starts laughing]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!
Squidward: It's not me, Mr. Krabs! [Gary is crawling all over Mr. Krabs, sucking all the fungus off him]
SpongeBob: Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission? [We see Gary clean the Ick off of Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid! [Gary sucks the fungus off Squidward, next]
Nat Peterson: [Excitedly] Oh! Oh! Me next!
Martha Smith: [Scolding as Squidward walks off]Where are your manners? It's ladies first!
Patrick: I believe the expression is starfish first.
Unknown Fish: I supersede all of you! For I have an exotic accent.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with. [Later…] Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars! [The first fish steps up, and Gary cleans him]
Mr. Krabs: Now can I get you a Krabby Patty? [The guy whacks him with his glove]
Unknown Fish: In the light of today's events, that notion is crass and offensive. [pulls out money] I'll take two, please.
Mr. Krabs: Alright! [SpongeBob is next. He hands Krabs the money]
SpongeBob: Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Another 5 dollars for another de-Ickin'. [Gary cleans SpongeBob off]
SpongeBob: Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!
Mr. Krabs: Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work! [Gary burps loudly, then smiles]


[Squidward is sleeping until SpongeBob knocks on the door causing him to wake up]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: [opens his window] What do you want, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar. [laughs]
Squidward: More like another nickel.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Good one, Squidward! [scene cuts to Squidward and SpongeBob walking down the street and SpongeBob is laughing] Another day, another nickel. [laughs]
Squidward: It's not that funny.
SpongeBob: It's funny, because it's true! [laughs. SpongeBob clings on to Squidward's legs as they walk into the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Move over. [flicks SpongeBob off his legs and into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [peeks through the kitchen window] Nickel. [laughs]
Squidward: [brings food tray over to a customer] Here's your food. [SpongeBob is laughing behind him] It's not that funny! [slams tray down] Please make it stop! [SpongeBob is running into the kitchen then out of Mr. Krabs office still laughing. Scene zooms into Squidward with a bunch of SpongeBobs laughing around his head. Scene cuts to Squidward flipping the 'OPEN' sign to 'CLOSED' then walking out of the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob still laughing. Squidward enters his house then shuts the door in SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, see you tomorrow. [laughs. Scene cuts to morning at the Krusty Krab]
Customer #1: And always check for spare change.
SpongeBob: Another day, another...nickel! [brings food to customer] 2 Krabby Patties.
Customer #2: Thanks, kid.
SpongeBob: Another day, another nickel.
Customer #2: Oh. [all 3 of them laugh]
Squidward: He's gone laughing tormentor. [SpongeBob continues to laugh but every few seconds, he gets an ache in his side and Squidward takes notice of this] This could be my chance. [enters kitchen] SpongeBob, you don't look well!
SpongeBob: I don't?
Squidward: No. You should sit down.
SpongeBob: But...
Squidward: [sticks a cooking thermometer in SpongeBob's mouth] Shh, shh, shh. [feels his forehead] You're burning up, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I am?
Squidward: Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?
SpongeBob: Yeah, a little.
Squidward: And your temperature is 175 degrees!
SpongeBob: It's that bad?
Squidward: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing.
SpongeBob: I have been laughing a lot, lately.
Squidward: [gasps] SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're going to burn out your laugh box.
SpongeBob: My laugh box?
Squidward: Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again.
SpongeBob: Is that what happened to you, Squidward?
Squidward: Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again. [scene fades to Sandy walking up to Patrick]
Sandy: Hey, Patrick, you want to hear a joke?
Patrick: Sure, Sandy.
SpongeBob: [in a lung capacity machine] Sure, I'd love a good laugh.
Sandy: What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck! [Sandy and Patrick laugh normally while SpongeBob's laugh is robotic. Sandy and Patrick giggle nervously and backs away slowly]
SpongeBob: I don't want to burn out my laugh box, Squidward.
Squidward: Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous.
SpongeBob: How long do I have to avoid laughing?
Squidward: Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe.
SpongeBob: Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you! [later SpongeBob is walking out of the Krusty Krab] A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant. [looks over to his right] Nothing funny over there. [looks over to his left] Nothing funny over here.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?
SpongeBob: [notices banana peel in front of Patrick on the ground] Patrick, banana peel, don't!
Patrick: What'd you say? [slips on banana peel]
SpongeBob: Oh, no. [stifles laughter]
Patrick: Hey, what the... [slips on banana peel again]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, Patrick! [Patrick slips on the banana peel again] Please stop!
Patrick: Right foot first...
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh.
Patrick: You can't? Oh, I know what to do! [flaps his lips and SpongeBob runs away] That usually knocks him out. [continues flapping his lips then slips on the banana peel again]
SpongeBob: [runs behind a building] Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control. [steps on a whoopee cushion] Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob. [steps on another whoopee cushion. He gasps] They're everywhere. Everywhere!
Delivery Fish: Look out for that pie truck! [pie truck crashes into the whoopee cushion truck. SpongeBob laughs a little as the big pie on top of the truck falls on the driver]
SpongeBob: I gotta get outta here. [runs out of the Bikini Bottom city limits] There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe... [digs himself a hole to bury himself in. He gets in. Now only his nose is seen. He stays there as the day turns to night, then it is morning and a clam crows like a rooster] Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing. [tries to laugh, but wheezes instead] That's odd. [wheezes again, with a weird deflating sound] I've lost my laugh. [screams and runs back into Bikini Bottom] I've lost my laugh! [screams again, then knocks on Patrick's rock]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!
Patrick: What happened?
SpongeBob: I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone.
Patrick: Let me take a look. [inserts his head into SpongeBob's mouth] Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match. [lights a match. Smoke fills SpongeBob and Patrick can't get him off his head so he runs around screaming. Later, at the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Come in.
SpongeBob: [crying] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: I lost my laugh.
Mr. Krabs: You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh. [both look at money but only Mr. Krabs laughs] Don't it just tickle you, boy?
SpongeBob: Not really.
Mr. Krabs: This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it.
SpongeBob: [touches money] Nothing.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy.
SpongeBob: Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist. [later at Sandy's treedome]
Sandy: Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob. Now, what is laughter?
SpongeBob: The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose, but now mocks me with its cruel indifference.
Sandy: [pulls down a chart of the body] But scientifically speaking, it's caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset.
SpongeBob: Sounds painful.
Sandy: Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob. [hands SpongeBob a bunch of books] Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Sandy.
Squidward: Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack.
SpongeBob: I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again. [moans and groans into his pineapple]
Squidward: I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy. [laughs. "Later that same evening timecard is shown and the French narrator reads it]
Narrator: Later that same evening...
Squidward: [is playing clarinet when he hears SpongeBob crying] I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon. [SpongeBob cries tears on the side of Squidward's house and night turns into day as Squidward's house plugs up its ears] What have I done? [SpongeBob cries a river into Squidward's house causing it to flood him outside] Oh, that's it! This charade has to end. [realizes his feet are underwater and walks to SpongeBob's house. He knocks on SpongeBob's door and lots of tears come out]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop.
SpongeBob: But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box! [sprays a fountain of tears into Squidward's face. Squidward puts his tentacles over SpongeBob's eyes, stopping the tears]
Squidward: SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!
SpongeBob: You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression.
Squidward: (taken aback by the revelation) Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes.
SpongeBob: I could laugh the whole time?
Squidward: Yeah. [both laugh] You really fell for it.
SpongeBob: I guess I did.
Squidward: You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [stops laughing] It's really not that funny, Squidward.
Squidward: It's hilarious!
SpongeBob: See ya later, Squidward. [goes into his house]
Squidward: [still laughing] Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel. [his laughter turns to coughing as his sides started aching] yahhhh! [Squidward inhales deeply and lets out a long cough, (thus losing his laughter) and falls flat to the ground, while two paramedics come take him to the hospital]
Patrick: Look, he's waking up.
Squidward: (groans) Where am I?
Sandy: You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box.
Mr. Krabs: The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on.
Patrick: So they cut it out.
Squidward: Cut it out?!
Patrick: Yeah, wanna see it? [holds up jar with Squidward's laugh box in it] It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around.
Squidward: [screams] Gimme! Oh. I can never laugh again?
Doctor: Nonsense. Your laugh should be stronger than ever.
Squidward: But, you cut out my laugh box.
Doctor: Yes, but uhh, one of your friends generously allowed us to transplant part of theirs to you.
Patrick: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: They wouldn't pay me.
Sandy: You're getting warmer.
Squidward: [SpongeBob shows his scar] SpongeBob? [laughs like SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hey, you laugh just like me. [both laugh. Squidward laughs too much so he runs through the wall] Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world. [laughs]


SpongeBob: Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time! [Gary's pupils dilate] Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way, [zooms in on Gary's eyes] or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way... [Gary just stares] So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
SpongeBob: Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch! [Throws the ball to Gary. Toy boomerangs back to SpongeBob and he reads the box] Huh? "New" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm. [throws the box but it boomerangs back and hits SpongeBob in the head]
SpongeBob: [with a bomb strapped to his chest] Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath! [Gary doesn't react] Please...? [bomb explodes] I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages!
[pictures of a bathtub, a shower faucet running, and then a bar of soap come up, then a disturbing picture of a giggling girl appears]
Subliminal Girl: [high-pitched laugh]
SpongeBob: Sorry you had to see that. [on the phone] Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath. [person on the other side is talking] What? Can you say that again? [Gary slithers away] Slow down! It's like you're speaking some other language! [hangs up] Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leapfrog? Weehee! Okay, your turn. [flips Gary into the wall and breaks his shell, then we see Gary with his shell bandaged] Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leapfrog? [Gary whacks him on the head with a cane] ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house! [Mr. Krabs comes in taking a bath then takes SpongeBob's dollar] Ya-da-da-da... [stops dancing] That didn't work either, huh? [Gary is sleeping. SpongeBob, who is dressed as a pirate, runs to Gary, who wakes up] Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house! Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure! Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen... [nervously looks at Gary] 40. The treasure must be in here! [opens bathroom door] Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Why, no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub. [Kicks away a paint can] It's treasure! Look, doubloons! [shows 2 bars of soap] Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch! [shows a rubber ducky]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is on SpongeBob] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] Get in the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but is unsuccessful again] In the tub! [tries to throw Gary in the tub but he floats over the tub, and appears back on the floor after 2 seconds] Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to... [pulls up Gary off the floor but both end up dangling from the ceiling] Gary, could you... [Gary sucks in one of his eyes into his head and SpongeBob loses his grip] Gary, no! [Gary pulls in other eye] Gary! [SpongeBob falls in the tub]. Alright, Gary, you have duped and/or frustrated me for the last time! So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. [absorbs all the water in the bathtub]. Psst, Gary. Bath delivery! [SpongeBob spits water at Gary but misses and hits the armchair instead]. Come back, Gary! I have something to "chair" with you. [SpongeBob spits more water at Gary but misses and hits dirty dishes, which cleans and stacks them] "Dish" is more like it! "Water" you waiting for, Gary?
Gary: [meowing in a tree]
SpongeBob: Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary! [spits out water at Gary but realizes it's a gramophone playing a record of Gary's meows]. Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin! [Gary, while meowing mockingly, takes the ladder off the tree] Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant! [ladder falls down] I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath and you are going to get clean right now!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I am so the boss of you!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say. [Gary slithers forward] What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister! [Gary stops right next to some mud] Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary The Snail, do you hear me? I am giving you 3 seconds to get away from that mud puddle! 1, [Gary moves closer to the mud] 2, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two and a half... [Gary leans over the mud] don't make me say 3! [Gary leans further over the mud] Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!! [SpongeBob falls out of the tree and into the mud] I'm a dirty boy... [SpongeBob is in the bathtub]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, Gary. [scrubs his ears] I'm getting behind my ears. [Gary grins]


[The episode begins at nighttime in Bikini Bottom.]
Sandy: Howdy, neighbor. It's your old pal, Sandy Cheeks with a true to life tale direct from Bikini Bottom. It's the end of another long day, and every critter in town is getting ready to hit the hay.
[Fred is shown brushing his teeth and Debbie Rechid is reading a bedtime story to her child.]
Farmer fish: [punches the hay stack and forms into a bed] Whoo-hoo! [jumps on the hay bed and goes to sleep]
[The scene goes to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Gary are getting ready for bed.]
Sandy: Even little old SpongeBob and Gary are laying down their weary heads.
SpongeBob: [crawls into bed with Gary] Night Gare-bear. [yawns and goes to sleep]
Sandy: Now snails love to sleep, but they also like to have their fun. And clever little Gary here is no different. [giggles as Gary forms a slime decoy of himself and slithers off the bed] With a dang nifty decoy in place, Gary is ready to hit the town.
[Gary exits SpongeBob's house and slithers to Squidward's garbage cans.]
Sandy: But first things first. That gooey little varmint is mighty hungry. [chuckles as Gary climbs into the garbage cans and eats some trash] It may not look like much to you and me, but this here is four-star dining to a snail. [laughs]
[Gary hops over to another garbage can and eats some more trash. Suddenly, Patrick appears from the trash and he looks angry.]
Sandy: Now, Gary never minds running into a friend, but old Patrick here don't seem ready to share his meal.
[Patrick and Gary hop out of the garbage cans and they chase around. Patrick barks at Gary like a mad dog. Gary makes a loud roar, which terrifies Patrick. Patrick then turns and runs away.]
Sandy: Ol' Gary feels as big as a ten-point buck right now, but he's about to be reminded that life ain't all fun and games. Especially when animal control is on your tail.
[Just like what Sandy said, a truck pulls over and an animal control officer named Marvin appears.]
Marvin: Freeze, slime ball!
Gary: Meow. [slithers away]
Marvin: Hmm? [growls]
[Marvin goes to chase Gary, but he slips on the trash goo. He falls onto the ground while getting his capture pole tangled to his head. With Marvin all tangled up, Gary laughs and checks his watch. He then tiptoes away.]
Sandy: As much as Gary likes getting one over on the heat, he has more important matters to attend to.
[The scene changes to Gary slithering to the Chum Bucket.]
Sandy: This here is old Plankton's restaurant, the Chum Bucket. Gary ain't here for vittles, though. No one's ever at the Chum Bucket for vittles.
[Gary enters the Chum Bucket through the restaurant's sign. He breaks through the ceiling vet where he almost woke Plankton up with the metal door. He then slithers across the ceiling. Gary's slime drops into Plankton's mouth. Plankton coughs and spits the slime out before going back to sleep.]
Gary: Whew!
[Spot is shown sleeping on Plankton's bed.]
Sandy: That there's Spot. Plankton's pet amoeba and Gary's best friend.
Gary: Psst.
[Spot wakes up and starts barking.]
Sandy: Spot's cute, but about as dumb as a barrel of hair. [Spot's barking is making Plankton and Karen uncomfortable to sleep] Gary better think quick or they'll both be busted before their night's even begun.
[Karen puts earmuffs on her monitor and goes back to sleep. Gary lowers his left eye stalk to cover Spot's mouth. But Spot forms a mouth on the other end of his body and resumes barking. Karen bangs on the desk to stop the noise. She accidentally hits Plankton.]
Plankton: Ough! [groans before going back to sleep]
[Gary covers Spot's other end and lifts him up. Then Gary and Spot leave the Chum Bucket to begin their nighttime activities.]
Sandy: Ol' Gary and Spot have been sneaking out for ages though their owners are none the wiser. [giggles as Gary and Spot play together] They love playing all sorts of games together, but their doggone favorite is wrestling.
[Gary and Spot wrestle around for a while until they flung themselves through the chimney of the Krusty Krab. They both end up on top of the grill in the kitchen.]
Sandy: It's the Krusty Krab kitchen. What a stroke of luck.
[Gary looks around for Spot until he finds him.]
Sandy: Gary and Spot must have worked up quite an appetite with all them fun and games.
[Gary and Spot's stomach rumbles and they smell something really good. The smell is coming from the refrigerator. Gary and Spot's mouths water and they go to the fridge to get some food. But unfortunately, the door is locked.]
Sandy: Uh oh. That ice box is locked up tighter than a horse thief in a hoosegow.
[Spot gets so mad with hunger. He barks and knocks everything over, making a big mess in the kitchen. He hits the fridge and knocks it over before flying out into the dining room. The fridge opens and food comes out.]
Sandy: Oh boy. It's chow time.
[Gary goes to eat until he hears Spot barking in the dining room. Gary sees how hungry Spot is and comes up with an idea. He morphs himself to look like SpongeBob and imitates the SpongeBob laughter. Spot happily barks and hops onto the tables while knocking them over. He peeks into the kitchen and sees what Gary's cooking. Gary is piling up food onto a plate and makes a humongous sandwich.]
Sandy: Whoo-whee! Looks like Gary is cooking up some fun.
[Gary pushes the plateful of food on the window and rings the bell. The food falls onto Spot and Gary jumps out. Gary and Spot then go to eat their meal.]
Sandy: It may not be pretty, but to a critter, chow is chow.
[Gary and Spot both eat all of the food until there's nothing left. Then they go to play around, leaving the Krusty Krab a big mess. At the very same moment, Marvin drives by, looking for Gary.]
Marvin: Come out, come out. [gasps as he hears Gary in the Krusty Krab] Oh, there you are. [bursts through the front door and Gary and Spot stop playing; he slips on the floor, but gets up] Ha ha! I've got you this time. [slips on the Krabby Patty and falls on his face]
[Gary and Spot quickly run off to escape the animal control officer. Just then, Mr. Krabs comes in and is not very happy.]
Mr. Krabs: Ahem.
Marvin: [holds up his license, but is covered in tomato goo] Animal control, citizen. I'm hunting an errant snail.
Mr. Krabs: I don't give a sea fig about snails! You tripped me silent alarm! [points to an alarm bell with a mime face on it while making a faint tapping noise] Just look at this mess! [attacks Marvin with his claws] Take that, you varmint! [continues attacking Marin] Take that!
Marvin: Ow! Ow! Ow!
[Gary and Spot escape the Krusty Krab while Mr. Krabs continues to attack Marvin.]
Sandy: [giggles] Looks like our boys gave Johnny law the slip again. [Gary and Spot head over to an old sunken ship] Reckon they're gonna need some place to lay low for a while.
Gary and Spot: Whew!
[Suddenly, eerie eyes appear from the darkness. The eyes get closer and reveal themselves to be random animals. Snails, worms, sea urchins, and sea horses.]
Sandy: Uh oh. Looks like their hiding spot's already occupado.
[Just when it looks as though the animals are going to attack Gary and Spot, they instead huddle with them for they seem to know them.]
Sandy: Luckily for them, Gary and Spot are already pals with everyone here.
Patrick: Let's get this party started!
[One worm, who is the DJ, cranks up the music and all of the animals including Patrick dances. However, at that very same moment, Marvin drives up and hears the music.]
Sandy: Uh oh. Looks like the fuzz ain't gonna give up so easy.
Marvin: Hey, this is my jam. [goes in to join in the dancing]
Sandy: They say that music soothes the savage beast.
Marvin: [slides in and dances to the music] Oh, yeah, Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Sandy: But sometimes it works on knuckleheads too.
Marvin: [spins on the floor] That's how you do it. You do it. You do it. [stops dancing; the DJ worm stops the music in shock] Uh, you animals are under arrest? [the animals and Patrick growl angrily] Uh... Uh oh.
[The animals and Patrick lunge at Marvin and attack him.]
Sandy: Youch! That's gotta hurt. Oh mama!
[Gary and Spot abandon the fight and escape the sunken ship. They both hide behind a rock. Marvin comes out and throws Patrick and the animals into his truck. Then he drives away.]
Sandy: I guess this party just got pooped. [Spot cries, but Gary comforts him] Luckily, SpongeBob's little Gare-bear always has something under his shell.
[Spot slithers under Gary to form wheels. Then Gary and Spot follow the truck to the animal shelter. They both slam into the front door, which is locked up tight.]
Sandy: Locked doors are never a problem for a snail like Gary.
[Gary forms a slime key and Spot uses it to unlock the door. Spot gives Gary the A-Ok and the duo enter the animal shelter. As they wonder down the hallway, they see their animal friends and Patrick locked in cages.]
Sandy: Now to most animals, the pound is scarier than a bobcat in your long johns. But Gary and Spot are on a mission to save their pals.
[They continue wondering down the hallway while seeing everyone looking depressed while being imprisoned. But when they reached the end of the hallway, they find an emergency cage release lever.]
Gary: Ah-ha!
[Spot hops onto Gary's shell, takes his left eye stalk and lassos the lever to pull it down. The cages open and Patrick and the animals are free.]
Patrick: Huh? [cheers with the other animals]
Gary: [softly] Meow! Shhh!
[Patrick and the animals stop cheering. They all slither to the officer. Gary peeks in the office and sees Marvin feeling sad.]
Gary: Hmm?
Marvin: Oh, Marvin, you can catch every snail in Bikini Bottom, but the only thing you've really caught is loneliness. [cries and coughs] And kennel cough.
Gary: [sadly] Meow.
Sandy: Marvin here ain't kith nor kin to Gary, but that don't matter none. Gary could never bear to see anyone looking so down.
Marvin: [blows his nose through a tissue] I need another snot rag. [leaves his office]
[Gary turns to Patrick and the other animals and tells them about Marvin's problem. Patrick and the animals look at each other in worry. Marvin comes back in the office with another tissue and blows his nose in it.]
Marvin: Hey! How did you animals get out?
[Gary, Spot and the animals suddenly appear dressed up in fancy clothes and playing smooth jazz music. One worm slithers up to Marvin.]
Marvin: Wh—wh—what's going on?
[The worm takes Marvin to the table and sets him down on the chair. Patrick comes in and holds out a can of generic snail food.]
Patrick: Et voilà. [opens the can with his teeth and pours the food on his plate]
[Gary spits out some slime and forms it into a beautiful woman.]
Marvin: [gasps] She's beautiful.
[Marvin falls in love with the slime woman and takes her on a date to Glove World!. They both ride the roller coaster, but the slime hits the people in back of them, much to the disgust. Then they both have a caricature draw a picture of them.]
Marvin: Oh! That's so good!
[Sometime later, Marvin and the slime woman he called Alice are having a wedding at the animal shelter.]
Marvin: I do. [kisses Alice]
[Patrick, the animals and the wedding attendees cheer happily.]
Marvin: I can't thank you all enough. You brought love into my lonely life. Everybody's free to go. [opens the front door]
[Patrick and the animals happily run out.]
Patrick: [laughs] Why am I running?
[Gary and Spot both slither out and head back to the Chum Bucket.]
Sandy: With their friends rescued, it's time for our boys to finally get some shut eye.
[Spot licks Gary, climbs up to the restaurant's sign and waves goodbye to Gary before going back in. Gary turns and heads back to SpongeBob's house. Upon arriving there, he sees Squidward grumbling to himself while he's picking up the trashy mess Gary and Patrick made.]
Gary: Meow?
[Gary slithers back into SpongeBob's house and climbs back into the bed, pushing the slime decoy away. He then slithers into SpongeBob's arms and goes to sleep.]
Sandy: After his long night of adventuring, Gary is more tired than a bronco on busting day.
[Just then, the alarm clock goes off.]
SpongeBob: [wakes up and gasps] Come on, Gary, you lazybones. It's time to wake up.
[Gary wakes up and gives SpongeBob a friendly smile.]
SpongeBob: Oh, well, maybe a few more minutes wouldn't hurt. [goes back to sleep with Gary]
Sandy: Well, that's the long and short of it. See y'all next time for more true to life tales of Bikini Bottom.
Gary: Shh!
[Sandy groans and the screen turns black, ending the episode.]


[Episode starts with Gary watching TV]
Monica: Help! Help!
Pirate: [Laughs heartily when a heart-shaped box of chocolates is thrown at him. He groans and faints]
Brad: Monica!
Monica: [gasps] Brad! [She and Brad run up to each other and hug]
Brad: Oh, Monica, I've thought I might never find you. [Gary's eyes brim with tears] I promise to never leave you at your side.
Monica: Oh, Brad.
Brad: Oh, Monica. [Gary is about to cry when SpongeBob turns off the TV]
SpongeBob: Do you know what today is, little guy?
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: It's take Gary a walk in a park day!
Gary: [uninterested] Meow.
[Gary is about to slither away when SpongeBob leashes him and takes him for a walk. Scene cuts to the Snail Park where all the other snails live. SpongeBob and Gary walk in.]
SpongeBob: Isn't this great, Gary? A whole park full of your own species. [Gary sees all the other snails are bored] Go ahead, have a good time. [he sees the two owners sleeping on a bench and SpongeBob walks and sits down between them] I'll just sit down for a sec. [falls asleep with the two owners. Gary sees the two other snails on the swing feeling bored then he sees one snail about to climb up the ladder where the slide is next to and falls down bored, and Gary sees the seesaw where a little snail named 'Mary' is on. Gary's eyes turn into hearts and slither to the other side of the seesaw. Mary sees Gary who is falling in love with her.]
Gary: [to Mary] Meoooow.
Mary: [to Gary] Meooow. [Gary and Mary are sea sawing up and down. Suddenly someone flips Gary on the seasaw in mid-air]
Gary: MREOOOW REOOOOW REOOOW REOOOW! OOF! [A snail slithers up to Gary]
Snail Boss: Hey, lightweight! What do you think you're doing with my girl? [to Mary] Come on, Mary, let's go.
Mary: Mreoooow. [Slithers next to Gary who smiles at her]
Snail Boss: [to Gary] You've just made a big mistake, pal.
Gary: Grrrrr... [both growl at each other when SpongeBob picks Gary up]
SpongeBob: Say goodbye to your friends, Gary! Play time's over! I've gotta fix us some dinner! [walks off with Gary in his hands]
Gary: [to Mary] Meoooow.
Mary: [to Gary] Meoooow. [Mable walks up and picks up Mary]
Mable/Monica: Let's go, Mary. [walks off]
Snail boss: Hey, this ain't over, runt! When I get through with yous, the doctor won't know which side to sow your lips back on... to! [two of the other angry snails slither up to their leader of the snail gang] That little runt is going to get what's coming to him! [scene cuts to SpongeBob making seaweed noodle stew in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Mmm-mmm! Seaweed noodle stew. [Scene scrolls over to Gary drawing a picture of Mary. It depicts a snail looking like Gary with lipstick]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [sets the seaweed noodle stew on the drawing of Mary] Bon appetit, Gary. I made it with extra love. [Gary sees the seaweed noodle stew, which turns into a sculpture of Mary. Gary kisses the seaweed noodle stew] Not exactly what I had in mind, but, eh... knock yourself out. [walks off to his room getting ready for bed. Gary keeps on kissing the seaweed noodle stew and stops]
Gary: [Sighs sadly and meows. Scene cuts to SpongeBob doing touching his toes]
SpongeBob: One, two. One, two. One, two.[Gary slithers in SpongeBob's room looking sad] One, two. One, two. One, two. One-oh. There you are. That sure was a knockout dinner, eh?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary, it's time for beddy-bye! [sets Gary on the newspapers which are beds, then to Gary] Night-night, Gare-Bear.
[SpongeBob turns off the lights and he and Gary fall asleep. Inside of Gary's head, he dreams about him and Mary playing on a see-saw. Mary slithers toward Gary and they both kiss with their lips when the dream ends. Gary wakes up from his dream. Gary carefully slithers out of SpongeBob's house to go find Mary. The next morning, the foghorn alarm goes off and SpongeBob wakes up with a smile, he yawns]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary! [notices that Gary is not there] Hmm? Where is he? Oh, he's probably using his snail box. It was a pretty noodly stew he ate last night. [goes over to the guest room where the litter box is] Peek-a-boo! [notices that Gary is not there either] Huh? Not in here either. [goes down the stairs into the kitchen] Gary? Where are you? [Notices an empty plate of seaweed noodle stew] I am gonna teach that snail how to clean up after himself. [picks up the plate and notices a picture of Mary that Gary drew] What's this? Some sort of ransom note? [examines Gary's drawing] Holy Neptune! My Gary has been petnapped by a deranged snail-lover! [He goes outside to save Gary] Don't worry, Gare-Bear, I'll save you! [scene cuts to Gary slithering toward the Snail Park where all the other snails are. He looks in a pipe]
Gary: Meow? [Gary then sees a silhouette of a girl snail on a slide. He rushes to meet her, but it is a different snail]
Elderly snail: [low voice] Meeooooooooow...
Gary: Meow reow. [slithers away. The snails #1, 2, and 3 arrive at a hole in the gate]
Snail boss: After me, fellas. [They slither into the Snail Park underneath the gate hole]
Bully snail: [struggles to get through the gate hole since the spikes on top of his shell are getting in the way] Hey, how come we never go through the front, guys?
Snail Boss: 'Cause the bad guys don't never use the front door!
Bully snail: [gets through the gate hole] Well, I think that that's pretty ridiculous. [they slither toward the other snails who are playing and doing stunts]
Snail Boss: [to all the other snails] All right. Listen up! Any of you seen a snail come through here? About a... yay tall, a shell, couple of eyes? [all the other snails don't understand]
Bully snail: I think you need to be more descriptive.
Snail Boss: Oh, okay, let's see here. Uh, this particular snail thinks it's real funny to make goo-goo eyes on my girl. [All the other snails laugh and continue playing and doing stunts] Hey! What-- they's giggling at! They's giggling at me! Alright, that's it! You's all going on my list! You's got that? You're all on the list! [they slither off through the gate hole, but the snail with spikes is stuck again and can't get through. He then struggles and sighs. Scene cuts to SpongeBob looking for Gary]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary? Where are you, buddy? [Stops and slides on some trail of snail slime that he sees and gasps] Snail slime! Looks like it could be Gary's. [touches the snail smile with his finger] Sounds right. Consistency matches. Now for the true test. [he licks it] Uh-huh. It is Gary's slime. I'm on the trail, Gary! [Follows Gary's snail slime. Scene cuts to Gary slithering on the sidewalk looking for Mary and her owner. He slithers through dozens of snails with their owners. They all stop and look both ways and a dozen of worms and their owners walk by. Gary continues slithering on and sees Mary with her owner. He slithers toward her while all the other snail and worm owners go across the street. Gary sees Mary and her owner walking in towards the pet store and follows inside when he bumps into the pet store owner "Harold"]
Harold: [picks up Gary] Why, hello there, little fellow. Are you a stray? [sets Gary in a cage] There now. Isn't that better?
Gary: [to Harold, sadly] Meow reow. [Gary sees Mary leaving outside the pet store with Mable. A few seconds later, the three angry snail gang members slither inside the pet store and Gary hides in his shell. The three snail gang members slither towards Harold and asks where Gary is]
Snail Boss: Meow meow meow meow?
Harold: No. No, I haven't seen any stray snails come in here.
Snail Boss: [to the other two angry snails] He's trying to pull a fast one, fellas. [smiles evily] Why don't we give him a taste of our special brand of swift justice?!
Narrator: Two hours later... [the pet store is shown to be all broken and torn inside from the three angry snail gang members who wrecked it. Harold sits there, scared]
Snail Boss: Heh! That's enough, boys. I've think we've done a thorough job.
Bully snail: Yeah. Let's get back to finding that snail. [whacks the cash register next to Harold. An orange snail with a red cap on sees the sale cage which is not broken]
Dan: Hey, Boss, there's one left.
Snail Boss: Oh yeah? [slithers towards the cage with a bat] I know you're in there, you little runt! [Breaks the sale cage with the bat, revealing a large green vicious worm]
Vicious Worm: [barks loudly]
Snail Boss: YAAAAH! [Worm attacks him]
Dan and Bully snail: HAAAAH! [run for their lives out of the store]
Snail Boss: AHH! MOMMY! MOMMY! [Gary escapes and Harold spots him]
Harold: You! [Gary keeps running] Come back here! You're gonna help me clean this place up! [Gary slithers out of the broken pet store, then Harold talks to himself] You brought this on yourself, Harold. I did not, Harold. Yes, you did, Harold. Harold, I did not. [Gary slithers quickly across the street when a car pulls up. It is revealed to be Mable and Mary inside the car and Mable honks the horn]
Mable/Monica: Come on, move it! [Gary sees Mary and his eyes google and hearts floats around] Get out of the road! [drives around Gary and drives away. Gary is about to go after her when the two angry snail gang members show up and grab Gary's tail]
Bully snail: Where do you think you're going? [Gary sees and hears Mary meowing for help. Dan and the Bully snail try to grab Gary]
Bully snail: Get' em!
Dan and Bully snail: [Gary jumps out of the way which causes them to hit each other and their eyestalks get tangled. They try to get free when they see Gary come up galloping and jumping into them. Their eyestalks become tangled and Gary catapults himself into the air. Gary is flying in mid-air then he notices that he cannot fly. Gary falls into the car and lands on the driver's head, which the driver screams and drives crazy. Gary jumps into Mable's car and lands safely into the back of the car seat and slithers towards Mary]
Gary: [to Mary] Meoooow.
Mary: [to Gary] Meooow. [SpongeBob finally stops and sees Gary and Mary inside Mable's car]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary?! [Gary and Mary meow at each other happily when Mable sees Gary in her car and gasps]
Mable/Monica: What the? [parks the car and SpongeBob crashes into the motor] What do you think you're doing in my car? No free rides, loafer! [picks up Gary when SpongeBob finally finds them]
SpongeBob: [to Mable] Hold it right there! Hands off my Gary, you snailnapper!
Mable/Monica: Snailnapper? [gets out of the car and puts down Gary] I don't want your dumb ol' snail.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. I suppose he wandered out of the house in the middle of the night just so he can jump into your car.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Not now, Gary, I'm scolding. And I suppose... Wh-wha-what?
Gary: Meow meow meow meow. Meow.
SpongeBob: You did wander out of the house on your own? But why? [Mary comes slithering next to Gary and SpongeBob sees Gary and Mary purring at each other happily] Oh, I see why. Good ol' fashioned amore! [Just then, the Boss snail catches up to Gary]
Snail Boss: Hey! This ain't over yet, runt! [The two snails start growling at each other when Brad shows up from the TV show that Gary was watching.]
Brad: Monica? Monica!
Mable/Monica: [gasps] Brad! [The two run to each other and hug]
Brad: Oh, Monica, I've thought I've never find you, Monica. I was just taking Billy here for a walk. [A handsome snail named "Billy" appears next to Brad. Mary turns around and slithers towards Billy]
Mary: [To Billy] Meoooow.
Billy: [to Mary] Meow. [the two snails keep growling at each other and stop to see that Mary and Billy are together and in love]
Snail Boss: Huh?
Gary: Meow?
Brad: I promise to never again leave your side. Let's go get a steaming hot cup of joe. [the two start to walk off with their snails]
Mable/Monica: Oh, Brad.
Brad: Oh, Monica.
SpongeBob: That's gotta hurt, Gary.
Gary: Meow reow.
Snail Boss: [smiles then to Gary] Eh. Come on, runt, I'll show you this great dumpster where we can get some seaweed noodle stew!
Gary: [smiles] Meow! [He and the Snail Boss slither off toward the dumpster]
SpongeBob: Don't stay out too late, Gary! [sighs happily] They grow up so fast.


[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Gary doing their morning exercises. SpongeBob stretches his legs really long and Gary stretches his eyestalks. They lose their balance and fall over.]
SpongeBob: Okay, that's enough stretching.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Now we're ready for a morning jog.
Gary: Meow!
[SpongeBob puts the leash on Gary's snail and goes to walk him. But Gary pulls him back and crashes into SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Gary? Don't you like jogging?
Gary: Meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, right. You're a snail. Hm. We've got to find a way to get you moving.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob creating a tank for Gary to ride on.]
SpongeBob: [picks Gary up] This should do it. [places Gary on the tank] You'll "tank" me later. [laughs]
[SpongeBob jogs in place and the tank begins to move. Then they both proceed their morning jog.]
SpongeBob: Hey, now you're moving.
[Suddenly, the tank malfunctions and begins to drive out of control.]
Gary: Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: [gets run over by the tank] Whoa—ow! [appears flattened and injured] I'm okay. [gets run over again] Ow! [gets run over again] Ow! [gets run over again] Yow!
[The tank repeatedly runs over SpongeBob until he is completely flattened. The tank crashes into the lamppost, sending Gary flying.]
Gary: Meow! [lands upside-down on his shell]
[Gary tries to get himself up, but fails. SpongeBob pulls out a sponge-shaped cookie cutter and cuts himself free. He then rushes over to Gary.]
SpongeBob: Aww, poor Gary. [picks up Gary] Looks like you could use a leg up. [comes up with an idea] Or maybe two.
[Gary whimpers in worry. The scene changes to SpongeBob making something out of wood with some wood-carving tools.]
SpongeBob: [removes goggles] There! A perfect set of legs. [reveals to have made a wooden table as he blows the wood dust off] Now let's make some for you.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob wearing a doctor's mask and Gary is on the operating table.]
SpongeBob: This will only hurt for a second. [pulls his legs off] Yow! [reproduces new legs and pushes the button to activate the table]
Gary: [flies upward] Meow! [lands on his shell and SpongeBob places the legs underneath Gary] Meow.
SpongeBob: [kicks the table away and sets Gary down] Voilà! What do you think, Gary?
Gary: [looks at his new legs] Me—ow, meow—meow.
SpongeBob: Let's try 'em out. Come on. Come to SpongeBob.
Gary: Hm. [struggles to walk, but is having a hard time]
SpongeBob: Oh, your first steps.
Gary: Meow. [nearly falls over but continues to walk]
SpongeBob: My little guy's growing up. [catches Gary after successfully walking to him] Now let's try something a little harder.
[SpongeBob bends his legs up and down. Gary does the same. SpongeBob does some kicks with his legs.]
Gary: [does some kicks with his new legs] Meow, meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Ooh, not bad. Try this. [performs an Irish jig]
Gary: [performs an Irish jig with his new legs] Meow, meow, meow, meooow!
SpongeBob: Nice moves. [does the Irish jig with Gary, but ends up getting his feet tangled] Ow! [falls over] Ah! [gasps] The student has surpassed the master.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob preparing another walk with Gary to show off his new legs.]
SpongeBob: Ready to stretch your stuff, Gare-bear?
Gary: Meow, meow. [begins running with his new legs] Meow!
SpongeBob: Hey, wait! [gets dragged by Gary] Whoa!
Gary: Meow, meow. [stops at the gate of the snail park]
SpongeBob: Oh! [flips over and backward] Oy. [gets himself up and removes Gary's leash] After you.
Gary: Meow, meow.
[SpongeBob and Gary enter the snail park. As they wonder around, the people and their pets look in awe at Gary's new limbs. They had never seen a snail with legs before.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, that's right. You're not dreaming. Check it out. Snail with legs, people.
[SpongeBob and Gary walk up to Ms. Mildred and her snail.]
Gary: Meow. [winks at Ms. Mildred's snail and growls flirtatiously]
[Ms. Mildred's snail purrs daintily.]
Bikini Bottomites: Would you look at that. Well, that's certainly different.
[A worm looks at Gary's new legs and sniffs at them. Gary hisses angrily and the worm barks back at the legged snail. Gary kicks the worm with his new legs and sends the worm flying over to its owner, who gets really angry.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Gary!
Worm owner: Hey, control your snail, fella!
SpongeBob: Sorry. Guess Gary's new legs got him a little excited.
[The worm blows a raspberry at Gary.]
Gary: [hisses angrily and kicks the worm and its owner with his new legs] Pow!
Worm owner: You'll be hearing from my lawyer! [pops in the sky]
[The other people and their pets see this and get really angry.]
Bikini Bottomites: What is your problem, man?
[Just when the people and their pets are about to attack them, Gary uses his new legs to kick them. Gary goes to attack the other people with his new legs.]
SpongeBob: Oh, wh—s—sorry!
[Everyone runs out of the snail park in fear.]
Fred: His legs!
SpongeBob: Gary the snail, that was very naughty!
Gary: [licks SpongeBob's hand] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh. [laughs] I can't stay mad at you. [pets Gary and puts the leash back on his shell]
Gary: [runs off with his new legs] Meow!
SpongeBob: [gets pulled forward] Whoa!
[Gary pulls SpongeBob really hard until he reaches to the pineapple house's front door. SpongeBob collapses from exhaustion.]
SpongeBob: [tries to open the door, but is too tired] I'm a little beat, Gary. Can you give me a hand with the door?
Gary: Meow—ow. [tries to open the door, but ends up getting his eyestalks tangled]
SpongeBob: Looks like I should give you a hand, huh?
[The scene changes to SpongeBob examining Gary with a measuring tape.]
SpongeBob: Hm? Hm. Hmm. [produces two extra arms for Gary] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [takes the arms] Yow! [breaks them apart and sticks them onto Gary] They look a little tight in the shoulder.
Gary: [looks at his new arms] Meow—meow, meow—meow. [points out that SpongeBob gave him two left-handed arms]
SpongeBob: Whoops! I accidentally gave you two left hands. [pulls the pinky and makes it into the perfect right hand] Boop! Perfect. Give 'em a test drive, Gary.
Gary: [struggles to move his new arms] Meow, meow, meow... [his arms fall downward; he tries to pull them up, but they're too heavy]
SpongeBob: Maybe you just need some motivation. [holds out a can of snail food]
Gary: Meow. [struggles to move his new arms to reach for the can of snail food, but squeezes SpongeBob's eyes by accident] Meow!
SpongeBob: [yelps in pain] You're doing it, Gary. Yes, yes! Keep it up, keep it up! [get slapped in the face by Gary's new arms] Ow! Yes, yes!
Gary: [slaps SpongeBob's face] Meow!
SpongeBob: That's it, Gary. [gets slapped again] Move the— [gets slapped again] Move the— [gets slapped again] Move those arms.
[The scene changes to Gary trying out various things with his new arms.]
Gary: Meow—ow—ow—ow—ow—ow. [flips the light switch on and off; then he goes to open the front door and sees Patrick] Meow? [slams the door before Patrick could say anything] Meow.
[Gary happily runs up and down the stairs while carrying SpongeBob and laughing. Gary then feeds SpongeBob some food in the kitchen. He imitates a train sound before stuffing SpongeBob's mouth with the food. SpongeBob talks to Gary with his mouth full. He points out the he can't chew his food on his own.]
Gary: [annoyed] Meow. [moves SpongeBob's mouth up and down to help him chew the food]
French Narrator: One Weekend of Pampering Later...
[SpongeBob is shown resting on the couch with a blanket. Gary gives SpongeBob a cup of hot chocolate and sits next to him to watch some television. Suddenly, SpongeBob's head starts to shake.]
SpongeBob: Ow! [sticks out his tongue and sees an alarm clock ringing] Yikes! Look at the time! I gotta get to the Krusty Krab. [throws the clock away] Thanks for spoiling me, Gary. I didn't have to lift a "finger." [pulls the blanket off and sees his own limbs old and worn out] My fingers... [goes to walk]  Wha—! [but falls over] A whole weekend of pampering has left my limbs in limbo. [drags across the floor with his tongue] Got. To go. To work. [crawls over to the front door and sees his hat] Hm? [tries to reach it, but falls over; his limbs wither and curl up, leaving SpongeBob completely motionless] Too weak to flip Krabby Patties. [whimpers]
[Gary walks over to SpongeBob. He takes pity on poor SpongeBob for having his limbs become worn out from all the pampering.]
Gary: [sympathetically] Ooh. Uh-oh.
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab. The customers are eating their patties, but they find snail slime on them, much to their disgust. One customer eats it, but becomes grossed out. He walks over to Mr. Krabs.]
Customer #1: Excuse me, but I would like to complain!
Mr. Krabs: I see. Well, the Krusty Krab takes customers feedback very seriously, sir. After they pay the $5.00 complaint fee.
Customer #1: All right, fine. [reluctantly gives Mr. Krabs $5.00]
Mr. Krabs: Yee—hee—hee—hee. [turns his head and places the dollar in it] Thank you, sir. Now what seems to be your problem?
Customer #1: There is slime on my patty!
Customer #2: And mine has—[eats his slime-covered patty] slime on it, too.
Sheldon: My patty doesn't have enough slime! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What? Give me that. [eats the slime-covered patty, but spits it out] Bleh! Ugh! Gah! SpongeBob! Just what do you think you're doing [enters the kitchen] changing me patty... [sees Gary at the grill] formula?
Gary: [tips his hat] Meow. Meow—mow. [flips patties but leaves a mess of slime]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Why is there a mollusk cooking me Krabby Patties?
Squidward: I thought it was strangely quiet and peaceful today.
Mr. Krabs: Where the halibut is SpongeBob?
Squidward: Maybe he quit? Or got hit by a bus?! Or caught a terminal disease!
Mr. Krabs: I don't care if he turned into a bucket of chum. I need me fry cook! [leaves to go check on SpongeBob] Mr. Squidward, you have the helm. [exits the restaurant]
Squidward: [speaks through megaphone] Attention Krusty Krab customers: Get out. It's time for my break.
[The customers leave the restaurant. Mr. Krabs knocks on the front door to SpongeBob's house.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Are you okay in there? You catch the flu or something? Ugh. Are you at death's door? Because you know darn well they ain't valid excuses to miss work! [peeks through the window and finds to his shocking surprise that SpongeBob is slithering on the floor with his tongue like a snail; SpongeBob eats some food from Gary's food bowl] Ah! SpongeBob has gone full raving loony. [hears something] Uh-oh! [hides underground as Gary appears]
Gary: ♪Meow—meow—meow—meow—meow—meow—meow. Meow—meow—meow—meow—meow—meow.♪ [enters the house]
[Mr. Krabs peeks through the window again. He sees SpongeBob rubbing his head against the chair while Gary's reading the paper. Gary pets SpongeBob and holds out a snail toy for him to play. SpongeBob plays the toy with his eye. Mr. Krabs gasps and drills himself inside through the floor.]
Gary: Meow?
Mr. Krabs: What in the name of Neptune's nostrils is going on in here?! SpongeBob, you're acting like you're the pet and that darn snail is the owner!
Gary: [hits Mr. Krabs with the toy] Meow! Meow—meow—meow.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the toy] Bad snail! Down boy! [gets attacked by SpongeBob] SpongeBob, what are you—[gets licked and pummeled by SpongeBob until he pushes him off and shakes him violently] Oh, snap out of it, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob doesn't respond. Mr. Krabs pulls out a Krabby Patty, breaks it in half and puts it under SpongeBob's nose. SpongeBob smells the patty's scent and shakes himself back to normal, snapping himself out of the strange trance.]
SpongeBob: [dazed] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Have you completely lost your mind, boy-o? Snails ain't supposed to have arms and legs.
SpongeBob: Aww, but Gary is so happy with his new limbs.
[Gary files his new arms.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, is he? Well, it's time to cut this nonsense! [growls and goes to fight Gary] Ay! [growls at Gary viciously] Huh-hah!
[Mr. Krabs leaps over to Gary and cuts the arms and legs, returning Gary back to his normal self.]
Gary: [sniffs the severed limbs] Meow. [slithers over to his food bowl, removes SpongeBob's name and goes to eat his food]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry I forgot who I was.
Mr. Krabs: That's okay, boy-o.
SpongeBob: And Gary, I am so sorry I tried to change you.
[Gary belches and proceeds to eat his food.]
SpongeBob: And Patrick, I'm sorry I haven't returned your hat yet. [shows an enormous hat with a train on it]
Patrick: [sobs quietly and hugs SpongeBob before getting his hat back] It's okay... [leaves]
SpongeBob: [sees the severed limbs walking away] Hm? [grabs a severed arm] Well, I guess I shouldn't let these go to waste. I can always use an extra hand [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] All right, all right. That's enough Sponge-bobbery for today, boy-o. [holds out the spatula] Time to get you flipping patties again. [leaves for the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob]
[The scene changes to nighttime and SpongeBob and Gary are getting ready for bed.]
SpongeBob: Ah, sure is nice having everything back to normal, isn't it Gare-bear? [climbs into bed] Yup. Same old, same old.
[After a brief silence, SpongeBob and Gary look at each other.]
Gary: Meow—ow. [slithers onto the bed while SpongeBob goes to sleep on the floor; they both sigh] Meow. Meow.
SpongeBob: Oops! Sorry. [his severed arms come out from under the bed and claps] Boop-boop.
[The lights turn off and the screen becomes black, ending the episode.]


Flying Dutchman: [Green fog passes by his ship while he steers his ship] Curse this cursed, ghostly fog. I can barely see past me own nose. [gas is sprayed in his eyes] Urrgh! [Screams after noticing the unseen cliff, only seen seconds after] [then the ship is split in half after it runs into a cliff. The Flying Dutchman falls down the cliff] Arrgh! [Continues falling, falling through a basketball hoop before hitting the ground. The ship falls onto of him into pieces then he crawls out] Me ship. [his ship turns into dust. His hat floats gently down, and he picks it up. He then gets out his cell phone to dial  the Roadside Assistance] Hello, Roadside Assistance? I've got a bit of a flat! My location where I'll be staying? Business or residence? [sees SpongeBob go into his house] Residence. [SpongeBob is walking through his house as The Flying Dutchman comes up and scares him through the floor] Argh!
SpongeBob: The Flying Dutchman! [melts into a puddle inside his pants] What are you doing in my house?
Flying Dutchman: I'm stuck here while my ship is being repaired. Until then, I'm here to haunt ya! [laughs maniacally, and ghostly snake "tongues" come out with evil grins. SpongeBob screams and runs to Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! [knocks on the door] Squidward! Help! [Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob continues to knock but on Squidward's face]
Squidward: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ee! Ow! Ee! Ooh!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob pants] Squidward, you have to help me! There's a gh-gh-gh, a ghost in my house!
Squidward: [muffled and grabs SpongeBob's arm] SpongeBob, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't believe in ghosts and I never liked you! [closes door]
SpongeBob: PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! [Patrick opens up his rock] Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch... [Patrick closes his rock] ...man. [Gary meows loudly] Gary! [opens his door and gasps] Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!
Flying Dutchman: Aw, I just wanted to pet the little guy. [SpongeBob shows teary eyes, then snaps out of it. Gary looks relaxed] There, there. Dutchie's not gonna hurt ya. I love me a good snail. [SpongeBob smiles sheepishly, the Flying Dutchman eats Gary.]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob screams and rips off the sides of his head]
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob looks down] Meow!
SpongeBob: [relieved and happy] Gary!
Flying Dutchman: [cackles] Nothing better than giving a good scare! Argh! [laughs]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Gary. [fire surrounds the Flying Dutchman and SpongeBob]
Flying Dutchman: [Talking scarily...] Don't get too comfortable! [cut to SpongeBob walking up to his house, which is set on fire, making it look like a monster house. His house makes an evil laugh. SpongeBob does not get scared, but he looks like he's upset. Cut to SpongeBob's bedtime]
SpongeBob: Goodnight, Gary. [They both sleep. Suddenly, his nose starts to itch so a yellow tentacle scratches it. SpongeBob pulls off his blanket to reveal him as an octopus. He screams while the Flying Dutchman laughs. Cut to SpongeBob opening up the refrigerator to a monster popping out and scaring him. Both laugh. Cut to SpongeBob looking in the mirror when in the reflection only, a monster eats him. He sighs and walks off. Cut to him eating cereal, which are eyeballs, and they blink. He sighs and walks off again]
Flying Dutchman: Hmm? [SpongeBob walks up and opens a drawer then sighs and takes out the skeleton in it. As he's walking out, a monster pops out from underneath the floor and tries to scare SpongeBob, but it doesn't. The monster turns into a giant cockroach, a baby, a clown, which laughs evilly in SpongeBob's face, then Sherlock Holmes, who smokes a pipe, then he spits it out and screams, and even SpongeBob's head. It then grimaces, and dozens of spiders come out, but still nothing is working. Dutchman's head pops out] Hmm?
SpongeBob: Um, Dutchie? Is this gonna be much longer?
Flying Dutchman: Why aren't you freakin' out, lad?
SpongeBob: Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks.
Flying Dutchman: What are you trying to say?
SpongeBob: Eeeh.
Flying Dutchman: I know when I'm washed up. I've been doing the same material for years! Scaring is a young man's game. It's time to give up the ghost; no pun intended.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all.
Flying Dutchman: Don't lie to me!
SpongeBob: You just gotta scare someone other than me.
Flying Dutchman: Hmm... [scene cuts to the Bikini Bottom Mattress Discount]
Fish: Mind if I test it out? [hops onto the mattress] Yeah, this does feel comfortable. [doorbell rings]
Mattress Salesman: Would you excuse me for a moment? [The fish on the mattress falls asleep as the Flying Dutchman tries to scare him. First he scares normally, then scares by opening his mouth to reveal a skeleton. Nothing is working]
Flying Dutchman: Grr! [Shakes the guy continuously] Raargh! Raargh! Move! Raargh! [Puts the guy back to his mattress] Ah, forget it. [Mattress Salesman comes back]
Mattress Salesman: So, what do you think? [the sleeping fish screams. Scene cuts to The Flying Dutchman trying to scare a little girl jumping rope. The jump rope hits him back]
Flying Dutchman: It's official; I'm not scary anymore.
SpongeBob: Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all.
Flying Dutchman: Maybe I just need a break. Take some time off, you know?
SpongeBob: Sure, relax a little.
Flying Dutchman: Maybe stay with a friend for a while. On a comfy couch in a pineapple. Just for a little while longer? 'Til I get back on my feet?
Narrator: 6 Months Later...
SpongeBob: [walks into his house] Hey, champ! How's it... [screams]
Red Ghost: Turn it up...
Purple Ghost: Turn the knob up.
Yellow Ghost: Whoo!
Flying Dutchman: Who'd guess we have so much in common? You like teddy bears; I like teddy bears. You like ponies; I like ponies!
Nancy: Is that a wedding ring?
Flying Dutchman: Oh, this? Oh, it's nothing. [takes it off and throws it away, landing on SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: What is going on around here?
Flying Dutchman: Come on, SpongeBob, don't be a stick in the mud!
Purple Ghost: Look out below! [riding on a motorcycle down the stairs and crashing into SpongeBob's wall] How was that?
Flying Dutchman: Even better the third time.
SpongeBob: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Everyone, get out!
Flying Dutchman: Alrighty, boys, party's over. [to Nancy] Time to scoot, honey. [everyone leaves, except SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman]
SpongeBob: Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?
Flying Dutchman: Well, it is comfy.
SpongeBob: Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!
Flying Dutchman: Ah, you're right, SpongeBob. I'm pathetic.
SpongeBob: Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now. [SpongeBob puts a tape into the VCR]
Flying Dutchman: What in barnacles is it?
SpongeBob: A journey into self-awareness. [on the tape is a fish that uses a square hammer on a gong. An eagle flies through some mountains and calls out. Then some fish, wearing robes and roller skating, skate in a straight line]
Fish: The power within. The power within. [last fish holds a medallion up]
Fish #2: [whispering] The power within. The power within. The power within. The power within. [the man multiples into a blue, red, and green being of himself] The power within. The power within. [picks up some dirt] The power within! Yeah.
Flying Dutchman: That was beautiful!
SpongeBob: Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious. [cut to later that night where an elderly fish lady is walking by some seaweed, where SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman are hiding behind] Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there?
Flying Dutchman: What are you kidding me? Scaring her is too easy.
SpongeBob: Now that's the Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action.
Flying Dutchman: No problemo, compadre. [thunder claps while the Dutchman screams at the old lady] Yargh!
Old Lady: Lonnie is that you?
Flying Dutchman: What? No! 'Tis I, the ominous Flying Dutchman! [screams]
Old Lady: Lonnie, there's this great new product called toothpaste. I think you should try it. [cut to SpongeBob flying on the Flying Dutchman's back. They spot a gym]
Flying Dutchman: Let's hit it. [The Flying Dutchman, goes through the wall, but SpongeBob does not, smashing into the wall. Inside, Larry the Lobster is lifting weights. Then he looks into the mirror]
Larry: Dude, look at your pecks! You're phenomenal! Truly a hard body. Look at those guns. [Flying Dutchman attempts to scare him. Larry gasps]
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Now he's got him.
Larry: My latissimus dorsi has gone flabby! I gotta get to a rolling machine. [leaves]
Flying Dutchman: Ah. It's no use, SpongeBob. I can't seem to scare anyone. Maybe people just don't believe in ghosts anymore.
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems! [whispers into the Flying Dutchman's ears] ...goblins...guilt trip... [scene cuts to Squidward's house where Squidward slips into his bunny slippers and walks to the mirror. When he picks up his powder, it floats by itself and applies itself onto Squidward.]
Squidward: Huh? [Green fog begins to appear and a voice is heard in the fog]
Mrs. Tentacles: Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: What's going on?
Mrs. Tentacles: Why haven't you called me?
Squidward: Mother?
Mrs. Tentacles: Why haven't you called your mother?
Squidward: [screams] Uh, Squiddums loves his mama.
Mrs. Tentacles: Why don't you call me then? Why don't you call me? Why don't you call me? [her face melts turning into a clarinet that plays music. The clarinet goes into one of Squidward's ears and out the other, literally]
Flying Dutchman: [through the clarinet] I heard you don't believe in ghosts!
Squidward: Ghosts?
Flying Dutchman: As in the Flying Dutchman! [tosses Squidward against the wall]
Squidward: There's no such thing as ghosts. No such thing.
Flying Dutchman: No such thing as ghosts? No such thing as ghosts?! You don't believe in ghosts?! [floor turns into liquid. Another ghost pops up and eats Squidward sending him into a light that spits him back into his house. A giant SpongeBob is sitting there breathing in and out really hard]
Squidward: SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's eyes twist around his head and spiders crawl out and reveal the Flying Dutchman. Flying Dutchman does a trick to think that he is pulling his finger off]
Flying Dutchman: Ooh, scary!
Squidward: No! No! That's impossible! [runs out of his house] Ghosts! Ghosts!
SpongeBob: [runs out of the closet] Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!
Flying Dutchman: And me confidence, too. Now I feel like I can scare the living criminy out of anybody! All thanks to you, my boy.
SpongeBob: And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.
Flying Dutchman: Actually, I have a confession, SpongeBob. My ship's been done for three months now. Well, it was nice roomin' with ya. [flies back up to his ship] Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I left you a little something something for all your trouble. Now, it's time for me to ruin more souls. [ships sails off. SpongeBob opens the package. A hand grabs him and pulls him in. SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Good Ol' Dutchie!


Squidward: [is asleep in bed when his alarm wakes him up. He puts on his slippers, gets out of bed, walks to the mirror, pulls up his shirt by his collar, licks his finger, and rubs his eyebrows] Squidward, my man, you are perfect! [Squidward is walking outside with a watering can to water his kelp garden, but it's wilted] Oh, no, my kelp garden is all wilted! Don't worry, fellas, I've got just the thing to perk you up. [pulls out a spray bottle] Kelp Grow! Hold still. [Squidward sprays it, and his kelp stands up and sprouts yellow flowers. Squidward sniffs it, then notices Patrick inside]
Patrick: They're pretty.
Squidward: [screams] Patrick?
SpongeBob: And SpongeBob!
Squidward: What are you two doing here?
SpongeBob: Patrick is helping me to do good deeds today, like trimming your kelp garden.
[Patrick eats some of Squidward's kelp and burps loudly]
Squidward: Stop eating my kelp! [pushes Patrick away from his garden]
Patrick: Okay, okay, jeez. Try to help a fella out. [pulls an ice cream cone out of his pocket] I'll just have to eat this ice cream cone instead.
Squidward: Oh, do you like to eat ice cream, Patrick?
Patrick: [thinks] Yeah.
Squidward: Then have some more! [Squidward sprays the ice cream with kelp grow, and it grows more. Patrick falls from the extra weight. Squidward laughs] Still want that ice cream?
Patrick: Boy, I do! Thanks, Squidward. Want some, SpongeBob? Last one to the cone is a rotten clam! [both start licking it]
Squidward: Are you done yet?
Patrick: [after eating the ice cream cone] All done.
SpongeBob: Wow, I wish I had a bottle of that kelp grow stuff. [Patrick takes Squidward's bottle and gives it to SpongeBob]
Patrick: Here you go, SpongeBob.
Squidward: Hey!
SpongeBob: Thank you, Patrick. You know, my shoes feel kinda tight. [SpongeBob sprays them, and they become bigger] Huh, nice and roomy. [hands the bottle to Patrick]
Patrick: Do you want your grow juice back?
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, no, I only paid for it. I wouldn't want to deprive you of it.
Patrick: Okay.
Squidward: Give me that!
Patrick: But you said you didn't want it.
Squidward: Fine! Why don't you two use it for your good deeds?
SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Squidward!
Patrick: Yeah, I'll go first. [Patrick sprays Squidward's nose, and it becomes bigger]
Squidward: [screams] What did you do?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!
Patrick: Quite an improvement, don't you think?
SpongeBob: Oh, yes, I agree completely. Come on, Patrick, let's do some good deeding!
Patrick: Yay! [they run off]
Squidward: Hey, get back here, [chases after them] and fix my nose! [SpongeBob and Patrick run up to Gary]
SpongeBob: Hey, Gary, that shell of yours looks a little cramped.
Gary: Meow. [goes inside his shell. SpongeBob sprays his shell, and it becomes bigger]
SpongeBob: There, now you've got plenty of space. [they run off, then Squidward runs on screen, and notices Gary's large shell]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Aha, they went this way.
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Squidward: [understanding of it] Oh, tell me about it. [walks away]
Gary: Meow. [pants. He tries to move, but it's hard with his big shell. Bubbles rise up, transitioning to SpongeBob and Patrick behind a rock]
SpongeBob: [talking about Mr. Krabs, who is throwing a penny in the air] There he is.
Patrick: Get ready.
SpongeBob: Now, Patrick! [Patrick sucks him into his belly button, then spits him out. He then sprays Mr. Krabs' penny, and it turns bigger, and crushes Mr. Krabs] There you go, Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make "big money." [cuts to scene of live people groaning. Now talking to Patrick] Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward.
Patrick: You're a saint, SpongeBob! A saint!
SpongeBob: I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But time's a wasting! We need another good deed!
Patrick: Oh, I got one! Um...you know that thing?
SpongeBob: Um, right, that thing that we did that day.
Patrick: No, the other one. Um... [both think, then Squidward walks on screen]
Squidward: SpongeBob! [pants and hits SpongeBob’s head] Hey! Look at what you did to me. You better fix my nose, or you'll hear from my lawyer!
SpongeBob: Are you sure?
Patrick: Yeah, you'd be ugly again.
Squidward: Yes, I'm sure!
SpongeBob: Hmm, how to fix his nose?
Patrick: What if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it will shrink it?
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's brilliant!
Squidward: No, wait, don't. [they spray his nose with the bottle upside down, and it gets bigger]
SpongeBob: That didn't work.
Patrick: Well, try it again.
SpongeBob: Hmm. I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head.
[SpongeBob sprays Squidward's head]
Patrick: Now his body is too small.
SpongeBob: Right, too small. [SpongeBob sprays it]
Patrick: Arms are too short. [SpongeBob sprays his arm] Legs are too short. [SpongeBob sprays Squidward's legs] Other arm. [SpongeBob sprays Squidward's other arm] Feet too small. [SpongeBob sprays Squidward's feet] Teeth! [SpongeBob sprays them] Belly button. [SpongeBob sprays it. Patrick blows a kiss] Perfect!
Squidward: [looks very ugly] I look horrible! [Squidward releases blue ink]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ew! [they cough] He inked!
Squidward: Well, pardon my anatomy! [Squidward gets even bigger] What's happening?
SpongeBob and Patrick: All right! [Squidward is bigger]
Squidward: What did you do to me?!
Patrick: I know! I know! Um, made you a monster!
SpongeBob: And a giant.
SpongeBob and Patrick: A giant monster!
Squidward: I don't want to be a giant lumbering monster! [picks up SpongeBob and Patrick] What will I do now?
SpongeBob: That's easy, play giant lumbering monster tag!
Patrick: Yeah! Yeah! You chase us!
SpongeBob: And we run around and scream like crazy! [he and Patrick slide out of Squidward's hand] Try and catch us, giant monster Squidward! [they run away from Squidward]
Squidward: SpongeBob, come back here! [chases them]
SpongeBob: [screams] This is really fun.
Patrick: [screams] I know. We should do this... [screams] ...more often. [they run into Bikini Bottom, screaming, when Squidward is chasing them]
Nancy: [screams] A monster! [grabs Monroe's arm and begins tugging it twice as if to start a segway, and runs away, riding Monroe like a segway]
Harold, Nat, Shubie, Sally, Nazz, and Sadie: [watch SpongeBob and Patrick running away, still screaming, Squidward's feet appears. A car drives out of the way] Monster!
Medieval Fish: Monster! [As the humanized fish walks out, villagers with torches and weapons form a mob to run for Bikini Bottom. They run past Squidward to kill him.]
Male Fish: Huh? [takes out a torch from his case, then chases Squidward. Squidward finally gets SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: You are very good at pretending, Squidward. Look how you're all sweaty and angry, and you got the whole town to play along. [Citizens with torches and pitchforks and rakes form a mob, surrounding Squidward.]
Squidward: What the?
Miss Shell: Kick him!
Canadian Fish: Let's get him and make back bacon!
Lifeguard: Scoop out his... eyeballs and use 'em as... giant... misshapen soccer balls!
[Taylor walks towards the mob.]
Taylor: Wait. Maybe he's a nice monster, like in my story book. [Tina and Sadie's torches extinguish.]
Lifeguard: Oh, right, I, I haven't thought of that. Well, are you?
SpongeBob: Oh, goodness gracious, yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all.
Patrick: Yeah! Squidward, tell them about all those times that you didn't punch me in the face.
SpongeBob: Even though you really wanted to.
Squidward: [yells] Oh, quiet, you moron!
[all gasp]
Nazz: He hurt the little one's feelings.
Shubie: Why, that's not very nice at all.
Lifeguard: [yells] Take him down, boys! [Following the lifeguard fish, the mob uses a giant rake slingshot to hit his foot.]
Squidward: Ow! [holds his foot and hops backwards. Harold, Scooter, Nazz, and Fred set up a giant rake behind him. Squidward steps on it and falls down after it hits him on the back of the head. The lifeguard comes up with a big tube of lipstick.]
Lifeguard: This oughta fix him. [puts lipstick on Squidward's lips]
[The mob stops yelling.]
Squidward: Okay, okay, I'm nice. [is shown to be tied to the ground with ropes] Now will you leave me alone?
Sadie: Oh, yeah? Then prove it! 
Lifeguard: Yeah! Are you nice enough to...? Um...
Nazz: Compliment me on my new hairdo?
Squidward: [sits up, breaking free from the ropes] Yeah, sure, whatever.
Nazz: [laughs] Oh, thank you.
Camp Councilor: Let the junior guppies camp out under your toenails? [we see fish sleeping under Squidward's toenails]
Skier: Take me to the top of Mount Humongous? [Squidward does it and the skier skis down Mt. Humongous] Whee...!
Farmer: Blow on my old windmill? [Squidward blows on a windmill]
Tyler: Do my homework?
Nat: Dust my attic?
Taylor: Feed my snail? [Squidward pants]
Shubie: Wow, this giant really is friendly after all.
Harold: He taught my grandmother how to read!
Lifeguard: He helped me start my own blimp ride company. [the blimp is really Squidward's nose]
Nat: He helped me build a... a... [sneezes]
All: [collectively] Bless you. Gesundheit. [Squidward says nothing as he did not hear Nat sneeze] Ahem?
Squidward: What?
[all gasp]
Evelyn: He didn't say bless you.
Lifeguard: Get him! [Squidward screams and runs away from the angry mob.]
Shubie: Where'd he go?
Lifeguard: Is that him over there?
Squidward: [visibly hiding behind a building] Uhh, I'm a lamppost?
Lifeguard: Oh. Well, let's go check down by the creek! We'll teach him to dip his feet! [Citizens run off while Squidward tiptoes away. Cuts to Squidward's house at night, where there is a big trap around it. Squidward touches his house, and the trap springs]
Squidward: Well, Squidward, I guess this is your new life. [cuts to Squidward on a mountain] And this is your new bed. [lays down] Good night, old life. [sobs] I'll miss you.
SpongeBob: Good night, Squidward.
Squidward: [sits up] Where are you?
SpongeBob: Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button. [he and Patrick are in the belly button under a blanket and using the lint as pillows]
Squidward: What the? Get out of there! [picks them out] You two have ruined my life! [starts sobbing. SpongeBob and Patrick exchange glances, then float away on a river of Squidward's giant tears]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him.
Patrick: So?
SpongeBob: We shall do him another. [cuts to SpongeBob's house the next day. Construction sounds can be heard behind a door with a sign saying "Keep Out."] We did it! [the roof opens up and a giant present that says "For Squidward" pops out. SpongeBob and Patrick leave the house and push the present over to where Squidward is sitting]
Squidward: What the?
SpongeBob: Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one. [Squidward opens it]
Squidward: A giant clarinet? [holds it up. SpongeBob and Patrick nod. Squidward plays it, then gasps] And it sounds divine! [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp excitedly. As Squidward plays, he shrinks back to normal size and falls to the ground] Now I'm too small to play my giant clarinet! [starts bawling. The clarinet falls and crushes him. SpongeBob and Patrick pull him out] It was the most beautiful thing I've ever played! [sighs] Well, at least I still have my kelp garden. [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh nervously] What? [cuts to where Squidward's kelp garden is cut down] You cut it down?
SpongeBob: We used your kelp to make a kelp-mâché clarinet. [Squidward gets angry, then begins to chase SpongeBob and Patrick. They scream, then laugh, then scream again]


[The episode begins with Sandy rounding up capturing some bacteria in her amoeba form.]
Sandy: [laughs] Yee-haw! Get along, little amoebas! [checks her watch] I did it! It's sarsaparilla time! [jumps out from her microscope, pushes the exit button and reverts back to her normal form] Holy osmosis! I lived as an amoeba for a whole week!
[Sandy jumps off her table, takes a vial and pours it on a speck, which forms into a telephone. Sandy dials the number and calls Karen at the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: [crushing a remote] Can't get it to work, can never get it to work! [yells indistinctly in the background]
Karen: [answers the phone] Hello?
Sandy: [pushes the screen to make room] Karen, my Mainframe! I just made a scientific breakthrough. Let's go and celebrate, girl!
Karen: I'm sorry, Sandy. I can't hear you because [turns to Plankton] someone can't shut up!
[Plankton stops yelling.]
Sandy: That's okay, Karen. I'll tell you all about it later. Let's meet up tonight at the corner café!
Karen: You got it, Bushy Tushy. I will definitely be there. [Sandy hangs up the phone] Okay, I'm off.
Plankton: Those are not my test tubes! [kicks some test tubes]
Karen: Ugh. Don't wait up.
Plankton: I don't know where they came from! [throws some more test tubes]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, who is once again trying to pass his boating exam with Mrs. Puff at her boating school.]
SpongeBob: [mutters excitedly] Whoa!
Mrs. Puff: [sighs] Don't forget to signal.
SpongeBob: [gets up and waves his arms] Oh, thanks for that, Mrs. Puff, I—[crashes into the wall and Mrs. Puff puffs up]
[Mrs. Puff deflates and her cellphone rings.]
Mrs. Puff: [answers her cellphone] Hello?
Sandy: [pushes the screen to make room] Howdy, Powder Puff! You wanna step out with me and Karen tonight?
Mrs. Puff: Oh, yes, Sandy! I desperately need to step out. [laughs and exits her boat]
SpongeBob: Ooh! You're talking to Sandy? Mrs. Puff, tell her I said, "Hi!" Tell her I said, "Hi!" Tell her I said, "Hi!"
Sandy: We'll all meet up at the corner café tonight. Get ready to party, y'all!
Mrs. Puff: Okay! See you soon!
SpongeBob: Tell her I said, "Hi!"
Sandy: [hangs up the phone and pulls the screen back up] Whoo.
SpongeBob: Tell her I said, "Hi!"
[Mrs. Puff exits the boating school and locks the gate. She hums as she walks until SpongeBob shows up.]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff! Tell her I said, "Hi!"
[Mrs. Puff frantically runs away from SpongeBob. The scene changes to Sandy, Karen and Mrs. Puff drinking hot chocolate at the corner café at night.]
Sandy: [gives Mrs. Puff and Karen a toast of their friendship] Yeah!
[Mrs. Puff and Karen get whipped cream on their faces and sigh. Sandy gets whipped cream on her face as well. But she sneezes it onto her helmet.]
Sandy: [licks the whipped cream] Y'all are never gonna believe what I did this week. It's about as crazy as a mule with a top hat!
Mrs. Puff: Was it crazier than this? [imitating SpongeBob] "Tell her I said 'Hi!'" "Tell her I said 'Hi!'" [mimics SpongeBob's laugh and falls over]
Sandy: Sorry you day was tough, Puff. But my news will cheer your head off. I lived as a microscopic organism for a whole week!
Karen: That's great, Sandy, but I've lived with a microscopic organism for 26 years and wait until you hear what that pipsqueak did today. He leaves his little telescope on the floor, [smacks Mrs. Puff by accident as she talks] I rolled over it. It hurt like heck! And then, he gets mad at me for breaking it. Doesn't even ask if my wheel's okay. [picks up her wheels to show that one of them is broken]
Mrs. Puff: [gets up] SpongeBob is the same way, Karen. After all these years of my trying to teach him how to drive, he doesn't know the first thing about a car! [pounds on the table] I'm going crazy!
[Both Karen and Mrs. Puff cry their tears off.]
Sandy: Hey, hey, hey, hey. We're supposed to be having a good 'ol time, not a good 'ol cry.
Mrs. Puff: [sniffs and stops crying] I'm having a good time.
Karen: [stops crying] Me too.
Sandy: Look, guys. This is a girls night out. And I'm gonna make sure we have more fun than three rats in a pickle barrel! [Karen and Mrs. Puff join hands with Sandy] Gal pals unite!
Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen: Yeah!
Karen: [her screen shows "Gal Pals" on it] Gal pals!
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket. Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and Karen are hiding in the dumpster.]
Karen: So, let me get this straight. Pranking Plankton will make me feel better?
Sandy: You bet your sweet software it will. Now let's get pranking.
[Sandy and Mrs. Puff dress up in a poorly made costume of Mr. Krabs. They come out of the dumpster, but the costume is making them lose their balance. Karen places the costume's head on them, takes out her microphone and imitates herself as Mr. Krabs.]
Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.
[Sandy and Mrs. Puff step up to the front door.]
Sandy: Ready? [throws a rock] Yah!
[The rock smashes through the window and hits Plankton.]
Plankton: Ouch! [peaks out the window and sees Mrs. Puff and Sandy in their disguise] Krabs?! If I wasn't on probation, I'd call the cops!
Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] Plank-ter-ren, me old nemesis-ser! [Sandy and Mrs. Puff's balloon eye on their disguise deflates, but they quickly fix it] I've got good news-erer: I'm leaving town and going back into the "Navery," so I'm giving you me secret formuler-er-rer! [the disguise's arm falls off]
Plankton: What? How do I know this isn't a trap-erer? Ah! You got me doing it!
Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] It's a going away gift-erer.
[Sandy and Mrs. Puff fall backwards and almost expose themselves. Karen slaps herself in embarrassment.]
Karen: [imitating Mr. Krabs via microphone] I'll get me formuler-er out of me safe-er-er-er and meet you at the Krusty Krab-er-er-er.
[Plankton's thought cloud shows Mr. Krabs giving Plankton the secret formula.]
Plankton: I'll meet you there, Eugene honey! [blow kisses] Kiss! [giggles]
Sandy: I think he bought it.
Karen: Psst! Come on!
Sandy and Mrs. Puff: Whoa-whoa! Wa-whoa! Whoa! [fall in the dumpster]
[Plankton comes out of the Chum Bucket, humming happily. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen giggle as Plankton enters the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: I'm here! [hums as he heads to the office where the formula is]
[Just then, the alarm goes off and the real Mr. Krabs arrives.]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You've interrupted me beauty sleep!
Plankton: Hey, Eugene. I'll just take the secret formuler-erer heh and be on my way.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls out a cannon] Over my dead body!
Plankton: [pulls out a ray gun] Whatever you say, Welcher!
[Mr. Krabs and Plankton begin a brawl inside the Krusty Krab. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen laugh together.]
Karen: Y'know, you're right, Sandy. I do feel so much better! [shows the word "Gal Pals" on her screen]
Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen: Gal pals!
[Mr. Krabs blasts Plankton out of the Krusty Krab and sends him flying off into the distance. The scene changes to Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen outside of SpongeBob's house.]
Mrs. Puff: I'm not so sure about pranking SpongeBob. He can't help he's insufferable.
Sandy: Nobody likes a good prank more than SpongeBob.
Mrs. Puff: Mm. Okay.
[Mrs. Puff takes out a ruler and unlocks the door. Sandy and Mrs. Puff sneak into SpongeBob's house while Karen stand outside as a look-out. Sandy and Mrs. Puff come back out with SpongeBob sleep on his bed's mattress. SpongeBob slides off the mattress and continues sleeping. Sandy then quietly slips a helmet on his head.]
Sandy: Virtual reality helmet, engaged.
[SpongeBob murmurs in his sleep and the girls laugh at him.]
Sandy: Shh, shh. All right, Karen. You're up.
[Karen turns on her screen and makes the sound of a doorbell ringing.]
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? C-coming!
[SpongeBob sees through the virtual reality helmet as sees his house. He walks up to Sandy and turns her as if he's opening the door. Then he sees Mrs. Puff as Norton.]
SpongeBob: Hello? Can I help you?
Mrs. Puff: [via Norton] Hello, Mr. SpongeBob. I'm just here to deliver your driver's license. [gives SpongeBob a card in order to fool him into thinking it's his driver's license] Congratulations.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, thanks—[gasps] My driver's license! [his "license" winks at him]
Mrs. Puff: [via Norton] And your new boat! [shows SpongeBob a shopping in order to fool him into thinking it's his boatmobile]
SpongeBob: My new boat! [jumps in his shopping cart] Whoa, wow! [mutters excitedly] Am I dreaming? [sees flying pineapples and a pterodactyl through the helmet] Nope, it's for real. [Sandy and Mrs. Puff shake the shopping cart to fool SpongeBob into thinking he's driving; Through the helmet, he sees bystanders waving at him. Including a talking banana] Look at me, everyone! I'm driving! I'm driving!
Mrs. Puff: [shudders] Oh! That voice. Yes, you're driving! You're driving me crazy! [gasps and laughs maliciously] I know! Let's make the road really bumpy!
[Mrs. Puff lifts up the shopping cart and crashes it back and forth while losing her sanity.]
SpongeBob: Wha-what? Whoa! [falls down] Whoa! Ow! [Mrs. Puff murmurs angrily] Hm, those are some potholes.
[Mrs. Puff breathes heavily from her insanity.]
Sandy: Whoa, girl! Easy there. Maybe it's about time we let SpongeBob in on the joke.
Mrs. Puff: [punches herself and calmly regains her sanity] Okay. I'll tell him. SpongeBob—[notices SpongeBob driving away] SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob laughs as he drives away in the shopping cart. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen scream and chase after SpongeBob. SpongeBob runs over a rock, spins and continues to drive. Sandy and Mrs. Puff ride onto Karen.]
Mrs. Puff: Poor little guy! This is all my fault!
Sandy: No, Puff! This is all my fault!
Karen: [her screen shows "Gal Pals" on it] Gal pals!
Sandy: Not now, Karen!
Karen: Sorry.
SpongeBob: [laughs and sees a crowd cheering for him through the helmet] Ooh, a turn. Better use my hand signals.
Sandy: SpongeBob! Look out!
[SpongeBob grabs onto a one way sign and swings the shopping cart the other direction. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen continue to follow him. As SpongeBob drives the shopping cart, he causes a major pile up on the road.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving. Hi, I'm driving! [laughs and waves the card around] Look, I got a license. [two boats collide and Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff emerge from the smoke; SpongeBob giggles] Whoo! Nothing but me and miles of road! [giggles as he is ending to a brick wall] near a construction site]
Sandy: We gotta stop this cart, gal pals!
[The background changes into red, orange, and yellow sunlights. Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen reach SpongeBob and grab onto the shopping cart.]
Mrs. Puff: Whoa! Whoa! [sees the brick wall saying the words, "Dead End"] I'll save you, SpongeBob!
[Mrs. Puff jumps onto SpongeBob and the shopping cart loses control. They crash through the brick wall and the all descend down into the construction site.]
SpongeBob: Now I'm flying! [sees clouds through the helmet] Whee!
[Sandy, Karen, and Mrs. Puff fall into the shopping cart as it hits the ground. Mrs. Puff inflates herself and SpongeBob lands safely on her. Mrs. Puff deflates her body.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Huh? Huh. [sees the cloud through the helmet and Mrs. Puff takes it off of his head] Huh? [Mrs. Puff laughs sheepishly] Mrs. Puff? Oh, I see. You guys played a prank on me, huh? I love pranks! [laughs] Thank you, thank you, thank you! You gave me a chance to live my driving dream. And most importantly...[hugs Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff saved my life! Now I will stay by your side forever! [laughs]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, no! No!
[SpongeBob flies around Mrs. Puff. Sandy grabs Mrs. Puff and the hop back onto Karen. They all run away from SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Oh, you girls got me again! [laughs, puts the helmet back on and moves around in midair] Vroom! Vroom!
Sandy: I know somewhere where we can finish our ladies night in peace.
[The scene changes to Sandy's treedome where Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen are seen as amoebas.]
Karen: [laughs] Good one. [laughs] This was a great idea, Sandy.
Mrs. Puff: Yeah, what a nice place to relax.
[Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen drink their hot chocolate and get whipped cream on their faces. They like off the whipped cream and sigh. All of a sudden, SpongeBob comes in as an amoeba.]
SpongeBob: Vroom, vroom! Honk, honk! Beep, beep! Oh, look at me, Mrs. Puff! I'm driving! [laughs]
[Then Plankton and Mr. Krabs come in as amoebas continuing their brawl over the Krabby Patty secret formula.]
Sandy, Mrs. Puff and Karen: [sighs] Men. [Karen shows her screen "Gal Pals" on it through the microscope lens] Gal pals!


[SpongeBob is reading a book in his library with Gary sitting next to him. A roller coaster crashes through the wall and hits a statue's head, causing it to hit the bookcase and the books collapse]
SpongeBob: Ah! Guests! Could I offer you some lemonade?
Frankie Billy: Man! That has to be the worst amusement park I have ever been to! I mean, we're lucky to escape with our lives!
Harold: I agree! The world will be a much better place when Glove World is gone for good! [Everyone except SpongeBob claps]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, did you just mention Glove World?
Frankie Billy: Yeah. Glove World. They're gonna close it. Tomorrow! Forever!
SpongeBob: Close Glove World?! Has the world gone mad?!
Frankie Billy: Well, that depends on your definition.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, I gotta go. [SpongeBob leaves in the library]
Frankie Billy: Wh-wh-wh what about our lemonade? [Cut to Patrick's rock, SpongeBob runs and stops to knock on the rock]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick is in the shower inside the rock]
Patrick: I can't come out now, SpongeBob. I'm taking a shower.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, it's Glove World! They're gonna... [Patrick is out of the shower and running]
Patrick: Glove World? [SpongeBob starts running]
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait! [Cutscene to Glove World Entrance. SpongeBob and Patrick made it to Glove World]
SpongeBob: There it is, Patrick. Glove World.
Patrick: Look at that guy, he must be the owner.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh, come on. Excuse us, sir, we heard a horrible rumor that you're gonna close Glove World forever.
Patrick: Close Glove World?! Has the world gone mad?! [Patrick is not wearing shorts and the owner is horrified.]
Glove World Owner: Here, son, take this. You don't wanna catch cold. [Patrick is putting on his Glove World hat as pants]
Patrick: Uh, it feels good.
SpongeBob: Ooh, that looks glovely on you, Patrick.
Patrick: Fits like a glove.
SpongeBob: Glove size fits all.
Patrick: A penny saved is a penny gloved!
SpongeBob: You can leave a glove to gloves, but you can't make it glove.
Patrick: She gloves me, she gloves me not.
SpongeBob: All's fair in glove and war.
Patrick: Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove.
Glove World Owner: Well, enjoy the hat. Now if you folks will excuse me, I have a rickety old theme park to close down.
SpongeBob: Then the rumors are true, you are gonna close Glove World!
Glove World Owner: Yep. [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nooooo!
Glove World Owner: I understand your concern, but really... [SpongeBob and Patrick screams again]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Nooooo! [Zooms out through Glove World]
SpongeBob: Oh, please, Mr. Soon To Be Ex-owner of Glove World. Could you see in your heart, to let us ride all our favorite rides? Just one last time.
Patrick: For all time's ride sake.
Glove World Owner: Well, seeing as it's our last day of operation anyway, and as long as the two of you pay the full admission price, sure, go right ahead!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are kissing to his feet.. Cut to Tilt-A-Hurl]
SpongeBob: Well, there she is, Patrick. It's time to say goodbye to the Tilt-A-Hurl. [SpongeBob and Patrick are getting in the seats]
Patrick: Goodbye, Tilt-A-Hurl. [The metal seat bar hits SpongeBob and Patrick. The Tilt-A-Hurl starts to spin]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Ow! [Hurls Again] Ow! [Hurls Again] Ow! [Hurls Again] Ow! [Hurls one more time] Ow! [The Tilt-A-Hurl stops]
Patrick: We'll miss you. [SpongeBob and Patrick get out of seats. Next, they are at the Glove Drop]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Glove Drop.
Patrick: So many fun memories on this ride.
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick, but we have to be brave. [Everyone is on the Glove Drop. The hand pushes the Glove Drop. It's falling down. Everybody is screaming, except SpongeBob and Patrick are crying. It crashes to the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick are up... sniffles] Where to next, Patrick?
Patrick: I think you know where, pal. [After that, they are at the Glove Boat]
SpongeBob: The Glove Boat. My most favorite ride in the entire glove kingdom. And it's the last time I'm ever gonna ride it.
Patrick: Come on, buddy. Let's take our seats. [Everyone is on the Glove Boat]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [weakly] Wee. [The Glove Boat swings back and forth, until it's upside down. Everyone falls out. Cut through the Glove World]
SpongeBob: I just don't get it, I mean, why? Why must Glove World close? [The roller coaster falls on the ground]
Patrick: Beats me. Let's go ride the Ferris Wheel. [Cut to the Ferris Wheel. SpongeBob sighs. The Ferris Wheel is rolling]
SpongeBob: Ew, did you hear that?
Patrick: Excuse me.
SpongeBob: No, not that it was... oh no, Patrick, look!
Patrick: Oh no! What am I looking at?
SpongeBob: The Ferris Wheel. It ripped free of it moorings! [The Ferris Wheel is still rolling]
Patrick: Then you mean...
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Patrick: It somehow ripped free of it moorings! [Everyone screams as the Ferris Wheel rolls throughout Glove World] SpongeBob, what are you doing? We must remain seated at all times!
SpongeBob: We have to jump before this thing crashes! Come on! [SpongeBob jumps off the Ferris Wheel]
Patrick: Bu-bu-bu-bu? But you know I'm allergic to jumping! You know that! [SpongeBob lands face-first on the ground and then he runs]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's now or never! You can do this!
Patrick: I uh, oh, if you say so. [Patrick tries to jump. Patrick was out of the ferris wheel]
SpongeBob: Nice job, Patrick.
Patrick: Thanks!
SpongeBob: Look! [The Ferris Wheel crashes into Glove Lake] Whoa, right in the middle of Glove Lake.
Patrick: That's really gonna spoil the view for the residents of Glove Castle.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think the time has come for us to accept reality.
Patrick: We've gone this far, why start now?
SpongeBob: All I'm saying is maybe there's a reason Glove World is closing. I mean just look around you. Open your eyes.
Patrick: Okay. [Patrick literally does so. At the Hall of Mirrors, Tom and his son are laughing at the mirror, but the mirrors shatter. Next at the mud slide, the log falls into the mud. Thaddeus and Evelyn get leeches on their body. At the glove karts, Harold honks the wheel]
Harold (red fish): Move it, slowpoke!
Fred: Hey, who you calling slowpoke, you sardine! [Everyone is stuck in the glove karts. Patrick closed his eyes]
SpongeBob: See what I mean, Patrick? Glove World is on its last legs.
Patrick: Yeah, or on its last finger.
SpongeBob: I just wish there was something we can do. [Patrick smiles]
Patrick: I know what we can do. Let's take a trip to Glove World to cheer ourselves up.
SpongeBob: Wait a second. [gasps] That's it!
Patrick: It is?
SpongeBob: Of course, we just have to fix Glove World.
Patrick: We do?
SpongeBob: Then everybody will love it again, and then will have no choice but to keep Glove World open. Are you with me?
Patrick: I think so. Yeah, I'm here. [Cut to the hall of mirrors, and SpongeBob is in the mirror]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is it. Do you remember what to say?
Patrick: SpongeBob, I'm not a stupid. Come one, come all, to the new, the improved...
SpongeBob: [whispers] Hall of mirrors.
Patrick: Hall of Mirrors!
Nat: Wow, new and improved? [SpongeBob turns into Nat] Wow, that's fantastic!
SpongeBob: It's working.
Ugly Fish: Oh, I'll try it. [SpongeBob turns into Ugly Fish] Hey! What kind of mirror is this!? [Ugly Fish hits SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow!
Ugly Fish: I'm glad they're closing this place down! [Cut the Bubble Poppin' Boy and Monroe]
Bubble Poppin' Boy: Hey there, kid. [Monroe kicks his leg] Ow! You little brat! I have had it! Three and a half weeks of working here and this is how I'm treated!? You're gonna have to pay for my shin-replacement surgery!
Glove World Owner: I'm sorry you feel that way, but if we were to accommodate every employee- [Bubble Poppin' Boy takes off the glove mascot and throws it at the owner]
Bubble Poppin' Boy: Accommodate this, boss man! [walks away]
Glove World Owner: Great! Now where am I gonna find another mascot?
Patrick: Mr. Owner, Mr. Owner! Can I wear the Glovey Glove costume? Please, please? I've always wanted to try it on. And also, this hat you lent me earlier is turning to get little worn out. See? [Close up to Patrick's butt]
Glove World Owner: Well, sure, why not? I mean, what could go wrong?
Patrick: Thanks! [Patrick laughs. Cut to ice cream stand]
Ice cream employee: Here you go, little boy.
Monroe: Thanks! [Patrick appears]
Patrick: Oh, oh! Glove ice cream! [Monroe cries] Thanks! [In the Glove Karts, Patrick cuts in line]
Sandals: The park mascot, cutting in line? [Monroe appears being angry]
Monroe: And he stole my ice cream! [Patrick has Monroe's ice cream on his mouth, and spits all over]
Patrick: I thought he gave it to me. [SpongeBob looks the glove swing is stopping]
SpongeBob: Boy, the swing ride is really slowing down. That's something I can fix. [The ride operator is asleep. And SpongeBob appears] Excuse me. [SpongeBob pushes the ride operator off his seat and puts on his glove hat. He pulls the lever to the fastest setting. The glove swing is fastest. The riders scream. Billy's hat flies away. Lloyd's shirt flies away. Mabel's hair flies away. Various articles of clothing fly away] Much better. [The roller coaster flew off the track. Everyone screams as they fly away. SpongeBob runs through the glove pole] Ooh. [SpongeBob is pushing the glove pole.] There. [The gray fish lands safely]
Gray Fish: Huh? Hey, I landed safely! [All of them land safely]
All: Hey, we landed safely! [The glove pole then snaps and all of them fall on the ground. SpongeBob steps back. Patrick is chasing with a mallet. Everyone screams]
Fish: He's insane! Run for your lives! [Everyone is exiting Glove World]
Patrick: Come back here!
SpongeBob: Patrick, stop! What are you doing?
Patrick: I'm just trying to test their strength with this giant hammer.
SpongeBob: Listen, Patrick, do you hear that?
Patrick: Yeah, it's the sound of total silence. [The tumbleweed appears and crosses through the empty Glove World] Plus tumbleweeds.
SpongeBob: Everybody's gone home, Patrick. We couldn't fix Glove World, and now it's over. And they're gonna close it, and there's nothing we can do.
Patrick: Well, there is one thing we can do. [At night, SpongeBob and Patrick are chained up at the Glove World entrance. The Glove World owner comes]
Glove World Owner: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: We're doing what any concerned, responsible person does when they're left no other choice.
Patrick: Yeah, brother! We're chaining ourselves to a gate.
Glove World! Owner: Well, I hope you don't plan on staying chained for long. Or you'll miss the big grand opening tonight.
SpongeBob and Patrick: The grand what?
Glove World! Owner: The grand opening. The only reason we're closing down Glove World, it's because Glove Universe is opening tonight. See for yourself. [The Glove Universe is grand opening with fireworks.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Glove Universe?!
Glove World Owner: Isn't she something? [sighs] Well, you two have a good night.
SpongeBob: Glove Universe grand opening! Are you ready, Patrick?!
Patrick: [Excited] You bet!
SpongeBob: Okay, let's get out of the chains. Give me the key.
Patrick: [Cluelessly] What key?
SpongeBob: The key that I gave you. The key that unlocks these chains.
Patrick: [Now remembering] Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you told me to keep that in a safe place, remember?
SpongeBob: [Curious and worried] So where you keeping it?
Patrick: [Stupidly] At the bottom of Glove Lake. Where no one will ever find it! [SpongeBob exasperated with Patrick's stupidity has a blank face, as it zooms out the Glove World Entrance] SpongeBob?


[Episode starts at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is sleeping, and his alarm clock wakes him up, he struggles to turn it off, yawns, then gets out of bed, puts his pants on, then walks into the kitchen to get food for Gary, he accidentally trips because of the heavy bag of food, and there's a big pile of food on top of Gary's bowl.]
SpongeBob: Gary, come and get it! [Gary doesn't come to get the food. Outside SpongeBob's pineapple, the wind is blowing and Bikini Bottom looks completely empty] Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? [SpongeBob looks in the living room, at the top of the staircase, out of a door at the bottom of the staircase, under his bed, and in the toilet, SpongeBob then walks back into the kitchen] Gary must have gotten an early start. [walks away. cuts to outside where SpongeBob is walking up to Squidward's house with a megaphone] Rise and shine, Squidward! You don't wanna be late again. [silence] Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab. [now talking to himself] I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks. [scene cuts to Patrick's house. SpongeBob knocks on it] Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again. [silence again] Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head. [cuts to scene of SpongeBob walking on the street whistling, where nobody else is, SpongeBob hops over a boat that's in the middle of the road, then walks in the Krusty Krab, and stares out the order window, the sun is setting, SpongeBob looks at his watch] Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs' office door opens, revealing that Mr. Krabs is not there. Scene then cuts back to SpongeBob's house] Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy? [walks into the kitchen, realizing that the big pile of food is still there] Gary? [gasps] He hasn't touched his food! [runs over to Squidward's house screaming, and then knocks on the door] Squidward! Open up! [door opens by itself] Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing! [no answer] Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward? [walks upstairs] You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet. [puts the clarinet in his mouth a few times] It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too! [runs over to Patrick's house] Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing! [lifts up rock, revealing that there's nobody there] Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?! [cuts to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! [gasp] He's gone, too! [cuts to Sandy's house] Sandy! She's gone. [cuts to SpongeBob walking out of five buildings, saying "Gone" each time he exits one, he then runs forward on the street, hyperventilating] Where did everybody go?! [we look around Bikini Bottom, then we see the whole city, where SpongeBob is doing the echo effect on a cliff] Go! Go! Go! Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them. [cuts to next day, where SpongeBob is blowing a bubble of himself, then plays a record of him laughing, he then runs into Squidward's house, takes the form of Squidward and imitating him] SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius. [plays on Squidward's clarinet, cuts to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise? ""[SpongeBob then sits in Mr. Krabs' chair and takes the form of Mr. Krabs] No! Now get to work! [as SpongeBob] Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! [as Old Man Jenkins] Excuse me, sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please? [as Squidward] Right away, sir! I mean... whatever. Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why. [giggles, then moves a box that looks like him] Coming up, Squidward! [cuts to SpongeBob at Patrick's house where he looks like him and is sleeping in Patrick's form, then cuts to Sandy's house] Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea? [as Sandy] Why sure! Whoops, just a sec. [grows a tail] Why sure now, SpongeBob. [cuts to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, SpongeBob as Mrs. Puff] Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat? [as SpongeBob] Ahem, floor it? [as Mrs. Puff] That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob! [as SpongeBob] Why thank you, Mrs.... [begins to sob] Pu... Pu... Puff! [starts to cry] This is pointless! I'm not Mrs. Puff! I can't replace everyone! I'll never be happy again! [notices a stack of blank driver's licenses on the desk] Ooh, my driver's license! [cuts to SpongeBob, taking a picture of him to put in the license] That's the baby. [he then walks up to a boat] Hi, fella, it's me. [boat drives away, SpongeBob then pulls it back up] It's okay, I'm licensed. [SpongeBob gets in the boat and starts it up] Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la- [SpongeBob starts driving it around Bikini Bottom causing destruction] -la-la-la... [he falls asleep, and drives into Patrick's house, causing it to skid up, missing Squidward's house, and then crashes into the second story of SpongeBob's house] Good night, Boaty. [is then having nightmares, and is talking in his sleep] No! No! [wakes up and screams] No! [pants] Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-! [screams, cause he notices that Boaty is right next to him in bed] So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty. [scene cuts to him and Boaty taking a shower, then eating cereal, then crashing out of the pineapple riding it, then jellyfishing, then at the Goo Lagoon, then on the seesaw, then driving into the Krusty Krab] This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? Great! [SpongeBob puts a box of Krabby Patties under Boaty's tire, then moving it to get the patties on the grill] Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one. [throws a Krabby Patty under his hood, it then splatters everywhere] What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work. [scene cuts to SpongeBob driving Boaty into the pineapple] Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane! [Boaty rumbles] What? A puppet of my old best friend? [Boaty rumbles again] Made entirely out of Krabby Patty Meat? [laughs] Oh, Boaty, you are a card. [SpongeBob walks into a closet, where he is talking to the puppet Boaty was talking about earlier] Sorry I'm late, Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke. [SpongeBob sticks his hand in there and starts talking for him]
Krabby Patty Patrick: You're awfully chummy with that guy for someone who has it out for you.
SpongeBob: Who, Boaty? [giggles] Oh no. He's... Really?
Krabby Patty Patrick: I can't talk now. He's watching us.
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick! Don't go! [notices Boaty is staring at him] Huh? Nothing! Boaty! I... I'm just going to bed.
Narrator: Three days later...
SpongeBob: [writing in his diary] Dear diary, not sure if I can trust any vehicle. Run for it as soon as the coast is clear. [SpongeBob looks out of the plant he's hiding in, seeing there's no one there, walks into a closet, where Boaty comes in, SpongeBob screams and bursts through the wall of his house] [runs into another boat and screams] [runs into a boat rental and screams] [runs inside The Reef theater, cut to inside one of the theater rooms, SpongeBob looks around to make sure there is no Boaty, he pulls up some popcorn and turns to the screen, a movie about vehicles is being shown and screams] [SpongeBob runs out of the theater, he grabs an ax and looks for Boaty, he sees a bus coming toward him, SpongeBob strikes at it with his axe. The bus stops, and everyone in Bikini Bottom steps out] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Sheesh. Calm down, boy.
SpongeBob: You're all still alive? Well, where did you go?
Mr. Krabs: It was National No SpongeBob Day.
SpongeBob: National No SpongeBob Day?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. A whole day dedicated to getting away from you.
SpongeBob: A day? But you guys have been gone for weeks.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... yeah well... we kinda milked it a little.
[Patrick comes out of the bus, he has a t-shirt with SpongeBob crossed out on it, SpongeBob sees this]
SpongeBob: You too, Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah. Everyone needs at least one day away from... [imitates SpongeBob's laugh]
SpongeBob: [sadly] I'm... glad you had fun. [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: Aww, cheer up, boy. It's a whole day inspired by you.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: Of course. [cut to a scene of everyone in Bikini Bottom except SpongeBob around a SpongeBob made of wood] First, we build a giant wooden effigy of you, then we burn it to the ground. [the citizens burn it] Whoo-hoo! Burn, baby! [cut to everyone dancing on the ashes of the effigy] And dance on the ashes like there was no tomorrow.
[cut back to the present time]
SpongeBob: Wow. A whole day dedicated to me. [blushes]
Patrick: Big deal. Wait 'til you see "No Patrick Day". Come on, everyone. Let's go! [everyone gets on the bus, SpongeBob knocks Patrick off when he tries to get on, Patrick immediately forgets what happened] Where'd everybody go? Hello? Hello? [looks around and the episode ends]


[It was a normal day at the Krusty Krab like any other. All of a sudden, Plankton, disguised as a peppershaker, steals a Krabby Patty from a customer.]
Plankton: Ha! [runs out of the Krusty Krab. However, Mr. Krabs picks him up from behind]
Mr. Krabs: Hold it right there, Plankton.
Plankton: Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: I'll take that. [Gets the Krabby Patty from him]
Plankton: How'd you know it was me?
Mr. Krabs: Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it.
Plankton: Hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious.
Mr. Krabs: You think? SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs onto the scene]
SpongeBob: Wooo-ooo! [Krabs puts Plankton in his mouth]
Announcer: [off-screen] 3, 2, 1…, launch! [SpongeBob launches Plankton out of his hat and through the Chum Bucket roof]
Plankton: AAHH!
[Cut to the park. Plankton is on a bench]
Plankton: Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too powerful. If only there were a way to render him helpless!
Sadie: [with her baby] Oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless.
Plankton: Hey, I resent that! Huh?
Sadie: [she takes the bottle from her baby] Why, you're so tiny and helpless, I could take your formula whenever I wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it. [the baby starts crying, Sadie puts the bottle back into her baby's mouth and moves on]
Plankton: Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless… baby.
[Cut to Mr. Krabs walking up to his restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: [A penny catches his eye] Ooh, a penny. [He sees a trail of pennies] A trail of pennies! [They lead him into a phone booth outside. We see some green gas appear around Krabs.]
Plankton: I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant! [He opens the phone booth, and grabs the key.] The key to the Krusty Krab. This is easier than I hoped. [Looks at baby Krabs] He's a little bigger than I imagined. [baby Krabs takes the key and swings it up and down, then puts Plankton into his mouth and starts biting him] Whoa! No, no! Ow, ow, ow! Oof! Whoa! [baby Krabs then sucks on Plankton, and releases him. He runs for the front doors of the Krusty Krab, with Krabs following behind him, but he can't reach.]
SpongeBob: Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here all alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up! [baby Krabs giggles] Oh, aren't you just too cute. [tickles baby Krabs] Coochie coochie coo! [they both laugh]
Plankton: Hello! If you're done making a total fool out of yourself, I could use some help with this lock.
SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing, Plankton. [places baby Krabs on top of him] Here you go, little guy. [places the key inside the door]
Plankton: Yes, my plan is working perfectly! Now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! [laughs, stops then notices SpongeBob staring at him] Hello.
SpongeBob: [looking at Plankton after hearing what he just said] Police! Police!
Plankton: [getting arrested] Fools, you'll never hold me! Your primitive shackles are no match for my genius. [the cuffs are too wide, and he easily escapes, dropping to the ground before running away, with the police on pursuit] That was easy. I'm free! Free!
[Squidward walks up to the Krusty Krab, looking glum as always]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby! [SpongeBob shows Squidward baby Krabs] It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned him into an infant so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula! [baby Krabs burps in Squidward's face] What do we do, Squidward?
Squidward: I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break. A very long coffee break. [walks away]
Plankton: [back at the Chum Bucket, talking to Karen] …and then that blasted sponge called the cops! That's just not cricket. [pouts] Now I'll never be a tyrannical overlord.
Karen: Do I have to tell you how to do everything? Next time, spray SpongeBob, too.
Plankton: Not sure I follow you.
Karen: Listen carefully. Spray...
Plankton: Yes.
Karen: ...Sponge....
Plankton: Uh-huh.
Karen: ....Bob.....
Plankton: Right.
Karen: ....Too!
Plankton: Now you're just talking gibberish. What I really need is to spray Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.
Karen: That's just what I…
Plankton: I don't wanna hear anymore of your loony schemes, Karen. I've got work to do!
[Back at the Krusty Krab, baby Krabs starts to cry.]
SpongeBob: Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty? [gives him some milk and he stops crying] That's it, drink up! [baby Krabs spits out the bottle and he continues to cry] Okay, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice soft Krabby Patty? [baby Krabs slaps it away and continues to cry] Yikes. Not even a Krabby Patty helps. [reaches into his pocket]How about a stack of 20s? [shows a stack of $20 bills; Krabs takes it and chews on it]
Plankton: Hands in the air!
SpongeBob: Plankton!
Plankton: [pops up at the scene, with a gas tank behind his back] That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time. [starts to spray. Mr. Krabs turns back into an adult, wearing a diaper, and SpongeBob turns into a baby] What? SpongeBob's a baby, but Krabs is back to normal? [sprays again. Mr. Krabs returns to his baby form as SpongeBob returns to normal, but is still wearing a rectangular diaper and is barefoot] It seems the second dose acts as an antidote! [sprays only SpongeBob, and he is turned back into a baby again] One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult! [sprays both of them once, and they come back to normal. They're still wearing their diapers] Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult? [tries to spray them, but nothing comes out] Barnacles, I've run out of gas!
Mr. Krabs: Ahem!
Plankton: Krabs! Nice diaper. [Mr. Krabs is about to throw him] Hold on, hold on! I think I... [throws him like a slingshot pellet; cut to Plankton flying in the air] Yes, I've got it!
Mr. Krabs: [checking the mailbox] Better be something other than bills this time. [Plankton comes out] Plankton!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo!
Mr. Krabs: [running back in the Krusty Krab] I can't tolerate your stinky gas!
Dennis: [farts]
Miss Shell: That makes two of us.
Dennis: I don't do it on purpose!
Mr. Krabs: You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Ooh…a nother penny! Come to papa! Now, what were we doing?
Plankton: This! [sprays him] What's the matter, baby? Are you gonna cry? [Mr. Krabs has turned into a senior citizen] What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas! It's senior citizen spray!
Mr. Krabs: Eh? What was that, sonny?
Plankton: Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless. [SpongeBob comes out of nowhere]
SpongeBob: Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!
Plankton: I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again! [sprays the gas on SpongeBob, turning him into a senior citizen]
SpongeBob: I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel. [laughs]
Plankton: This baby gas is worthless! [throws the spray fan away] At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: What was that, sonny?
Plankton: It'll take more time to explain than you have left. [walks away; runs back out with a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!
SpongeBob: Catch who?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Gesundheit.
Plankton: Victory is mine! [the bottom of the walkers cause Plankton to jump]
SpongeBob: Come back here, you little whippersnapper!
Mr. Krabs: You kids get off my lawn! I'll catch up with you, boy!
SpongeBob: I'm catching up with my knitting.
Mr. Krabs: [hatches an idea] That's it! Knit, little nitwit!
Plankton: That was almost too easy. [Plankton is caught in a net] What? No! I demand you geezers release me!
Mr. Krabs: Right after the party. The piñata party. [A group of senior citizens show up]
Plankton: What?
Senior Citizens: [beating Plankton with their canes and walkers] That's for calling us old.
Plankton: Hey, quit it!
Senior Citizens: I want candy!
Plankton: No!
[Cut to the Chum Bucket, with Plankton in his lab, writing something on a chalk board.]
Plankton: One squirt equals baby, carry over the two plus the square root of SpongeBob. Of course! The final ingredient that I've been lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just the place to get it.
[Cut to Barg'n Mart]
Plankton: Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?
Shubie: You mean the Kelp-O?
Plankton: No, that thing! The ugly drippy smelly thing.
Shubie: Are you talking about my baby? creep! [Chases Plankton with her cart. She ends up squashing him by running him over.]
Plankton: Ow, ow, ow! [moans] Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey, buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies? [Shubie squishes Plankton again with her cart.] Ow, ow, ow, ow! [Cut to the Chum Bucket] That powdered baby did the trick! Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!
Karen: Just like all your other plans that "couldn't possibly fail"?
Plankton: What is it now, Karen?
Karen: I'm saying you should test your gas before you run over there all willy nilly!
Plankton: That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig! [Grabs the pack and points it at Karen]
Karen: [gasps] Plankton, don't you dare! [sprays her and a calculator falls to the ground]
Plankton: Karen! Speak to me! [the calculator types in "hello" as 07734 upside down] It worked!
[Cut to the Krusty Krab, where the old Mr. Krabs is drinking a soda]
Plankton: Everyone say your ABCs! [sprays two people, who start crying] Now when you turn into babies, [sprays two more people] you stay babies! Hey, Krabs, catch! [throws a gas bomb which turns Mr. Krabs into a baby, who starts crying. SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: What's wrong, little feller? [A gas bomb was thrown at him and explodes, turning him into a baby. They both cry]
[Cut to an aerial view of the Krusty Krab where everyone is turning into babies. Patrick is seen turning into a baby. Squidward opens the bathroom door and sees what's going on, then walks away. A gas bomb explodes in the bathroom turning Squidward into a crying baby. Then all the babies cry super duper loud and the Krusty Krab explodes.]
Plankton: That was loud.
 [The episode ends abruptly with a black screen with white text saying, 'THE END'.]


[Everyone is sleeping until SpongeBob's foghorn alarm wakes them up]
Squidward: SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?!
SpongeBob: I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.
Squidward: Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.
SpongeBob: My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for.
Squidward: You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.
SpongeBob: What's that, Squidward?
Squidward: It's Sunday! [angrily kicks SpongeBob out of his house] A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!
SpongeBob: Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgot his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him. [breaks the string that holds the paper together] Man this is heavy. [bumps into Patrick] Oh, pardon me.
Patrick: Hey, watch where you're going. [screams] Newspaper monster!
SpongeBob: [throws paper in the air, screaming] AHH!!! Monster! [both scream and run around]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
Squidward: Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday. [hums] My Sunday relaxation kit. [reaches into box] Let's see…pillow. [puts pillow on end of couch] Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance. [sprays fragrance on flower. The flower dies] Ah, and the final touch. [dials on phone] Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man. [hangs up phone] This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot. [grabs a box] Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder, take me on a chocolate vacation. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick raise up from behind the couch making noises. Squidward spits out his chocolate]
Patrick: Ooooooooohhhhhh!
SpongeBob: Ooooooohhhhh!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: By the all seeing eye, ye are worthy. We are not.
Squidward: What are you two idiots doing?
Patrick: Secret ritual.
SpongeBob: To inaugurate you as president.
Squidward: Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.
Patrick: No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.
Squidward: Better?
SpongeBob: You're the president of The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge!
Squidward: The WHAT?! Oh, is this some stupid club you two made up?!
Patrick: Hehehehe...maybe. [both laugh]
SpongeBob: It's a secret. [both laugh]
Squidward: Fine. As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer? [pushing SpongeBob &amp; Patrick out the door] Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays. [when he closes the door, SpongeBob &amp; Patrick appear from inside]
SpongeBob: What color should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?
Squidward: Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Wow. Polka dots.
Patrick: Our new president is a genius.
SpongeBob: Yeah. [both laugh]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: See ya later, Squidward.
SpongeBob: [now outside, a red paint can drops on the ground] Whenever you're ready, Patrick.
Patrick: [Patrick unscrews SpongeBob's hat which turns out to be a screw] Hold still, buddy. [pours the red paint inside SpongeBob's hole. When he is done, he throws the can away and ends up hitting an elderly citizen riding a bike. Patrick screws the hat back in]
SpongeBob: Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake.
Patrick: Okie dokie. [Patrick shakes SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay! I'm ready! [Patrick grabs SpongeBob's arm and uses it like a slot machine. Drops of red paint come shooting out SpongeBob's holes and onto trees] Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot.
Squidward: [clock on wall is ringing noon] Oh, no. It's already noon. I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [outside one of Squidward's windows singing] Good neighbors are we. La-la-la-la-la-la.
Squidward: What's going on out there?
SpongeBob: Hi, president Squidward. Almost done painting the- [Patrick pulls on SpongeBob's arm which makes the paint shoot out his holes and all over Squidward's face and in his eyes]
Squidward: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! MY EYES!! [runs around bumping into stuff. Runs outside and in front of a car]
Gale Rechid: Look out! [car slams on brakes and stops in front of Squidward]
Ralph: Oh, you poor man.
Gale: You must be very sick! Let us take you to the hospital.
Squidward: No really, I'm fine. Please, I…no, uhh… [car drives off]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: See ya later, neighbor!
Patrick: It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.
SpongeBob: Yeah, our president sure knows how to live. [later] I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick. [Patrick is snoring] Okay…Squidward? [Squidward's chair is empty] Squidward? Squidward, you home?
Patrick: Did you find him, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.
Patrick: Or maybe he's on a secret mission.
SpongeBob: I hope he's not in danger.
Patrick: Danger?!
SpongeBob: As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger.
Harold (red fish): Excuse me? Somebody ordered a relaxing pedicure and foot massage? The Sunday special?
SpongeBob: Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward.
Squidward: At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to. [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are laughing inside Squidward's house. Squidward opens his front door] What are you two doing in my house?
SpongeBob: We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.
Patrick: I say he checks out a-ok.
SpongeBob: Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips? [shows foot with long toenails]
Squidward: French tips, huh? [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick's chair out of the way] Alright, pal, make with the relaxing foot massage, pronto!
Harold (red fish): Uh-oh. Sorry. Your hour's up. [packed up and leave]
Squidward: [He shockedly twitches his eye. As SpongeBob happily continues wiggling his toes, he angrily makes way toward the front door] Alright, you two! OUT!!! [SpongeBob and Patrick, realizing that they are in trouble, slowly walk out] And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day! Or tomorrow! Or next week!
SpongeBob: Squidward, does that include…
Squidward: [angrily screams] YES, IT DOES! [furiously slams door]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?
Squidward: [angrily bursts head through the door, exploding] YES, I WAS! You call yourselves good neighbors? YOU'RE THE WORST NEIGHBORS EVER! [deep breath] You don't deserve to wear those fezzes! [furiously takes SpongeBob and Patrick's fezzes and angrily stomps them into the ground]
SpongeBob: Gee, Pat, maybe President Squidward's right.
Patrick: Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all.
Squidward: [furiously explodes once again] NO, YOU AREN'T!!! YOU'RE HORRIBLE NEIGHBORS!!! [he angrily hyperventilates] AND STOP CALLING ME PRESIDENT!!!
SpongeBob: C'mon, let's go. [SpongeBob and Patrick sadly walk away]
Squidward: There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper. [notices pile of paper on ground with a note on it]
SpongeBob: ['Here's Your Sunday Paper Squidward. Enjoy. Love, SpongeBob.'.]
[Squidward steams up furiously, kicks the paper into the air, then growls like a dog. Then he takes a paper off his head.]
Squidward: Good neighbors my right. [reads paper] Hello? "Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation" [Squidward does an evil laugh. Later, he has the security system built in and turned on]
Security System: System Activated.
Squidward: That oughta do it. Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now.
SpongeBob: [he with Patrick, with their fezzes back on, walk up to Squidward] President Squidward?
Squidward: [screams] What the…?!
SpongeBob: We hereby present you with this delicious cake.
Squidward: [reads writing on cake] "Sorry for bugging you so much"? What the…? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!
Security System: No threat detected.
Squidward: [angry, banging on security system] Grrr! You infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!
Security System: Threat detected. [The system shoots a laser at Squidward which makes SpongeBob &amp; Patrick's cake fly into the air and land on the system, causing it to go haywire.]
Squidward: What's going on?
Security System: Threat detected. Code red. Code red!
SpongeBob: [laughing as fireworks are shooting out all over Squidward's house] It's like a carnival ride!
Squidward: [running around] Run for your lives! [Squidward's house suddenly grows legs and arms and stands up. Then grabs Squidward from inside] What the-? What are you doing?! [Squidward's house kicks him into the air and walks off.] I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for. [laughs hysterically] I am gonna relax if it kills me.
[Meanwhile, Squidward's house is on a rampage.]
Army: Fire! [The tank fires a missile at the house, but the house catches the missile and flicks it away. Then the house grabs the tank and squishes it.]
Patrick: Wow. Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood.
SpongeBob: We gotta turn this thing off. [turns on a light switch] Nope, not it.
Patrick: [flushes the toilet] Nope.
SpongeBob: [turns on the fan] Nope.
Patrick: [pushes the toasted button down] That's not it, either.
Squidward: [still resting] This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot. [house stands right above Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hmmm, where to look. [notices an "off button" on the wall] Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious. [pushes button and house sits on top of Squidward and goes back to normal] We did it, Patrick! [Squidward busts through from beneath the floor] President Squidward?
Squidward: No-no, don't say anything. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so that I can get ready for work tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Mr. President-
Squidward: Shush.
SpongeBob: But we just wanted to…
Squidward: [yells in their faces angrily] Get out of my house! Huh?
[As soon as SpongeBob and Patrick flee from Squidward, a whole angry mob and two police boats appear outside Squidward's house.]
Scooter: There he is!
Jasper (green fish): Are you the owner of this house?
Squidward: Yes! Yes, I am!
Jasper (green fish): Then on behalf of the citizens of Bikini Bottom, [the angry fish hands him a warrant] I present you with this summons to pay for the destruction of our town. You'll be doing community service every Sunday for the rest of your life.
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too? [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick walk up with a summons in their hands] This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward!
[Squidward twitches with rage.]



[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick having a fun time in Jellyfish Fields. They attempt to catch some jellyfish but snagged themselves with the nets while there are jellyfish on their heads. Patrick removes his net and the jellyfish stings him, swelling his head. The same thing happens to SpongeBob. They both laugh at each other because of how funny they look. The scene changes to them skipping down the road. Then the scene changes to them brushing their teeth near a mirror at a mirror store, which puzzles several bystanders. Then the scene changes to them at the outlet store. They both slip into a large pair of pants. Then they wobble out of the store.]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh.
Patrick: No, no, just—
SpongeBob: Whoa. [grunts]
[The scene changes to the Barg'N-Mart where SpongeBob and Patrick are wobbling in the freezer aisle. As they wobble, they knock over a few things until they lose their balance and fall over.]
Patrick: It's harder to walk, but worth it.
[They stand back up.]
SpongeBob: Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day: buying ourselves the perfect ice cream.
[SpongeBob's opens the freezer door.]
Patrick: So many flavors.
[A huge stack of ice cream is shown with various flavors. At the top, a mountain climber appears and yodels. SpongeBob and Patrick jump into the freezer.]
Both: Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Hmm, what brand should we buy, Hogen Duep?
Patrick: No, that's too fancy.
[SpongeBob and Patrick search through the pile until they find one carton of ice cream with the flavor rocky road.]
Both: Rocky road!
Patrick: With real rocks!
SpongeBob: Rocky road, unlike our friendship, which is a smooth avenue and will never have any bumps.
[Moments later, Mr. Krabs comes by with a shopping cart and unintentionally shuts the freezer door on SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Mr. Krabs: Bump. [notices SpongeBob and Patrick trapped in the freezer, not knowing it was them] When did food get so ugly?
[Mr. Krabs opens the freezer door and takes out one of the frozen dinner boxes while SpongeBob and Patrick are stuck to the door.]
Mr. Krabs: [reading] "Lonely Krab Dinner for One: Now 30% lonelier." Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient.
[Mr. Krabs takes out a few frozen dinner boxes and puts them in his cart. SpongeBob and Patrick slide off the door. SpongeBob slides over to the shopping cart, takes one of the boxes, and looks at it.]
SpongeBob: Can you imagine if they had frozen Krabby Patties at the supermarket? Oh, that would be so convenient, everyone in the world could enjoy them.
[Mr. Krabs' nose ignites like a dynamite and his eyes pops into confetti, which resulted in giving him an idea.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, that's a million dollar idea that I just had that you just said before me.
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab being recorded for a commercial. Mr. Krabs is at the front doors where he is in between two tables. One table had a plate of Krabby Patties and the other had a box labeled "Frozen Krabby Patties." During the commercial, SpongeBob peeks through the window.]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, welcome to my commercial. Would you like the convenience of a Krabby Patty at home, without the hassle of going to the Krusty Krab? Well, now you can. [takes a patty] Have delicious Krabby Patties any time you want. [stuffs patty in the box] They're in your grocer's freezer section. Buy them. I want your money! Did you get that, Pearly-girl?
Pearl: Yes, Daddy, and stop babying me!
[Pearl turns off the camera. The video is shown to a local business executive named Don Grouper. The TV turns off and the picture of Don closes.]
Mr. Krabs: So, Mr. Grouper, what do you think?
Don Grouper: Call me Don.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, well, okay, Don. Will this make me rich?
[Don thinks for a few seconds. As some sort of Easter egg, his thinking face is the same as his picture.]
Don Grouper: Mr. Krabs, if you wanna sell zero Krabby Patties and wind up in the poor house, then I say go with your commercial.
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
Don Grouper: But if you really want to be rich, keep your mouth shut, and listen to us, sir. [tooth sparkle]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. Okay.
[Don pushes the button on the remote, opens the floor and reveals four more executives.]
Don Grouper: Let me introduce you to the team here at GGK. That's Barry Goby, Rob Koi, and Limia with her team from creative. Everyone, this is Mr. Krabs and a yellow box.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, actually, my name is Spon-
Don Grouper: Let's say we give a look-see at what we've cooked up for you.
[Don pushes the button on the remote, which shuts the blinds on the windows and turns on a hologram of a Krabby Patty.]
Don Grouper: The Krabby Patty, a mainstay of dining in Bikini Bottom for a very long time, [SpongeBob tries to touch the hologram, but Mr. Krabs stops him.] like an old friend, but not too old, because research shows us old is gross.
Limia: Yes, oh, it's absolutely...
Barry Goby: Oh, of course...
Rob Koi: Just gross.
Barry Goby: Yeah, no, it's disgusting.
Old executive: Well, I don't think old is gross.
[Don pushes the button on the remote and opens a trapdoor for the old executive to fall through. The old executive is replaced by a baby executive. The baby spits out its pacifier, takes out her phone and texts it.]
Baby executive: Goo-goo, social networking, ah, ah!
Don Grouper: Exactly. Now, here are some of the slogans we've been kicking around.
[Don pushes the button on the remote and shows Martin walking with a Krabby Patty.]
Don Grouper: "Krabby Patties: Like a friend, but edible." [shows another one with a delivery man] "Krabby Patties: The shut-in's favorite patty." [shows another with two Krabby Patties on a cliff] And finally, "Krabby Patties: Shove 'em in your mouth-hole!" [mouth-hole burps]
SpongeBob: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I have a slogan!
[The executives stare at SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, "Krabby Patties: Taste so nice that they... taste nice."
[Don is silent. The other executives nod their heads in disagreement. The baby executive blows a raspberry.]
Mr. Krabs: Let's just leave it to the professionals, boy-o.
Don Grouper: The thing is, Frozen Krabby Patties are a convenience for everyone, and we need a campaign that says exactly that. We need a regular guy to represent all consumers.
SpongeBob: Me!
Don Grouper: Someone everyone can relate to...
SpongeBob: Oh, me, me!
Don Grouper: With a face that says, "I love Krabby Patties."
[As Don thinks, SpongeBob winks his eyes. One eye has the letter I on it. The other has a heart on it. SpongeBob then reveals a Krabby Patty on his tongue.]
Don Grouper: We find that face, and we have our campaign.
Mr. Krabs: And I've got the perfect guy for the job.
[SpongeBob happily grins. Then a frozen Krabby Patty box is shown being put in the microwave by Patrick. Patrick is sitting on a recliner chair, opens the microwave, takes out the Krabby Patty from the box, and eats it.]
Patrick: Krabby Patties: They taste so nice, that they taste nice.
[The filmmaker claps the clapperboard and the scene is finished. Patrick gets of the chair.]
SpongeBob: Hey, that was my slogan.
[Don walks over to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs with Patrick.]
Don Grouper: Great stuff, huh? This guy is gonna be a star!
Patrick: I'm already a star.
Don Grouper: That's the attitude.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, now that I'm finished doing whatever it is I'm doing, you wanna go play?
SpongeBob: [gasps]
Limia: Sorry, yellow box, Patrick has to make a personal appearance at the mall.
SpongeBob: I—oh...
[SpongeBob sadly walks away.]
Mr. Krabs: Don, will this commercial really help me make money?
Don Grouper: You need to call your bank, Krabs, because they are gonna have to build an extra vault to hold all the extra money.
[Mr. Krabs faints into Don's arms.]
Mr. Krabs: [in Southern accent] Ooh, I do declare, Mr. Grouper, I believe I have a case of the vapors.
Don Grouper: I told you, call me Don. [tooth sparkle]
Mr. Krabs: Don.
Don Grouper: Of course, you could double, maybe even triple or quadruple that money, if you... No, forget it.
Mr. Krabs: What? Forget what? What? What?! What are you saying?
Don Grouper: Well, we ran some numbers and realized that you could make a lot more money if you... changed the formula.
Mr. Krabs: How much "a lot more"?
Don Grouper: A lot "a lot more."
Mr. Krabs: Well, then let's fill her up with filler!
[SpongeBob walks back in, having heard what Don just said.]
SpongeBob: [shocked] Mr. Krabs, are you changing the secret Krabby Patty formula?
Mr. Krabs: Heh, no, I-I can— well, it's just a little tweak, me boy.
SpongeBob: But what is "filler"?
Don Grouper: [walks over to SpongeBob and squishes his head to avoid more questions.] Whoa, hey, this little yellow box sure is full of questions. What do you say we go see where the money's made?
Mr. Krabs: Ho-ho, that sounds great!
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab with a large factory built behind it. Don is driving a cart while SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs ride in it.]
Don Grouper: Take a look around. It's your dream come true. Through the wonders of automation, this factory can make as many Krabby Patties in one minute as you used to make in a week. Take a whiff of the future, Krabs. Does it smell like money?
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] Oh, yeah.
[During the tour, one of the workers ended up on the conveyor belt and is burned and frozen in the process.]
SpongeBob: Hey, why does that barrel say "sand"?
[SpongeBob point to a filler where workers are suspiciously filling it with sand.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's imported. It's spelled "sand" but it's pronounced, "filler."
Don Grouper: Hey, let's check in on our taste test area.
[Don drives to cart towards the test lab in a fast motion. He stops and SpongeBob flies into the window of the lab. SpongeBob slides off the window. Mr. Krabs and Don looks into the window where a taste test of the frozen Krabby Patty is being performed.]
Fish Guy: Hmm. This tastes kind of bad.
Limia: [holds up a dinner box with Patrick on it.] Would you buy it, though?
Fish Guy: Well, yeah, for the convenience... and the face of that stupid guy [chuckles] Though I have noticed a bit of a side effect. Hmm-hmm.
[The fish guy points to his behind as it appears to have gotten bigger. Limia calls for security and the guards carry the fish guy out,]
Limia: [laugh] He loves it.
[Two executives drive up, one of which resembles the vacation salesman from That's No Lady.]
Executive: Great news, Krabs. Sales are going all the way up to the surface of the ocean. Here's your first check.
[The executive gives Mr. Krabs a check. His check revealed to be 100 million dollars. The date on the check says 1/28/16. This hints that this episode takes place in January 28, 2016.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
[Mr. Krabs opens the check further and reveals more zeroes at the end, meaning he has made a lot of money. He gasps and looks at the back and sees even more zeroes. His pupils scream. Mr. Krabs faints in Don's arms again.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm rich, boy-o, rich!
SpongeBob: Great, can we go back to the Krusty Krab now?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes, we can.
SpongeBob: Hooray, finally!
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab with a Patrick robot on the roof. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs enter the restaurant as workers are building inside. SpongeBob runs into the kitchen, takes out his spatula and prepares to make Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: Whatcha doing, boy?
SpongeBob: Making Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, you've made your last Krabby Patty.
[Nat comes in and brings a robotic SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: You mean my last one for the morning rush?
Mr. Krabs: No, ever.
[Nat moves SpongeBob away from his position with a forklift.]
SpongeBob: You mean my last one for today-ever?
Mr. Krabs: No, I mean forever and ever. You're fired.
SpongeBob: [confused] Fired?
[Nat takes the spatula.]
Mr. Krabs: But I'm ready to re-hire you.
SpongeBob: Oh, please, re-hire me Mr. Krabs. I'll do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Then follow me.
[Mr. Krabs leads SpongeBob out of the kitchen. The robotic SpongeBob looks at SpongeBob with red eyes as he leaves. He shows animatronic robots of Patrick, Squidward, and various customers in the restaurant. The Krusty Krab has somehow turned into a museum under Don Grouper's orders.]
Robot Patrick: This tastes nice.
[A robotic Plankton is at the safe and is hammered by a robot Mr. Krabs.]
Robot Plankton: Ow, curses, foiled again, ow.
SpongeBob: You turned the Krusty Krab into some kind of museum?
Mr. Krabs: That's right, me boy. It's all history now, but you, you have the most important job of all. [carries SpongeBob to the gift shop.] You give tours and sell tchotchkes in the gift shop.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but what if someone wants a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, we've got plenty of Krabby Patties right here in the freezer.
[Mr. Krabs takes out a frozen Krabby Patty, puts it in the microwave, and heats it up.]
Patrick Microwave: Ding.
[Mr. Krabs takes out the heated up Krabby Patty.]
Mr. Krabs: You see? Customers at the museum can cook the patties themselves, like this.
[Mr. Krabs eats the Krabby Patty. However, he does not appear to be enjoying it because of the taste.]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, it's so convenient, see? [chuckles]
[Squidward walks in.]
Squidward: And what about me?
[Mr. Krabs swallows the patty and puts it in his pocket.]
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired.
Squidward: Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?
Mr. Krabs: Heh! No, you're just fired.
Squidward: What? No, you don't fire me—I quit! I got my resignation letter all prepared. [reads resignation letter] "Dear Mr. Krabs—"
Mr. Krabs: Do you have a ticket, sir? Can't be in a museum without a ticket.
Squidward: What the—what?! [continues reading as he is being carried out by a delivery man] "I-I-I tender my resignation from this greasy establishment. Too long have I toiled under your iron claw. Now I am free—free to live my dreams of being a ballet dancer, ha-ha, and the first chair clarinet in the Bikini Bottom Orchestra, ha-ha, and I am going to finally publish my mystery/thriller novel: 'Dial D for Doily!"
[Mr. Krabs places a Krabby Patty shaped hat on SpongeBob's head and opens the front door to let customers in.]
SpongeBob: Ahem, [reads card] "hello, and welcome to the Krusty Krab Museum, the original home of the Krabby Patty, now available in the frozen food section of your local supermarket."
[The robotic Squidward behind SpongeBob explodes.]
SpongeBob: Oh, and don't forget to buy souvenirs at the gift shop.
Mr. Krabs: Atta boy, embrace the future!
[Mr. Krabs leaves. The robotic Squidward's head lands on the floor. As time passes by, customers with larger butts continue to by Frozen Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs goes to the bank and gives the bank loaner a check. The loaner gives Mr. Krabs a huge sack of money, which resulted in Mr. Krabs fainting. The loaner pushes the bag off of the counter. Patrick is at the Barg'N-Mart signing autographs to his fans. SpongeBob attempts to get Patrick's attention. But due to the popularity, he is being ignored as Patrick is busy signing autographs to his fans. Mr. Krabs is in his swimsuit and goes into a pool of money. He swims all around the pool. Then he pulls down a lever and money pours down on him. The scene then changes to a local hotel where it is built at the spot where Patrick's house used to be. SpongeBob goes into the hotel.]
Elevator operator: Going up?
[SpongeBob goes into the elevator.]
SpongeBob: I'm going to a party—a party to celebrate my friend's upcoming 400th commercial.
Elevator operator: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: I brought ice cream. Me and my best friend are gonna share the ice cream. Who knows? Maybe we'll even get a chance to share pants. [laughs] Again.
Elevator operator: [grossed out] You should get out. Now.
[SpongeBob leaves the elevator and goes into a room filled with rich people at Patrick's party.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.
Colonel Sandab: Uh, Patrick, did you order something through the mail? 'Cause a yellow box just arrived for you.
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, I'm sure glad you made it to my party.
Colonel Sandab: Uh, excuse me, yellow box, are you feeling a little overheated? Because I do—I say, I do believe that you are melting. [laughs]
[The snotty rich people laugh at SpongeBob as the ice cream melts.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, I guess I should get this in a freezer. Patrick, where's the kitchen?
Patrick: Oh, I don't know.
Limia: It's just past the solid gold gym. Take a right at the zoo.
SpongeBob: I'll come with you, SpongeBob.
Limia: He can find the kitchen by himself. The press needs some photos of you with your new mascot friends.
SpongeBob: [sadly] Aww.
Patrick: [sadly] Aww.
[SpongeBob sulks to the kitchen freezer and opens it. In it is a huge stack of HOGAN DUEP ice cream. A yodel is heard in the background. SpongeBob looks sadly at the freezer. He didn't bother to put the ice cream he brought to the party in the freezer, so he places it on the countertop. He sulks away as Patrick is getting photos from the press.]
Press: This way, Mr. Star! Hey, Patrick, over here! Over here, right here! Who are you wearing?
French Narrator: The next day...
[The scene changes to SpongeBob sulking at the front door of the Krusty Krab Museum. He sighs and puts on the Krabby Patty hat. He walks into the former restaurant and trips over Squidward's foot.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, oof!
Squidward: Ow.
SpongeBob: [his body is face-down but his face come out and sees Squidward] Squidward? What are you doing here? I thought you were off following your dreams.
Squidward: I was. They turned out to be nightmares. Apparently, you need more than 17 years behind a cash register to be qualified for dreams. [holds out paper that reveals that Squidward has been a cashier for exactly 17 years.] I never thought I would say this, but I'm begging you, SpongeBob, let me come back and work at the Krusty Krab Museum.
SpongeBob: I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off.
Robot Squidward: I love my job. Thanks for coming!
Squidward: Totally out of character.
[Squidward takes the Krusty Krab hat, pushes the robotic Squidward out of the register boat, and takes over.]
Squidward: [mechanical-esque] I hate everyone. [regular] Huh, much better.
French Narrator: Later...
[The scene changes to the filmmakers at the Krusty Krab Museum setting up for a commercial.]
Patrick: [reads script] "Tastes so nice that they—"
Squidward: They taste like lice!
Patrick: Oh, now I gotta start over! Ooh, someone fix that broken robot.
Squidward: Huh?
[Nat grabs Squidward and flips him over. Then he takes out a drill and proceeds to painfully drill Squidward in the behind.]
Squidward: What are you doing with this—ow!
Patrick: [reads script] "Tastes so nice that they taste nice."
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, rehearsing your big 400th commercial, huh?
Limia: Excuse me, yellow box, Mr. Star is not to be disturbed. He's very, very busy right now.
SpongeBob: Yeah, sure. I get it.
[SpongeBob sulks away.]
Patrick: But he's my friend.
Limia: You're a star. You have no friends.
[Limia walks away and Don comes to check on Patrick.]
Patrick: [sighs] What am I doing again?
Don Grouper: Stand over here and say your line. And...action.
[Don gives Patrick a Krabby Patty before he leaves for the filming to begin. Patrick is standing next to a table of Frozen Krabby Patties with the number 400 sign. Patrick eats the patty but doesn't appeared to be thrilled with it.]
Patrick: Tastes so nice, it... uh... [Patrick throws down the Krabby Patty and starts looking and acting depressed.] blah, blah, blahblahbli-blah...
[Patrick becomes depressed as the 400 sign lights up. Confetti is then released.]
Don Grouper: And..cut! Alright, you guys can fix that in post. Okay? that's a wrap. Let's pack it up.
[Limia walks up with a contract for Patrick to sign.]
Limia: Okay, and here. And here. Okay, and then sign here. And again here.
SpongeBob: Patrick, there's something weird about these Frozen Krabby Patties.
[SpongeBob notices a filmmaker eating one of the Frozen Krabby Patty. After he eats it, he goes to remove the headlight and his behind becomes larger.]
Filmmaker 2: Looks like you've been hitting the patties pretty hard there.
Filmmaker 1: Speak for yourself.
[The other filmmaker's behind is larger than the other.]
SpongeBob: Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out. [continues as filmmaker is carrying SpongeBob] I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrick—oof!
[The filmmaker places SpongeBob in a box that comically contains yellow boxes.]
Limia: Come on, Mr. Star. You've got an 11:00 eyeball waxing.
Patrick: [sighs] See you later, SpongeBob.
[Patrick sulks away.]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Aww.
[Patrick and Limia walk up to a limo where they are driven away, while a bicyclist follows them with a sign that says "Eat Frozen Krabby Patties." Meanwhile, Plankton sneaks by, hoping that he will finally get the secret formula.]
Plankton: Finally, now is my chance to strike.
[Plankton runs into the museum.]
SpongeBob: Welcome to the original Krusty—
[Plankton runs up to the safe where the robotic Plankton and Mr. Krabs are being operated.]
Robot Plankton: Curses, foiled again. Curses, foiled again.
Plankton: Pfft, never happened.
[Plankton jumps into the safe, grabs the formula, and kicks the robotic Plankton.]
Plankton: Now to make my escape.
[Plankton make his escape as he laughs. Surprisingly, robotic Mr. Krabs's hammer does not smash Plankton. However, he stops to notice that SpongeBob is not in the mood for chasing him.]
Plankton: Aren't you gonna try and stop me?
SpongeBob: That'll be $1.99, please.
Plankton: What do you mean, $1.99? You're not gonna step on me? I've got the secret formula, you know.
SpongeBob: Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop.
[SpongeBob takes one of the bottles and pulls out a blank paper.]
SpongeBob: See? They're all just fakes. [rips up the paper] Everything here is a fake!
Plankton: Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to? [smashes bottle] All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go.
Patrick Microwave: Ding.
[SpongeBob takes the patty out of the microwave and gives it to Plankton.]
Plankton: [laughs] Yes, you fools!
[Plankton runs off.]
Squidward: Shouldn't we chase after him? He didn't pay.
SpongeBob: Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?
[SpongeBob takes a bite of the Frozen Krabby Patty and doesn't like the taste of it. Then suddenly, without warning, he throws up sand and it forms into a sandcastle. SpongeBob then coughs up a toy shovel.]
SpongeBob: Sand?! It tastes like sand! Not good sand, either.
Squidward: Of course it does. What do you think Krabs uses as filler?
SpongeBob: Krabby Patties aren't made with sand! They're made with love.
[SpongeBob runs to the kitchen, retrieves his spatula, and kicks away the robot SpongeBob. He opens his body and takes out the real Krabby Patty formula. He opens the bottle, takes out the formula and reads it. His eyes glimmer with happiness.]
SpongeBob: Mm! I am going to show the world what a fresh, [puts Krusty Krab hat on] not frozen Krabby Patty tastes like, and the first one is for my best friend, Patrick.
[SpongeBob cooks the patty on the grill. As he cooks, depressed citizens with large butts smell the scent of the Krabby Patty being handmade by SpongeBob. Meanwhile, Patrick is getting interviews from the press with Don and Limia.]
Press: Over here. Right here, Patrick. Right here, right here. One, more, Patrick.
Agent: Patrick, baby, sweetheart, have you thought about that feature film I pitched youse?
[Patrick sadly looks at the picture of himself with SpongeBob until a camera man flashes in Patrick's eyes. Patrick is finally fed up with his popularity.]
Patrick: That's it! I can't take it anymore! Everybody out!
[Don, Limia, and the press leaves Patrick's hotel.]
Patrick: I wish things could go back to the way they were. Mm... [rubs his picture with his hand] I just wanna be able to share one pair of pants with my best friend without it being in the papers.
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob has finished his handmade Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Freshly grilled Krabby Patty, you and I are going to save the world. And save a friendship.
[Patrick sulks at the balcony when he sees SpongeBob running up to him.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob! [Patrick leaves the hotel and runs to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [through a bullhorn] Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!
Patrick: [Still running and not hearing,]SpongeBob, what?
SpongeBob: [through a cell phone] Patrick, the Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand!
Patrick: [through a telephone] I thought they tasted familiar!
[SpongeBob and Patrick soon crash into each other.]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob pulls himself off of Patrick and lands with a big hole in his face. He regenerates his face.]
SpongeBob: Missed you.
Patrick: I missed you too.
SpongeBob: [takes out the Krabby Patty he made himself] I got something for you, from one friend to another.
Patrick: No, no, I don't wanna eat another one of those things!
[SpongeBob stuffs his handmade Krabby Patty into Patrick's mouth. As he eats it, he begins to feel a sense of happiness. He flies around the air with joy.]
Patrick: Mm! Now that's a real Krabby Patty! Oh, as delicious as our real friendship.
SpongeBob: Now that we've saved our friendship, we have to save the reputation of the Krabby Patty.
Patrick: But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand? [kicks sand in SpongeBob's face]
[SpongeBob wipes the sand off his face.]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach.
[The scene changes to the shareholder meeting. Don and Mr. Krabs are on stage speaking to the audience.]
Don Grouper: Thank you, everyone, for coming to this gala event celebrating the meteoric success of Frozen Krabby Patties. In honor of this momentous occasion, we are going to premiere our 400th commercial.
Mr. Krabs: And here to say a few words is the face of the Frozen Krabby Patty, our own Patrick Star. Come on up, Patrick!
[The audience cheers and Patrick walks up to the speaker.]
Patrick: Good evening, ladies and... the other ones. I know you're all excited to see the 400th commercial, but before we see it, I just want to say...
[Patrick looks at SpongeBob, who gives him a thumbs up. Then he turns to the audience.]
Patrick: That...[looks at Don and Mr. Krabs] that...Frozen Krabby Patties are...
SpongeBob: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Patrick: ...Made with sand!
[The audience gasps in shock.]
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] Oh, no!
[Mr. Krabs faints in Don's arms again.]
Don Grouper: That was cute when you were rich. [drops Mr. Krabs and surrenders with his hands up guiltily] I'm out of here.
[Don leaves the stage as the audience vomit out sand. In doing so, their butts shrink down to their normal size. The scene changes to a graph of the Frozen Krabby Patty sales going down.]
Perch Perkins: And in shocking news today, it has been revealed that Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand.
[As everyone is watching the news, various people vomit out sand and their butts shrink back to normal. One of which vomits out palm trees. Another vomits out patty-shaped sand. Another vomits out sand shaped like a rectangular box. Another vomits sand through his eye sockets. Another vomits out sand with a snail in it. Then their butts begins to shrivel up afterwards. Not wanting to take this anymore, the customers decided once and for all to throw away all of the frozen patties they bought. Mr. Krabs is seen near a trashcan, depressed. The Krusty Factory is being closed down and pushed away by construction workers.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's gone. Everything I spent me life building is all gone. I'm ruined. [sobs] What?
[Mr. Krabs peeks into the Krusty Krab and sees customers eating the handmade Krabby Patties and are enjoying them.]
Harold: Now that's the taste I remember.
Mr. Krabs: That's strange.
[Mr. Krabs walks into the restaurant and sees all of the automatic robots being thrown out.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what is going on in here?
Squidward: Uh, [mechanical-like] I am Animatronic Squidward. I cannot answer questions.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward!
Squidward: [regular] It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are in the kitchen making Krabby Patties, sharing the same pants they wore in the beginning. Mr. Krabs walks in.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, did you do all this?
SpongeBob: Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped.
Patrick: A friend always helps. It's called "frelping," and I was very frelpful.
Mr. Krabs: But how did you get these customers to eat Krabby Patties? They know they're filled with sand.
SpongeBob: The frozen ones are, but these are made fresh.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Fresh?
SpongeBob: Go on, have a bite.
Mr. Krabs: No, no I—
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, just a nibble.
[SpongeBob spreads the patty on Mr. Krabs' face. Mr. Krabs takes a taste of the juice.]
Mr. Krabs: Here!
[Mr. Krabs nibbles on the fresh patty.]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor. [rubs his face] The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?
SpongeBob: Nothing, we're not selling them.
Patrick: Yeah, we just give them away.
Mr. Krabs: [freaks out] Agh, SpongeBob, me boy, you've done a good thing here, lad, but you could use a little frelp, I think. [jumps into the pants] How about we partner up, and I become your boss and pay you minimum wage while I work you mercilessly? What do you say?
SpongeBob: Yeah! The Krusty Krab is back in business!
Mr. Krabs: Great, now get back to work! [laughs]


[The episode begins at Sandy's treedome at night. Sandy is leading her Science Scouts on a very important mission.]
Sandy: All right, Science Scouts. One last check on supplies. We all need to be prepared for a campout on the moon. [points to SpongeBob] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [digs into his backpack and pulls out a pack of Fizz Bomb Cola] Six-pack of Fizz Bomb Cola. [pulls out a bubble wand] Bubble wand. [blows a bubble shaped like the Moon and pulls out a tank top] Mesh tank top. [purrs] And I'm waiting on a Krabby Patty delivery.
Sandy: Well, that's not what I had in mind when I said supplies. How 'bout you, Pearl?
Pearl: Oh. [digs in her bag and pulls out pom-poms] Pom-poms, [pulls out a megaphone and screams in SpongeBob's face] megaphone, and spirit! [jumps and shakes the treedome, knocking everyone over.]
Squidina: Uh. Do you always have to rub it in my face that you're a cheerleader?
Pearl: [rubs pom-poms on Squidina's face] Yes I do! [blows raspberry]
Sandy: Scouts, I don't think you cotton to what we're doin'. We're going to the moon!
[Bubble Bass shows his butt outside the treedome.]
SpongeBob, Pearl, &amp; Squidina: Eww!
Bubble Bass: Huh? [pulls up his pants] Mm! [scoffs and leaves]
Sandy: No, that moon. [points to the moon in the sky]
SpongeBob, Pearl, &amp; Squidina: Ohh!
Sandy: Squidina, what did you bring?
Squidina: [digs in her bag and pulls out a pair of glasses] Eyeglasses, [pulls out comic books] comic books, [pulls out action figures] and action figures.
Pearl: Ugh, can a person be any nerdier?
SpongeBob: I can. [holds up an ugly picture of himself]
Pearl: Ew!
Sandy: Remember, Scouts, we're scientists. Let's behave like it.
[SpongeBob washes his tank top, hangs it on the clothes line and blows bubbles through the holes.]
SpongeBob: Science!
Sandy: [grumbles and opens the door] Everyone on board for lift-off.
[Squidina and Pearl enter the tree. Pearl's enormous head gets stuck in the door and Sandy pushes her in.]
Pearl: Ouch!
Sandy: Let's go, Scout!
SpongeBob: But I'm still waiting for my Krabby Patty delivery guy.
[Sandy takes out her telescope and looks through it. The moon moves directly to the right spot where the X is.]
Sandy: The moon is in perfect position for us to launch. [puts her telescope away] We gotta leave now! [grabs SpongeBob and drags him in her tree]
[Outside the treedome, someone is ringing the doorbell. It turns out to be Squidward, who was supposedly delivering a Krabby Patty to SpongeBob.]
Squidward: Hello? Delivery. [grumbles and enters the treedome] Did someone order a Krabby Patty? [walks over to the picnic table and leaves the delivery there; he picks one of Sandy's records and looks at it] Uhh. Yuck. Hokey hoo-ha for hicks. [the treedome starts to shake and Squidward starts to panic] Ahh! I take it back! I could learn to like songs about tractors...maybe.
[Sandy pushes some buttons on her control panel, which causes a shaking motion that scares her scouts.]
Sandy: Uh, sorry about that. Just some backfire is all.
SpongeBob: Safety first.
[Squidina and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. SpongeBob attempts to fasten his, but his seatbelt rolls back. He attempts to tie the seatbelt in a knot, but it unravels and slaps him in the face.]
SpongeBob: Uh, why you! [pulls his seatbelt up, but gets all tangled up in it]
Sandy: Uhh, everything okay back there, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob gives Sandy a thumbs up after getting tangled up by his seatbelt. The seatbelt untangles him and flips him in his helmet. Sandy pulls out a lasso and ties SpongeBob down.]
SpongeBob: Thanks!
Sandy: Three, two, one, launch! [pushes the lunch button and it flips over, revealing a sandwich, an apple, and a carton of milk] Whoops! Lunch. [pushes the launch button]
[The treedome begins shaking and is about to launch into space. Squidward runs to the door and attempts to leave, but the vibration makes him fall over. The treedome, now redesigned as a rocket ship, blasts off from the ground and starts flying. Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob's faces distort as the rocket launches upward. SpongeBob laughs and Squidward's face distorts as well. Squidward crawls over to the dome's glass and sees Bikini Bottom getting smaller below him. The rocket emerges from the ocean, exits the Earth's stratosphere, and directly heads into outer space. Squidward panics, screams, and runs around like crazy. But suddenly, he starts floating since there is no gravity in space.]
Squidward: Eh, did I die? Am I a ghost? [screams as he floats around]
Sandy: [turns off the rocket's engines] Okay, Scouts, you're free to move about the cabin.
SpongeBob: [starts floating] Ooh, whoa! I'm flying, I'm flying! [his skirt falls down, revealing his underwear] Whoop! [covers his underwear and laughs]
[SpongeBob's helmet falls off. Then SpongeBob's eyes, nose, and mouth fall off his body while he laughs.]
Sandy: [checking the peanut plant's pulse] This peanut plant's pulse is staying steady in zero G.
Pearl: I've never been so light before. [spins around uncontrollably, flies directly into some wires and gets zapped by them; she sighs and chuckles]
Sandy: Uhh, I gotta fix that.
Squidina: [playing with her action figures] Teenage Action Girl, rise to the rescue of Action Dog while Teenage Action Boy floats in the corner and mopes. [imitating] I don't care. Oh, no! Help me! [Pearl floats past Squidina, almost knocking her over] Hey! Watch it, you big orca!
Pearl: You watch it, you big dorka!
[Squidina blows a raspberry. Meanwhile in Sandy's treedome, the record playing begins playing country music. The tree's acorns. the running wheel, the Fixin' to Go Nuts record, and the picnic table are floating everywhere. Squidward is cowering in fear, completely unaware of the fact that he is in outer space.]
Squidward: There can only be one explanation. I've lost my mind! [starting to lose sanity] All those years working at the Krusty Krab and I finally snapped! [hits his head against the glass and floats down] Ohh, going crazy is actually a relief. [sighs] All my stress is gone. [spins an acorn on his tentacle; suddenly, the rocket is getting hit by asteroids and space junk outside; Squidward screams in panic] All my stress is back!
Sandy: Uh-oh, we've got space junk! [hops into her chair and begins pushing buttons on her control panel] Everybody, back in your seats. Trays in upright positions. Head between your knees. Your mama can't save you now!
[SpongeBob, Squidina, and Pearl sit back into their seats and fasten their seatbelts. The rocket continues flying through the asteroid belt despite getting hit by space junk. A bowling ball crashes into the window and Sandy hits it back outside with a bat.]
SpongeBob: [cheers with Squidina and Pearl] Home run! [whistles]
[Sandy closes the damaged window with a pair of trousers. The rocket safely makes it out of the asteroid belt.]
Sandy: We've still get a few Astro Belts to get through. Brace yourselves for the cold belt!
[The rocket flies directly into the cold belt, which is a ring of snowmen, igloos, freezers, and icebergs. Squidward floats around while frozen in a block of ice. SpongeBob is building a snowman version of Patrick Star and laughs. Pearl and Squidina hover themselves and shiver. Sandy is wearing a warm coat and holding a mug of hot chocolate. She looks out through the telescope.]
Sandy: Next up, we got a hot belt!
[The rocket flies directly into the hot belt, which is a ring of flaming asteroids and stoves. SpongeBob's Patrick-snowman melts from the hot belt's heat.]
SpongeBob: Patty melt. [chuckles]
[Sandy breathes heavily and fans herself with her tail; she goes to look through the telescope, but burns her hands]
Sandy: Ow! [blows her hands, looks through the telescope and sees the radiation belt up ahead] Huh! We're going through the radiation belt! That could cause mutations! Everyone, get under your lead blankets!
Pearl: [gasps] Mutations?! I must protect my beautiful face! [puts a lead blanket over her]
[SpongeBob pulls a lead blanket out from his bag and puts it over him. The rocket flies directly through the radiation belt. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob take cover under their lead blankets. SpongeBob sticks his hand out from under the blanket and his hand becomes mutated. SpongeBob laughs and his hand roars. His hand begins gnawing on his helmet.]
SpongeBob: Aww. [chuckles]
[Back in the treedome, Squidward begins to suffer from the effects of the radiation belt. The belt's effects mutates Squidward's body into different shapes.]
Squidward: Oh, good Neptune! I'm going through puberty again! [his body keeps changing shapes and he shrinks into a baby version of himself]
[The rocket makes it safely through the radiation belt and resumes flying to the moon.]
Sandy: Okay, Scouts, it's all safe now. [Squidina, Pearl, and SpongeBob uncover themselves; pulls down her telescope] Let's see where we are. [looks through] Craters, craters—[a giant eyeball appears] Oh! Giant eyeball? Now I'm as confused as a goat on Astroturf. [hears SpongeBob laughing outside] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [appears outside and looking through the telescope] Hey, there's a tiny little squirrel in here. [Sandy is angrily wagging her tail] How'd you get in there, you little fuzz ball?
Sandy: I love the guy, but if his brains were dynamite, he couldn't blow his nose.
[The rocket lands and makes a successful touchdown on the moon's surface. The rocket deploys its anchor so it won't float away. Back in the treedome, Squidward pops out from under the picnic table.]
Squidward: Huh? We've stopped. It's all over! I'm back home! [laughs as he runs to the front door; he exits the dome and begins walking, but he floats downward since there's no gravity; he then notices the planet Earth in front of him] Wait a minute. That's the Earth. And that down there is the moon? So, somehow the treedome flew here. [looks down] Good Neptune, I'm falling! Wait, if I remember my high school science, on the moon, I'm much lighter than on Earth. Which means...ha! This fall won't hurt me.
[But unfortunately for Squidward, as he lands on the moon and despite the zero gravity, he ends up getting crushed and smooshed into his helmet. He starts waddling around on the Moon's surface until he trips and falls into one of the moon's craters. He gets up and pulls himself together from the fall's impact.]
Squidward: [blubbers as he shakes his head] Oh, shrimp. Now where am I? Maybe this is the way out. [peaks through the tube and ends up in the desert; a vulture looks down and screeches at him; and pulls his head back from the tube; he runs over to another one] Maybe this one? [peaks through the second tube and ends up in the guitar of the cowboy squirrel]
Country squirrel: Are y'all ready to go nuts for some hokey hoo-ha?
[The crowd cheers. Squidward screams and pulls himself back from the tube.]
Squidward: [walks over to another tube] Third time's a charm? [peaks through the tube and ends up in Rodger Bumpass's storyboard drawing, he and Rodger scream at each other; he pulls himself back from the tube and runs off]
[Back on the moon's surface, Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina exit the rocket and make their first steps on the moon.]
Sandy: One small step for a squirrel...
SpongeBob: Ooh! [goes to exit the rocket, but trips; he falls on top of Pearl and Squidina and they crash into Sandy's pile of camp supplies] One giant leap for SpongeKind. [laughs]
[Sandy activates her camp supplies and all of the tents get set up for camp.]
Sandy: All right, Science Scouts, everyone's got an assignment. Pearl, you measure the moon's gravity.
Pearl: Rah, rah, sis, moon, bahhh! [floats upward]
Sandy: Squidina, you collect moon rocks.
Squidina: Way ahead of you, Ms. Scout Ma'am Cheeks! [throws a moon rock and starts looking for more]
Pearl: [emerges from underneath a large moon boulder] Grrr-avity!
[Squidina sighs and continues her search on more moon rocks.]
Sandy: SpongeBob, you can search for intelligent life.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye! Hmm...mmm...
Sandy: You do know how to recognize intelligent life, right?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure. [holds up a saw] I cut open their heads to see if they have any brains.
Sandy: [sighs, takes the saw, and gives SpongeBob a horn] If you find anything, just toot. [SpongeBob takes the horn and floats away with it] Now to study the moon's gravitational effects on my nuts. [walks over to her gravitational experiments and begins her tests]
[Squidina continues gathering moon rocks until Pearl rubs her pom-poms on her face.]
Pearl: I'm number one! You're number two! I'm gonna beat the nerd out of you!
Squidina: [huffs] No one beats the nerd out of Squidina! [throws a moon rock at Pearl]
Pearl: Whoa! [ducks from the incoming moon rock] Missed me! [laughs and blows a raspberry]
[Squidina's moon rock float around the moon and hits Pearl in the face.]
Squidina: Science! Yay!
[Meanwhile, Squidward runs out from the moon's crater and boards it shut. He pants from exhaustion, throws his hammer away, and looks at the Earth again.]
Squidward: Well, maybe being on the moon isn't so bad. After all, [takes out a tape measure and extends it] SpongeBob is over 238,000 miles away. [pauses and lets go of the tape measure]
Random citizen: [gets hit by the tape measure] Ow!
Squidward: [gasps] This moon is a no SpongeBob zone! [places a flag with a "No SpongeBob" sign on the moon's surface] Here, I'm the man on the moon! [his outburst creates a really loud echo; it was so loud that SpongeBob even heard it]
SpongeBob: [pulls out a plastic ear and sticks it on his helmet] Um, did someone say, "Man on the Moon?" [looks in the crater] Hello? [stands on a stalagmite] Intelligent life? [peaks out from the crater] How about average smarts? [his bottom sticks out from another crater] I'd settle for common sense! [sighs until he sees Squidward's footprints on the moon's surface] Ooh! Intelligent footprints. [follows the footprints and climbs over the cliff, where he sees the Krabby Patty delivery Squidward was supposed to deliver; he walks over to the bag and honks the horn] Huh? [honks the horn once more] Wha-hoo! [marches around while honking the horn] I found it! I found it!
Sandy: [pants as she arrived] What'd you find, SpaceBob?
SpongeBob: Intelligent life. [honks the horn and points to the bag]
Sandy: [digs into the bag] I'm not so sure about that. [pulls out a Krabby Patty] If they were intelligent, they would have eaten this Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Ooh! Mmm, speaking of eating [his stomach rumbles]
Sandy: You're right! It's lunch time. [puts the Krabby Patty back in the bag] Would you mind fetching the lunch I prepared?
SpongeBob: You bet! Just call me LunchBob.
[SpongeBob begins running in place while floating. Sandy pushes SpongeBob down to help him walk on the moon's surface.]
Sandy: Just press the button labeled "lunch!"
[Meanwhile, Squidward is skipping around on the moon's surface like an stupid idiot. He believes that SpongeBob doesn't exist on the moon and is completely unaware that he's already on it.]
Squidward: No SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no SpongeBob, no Sp—[stops at the dark side of the moon] Whoa! The dark side of the moon. [whimpers and peaks into it] SpongeBob? Are you in here? [pulls his head back out] No SpongeBob. [blubbers as he shakes his head] I have a strange feeling suddenly coming over me. Could it be...that I'm...happy? [stupidly walks into the dark side of the moon]
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is inside Sandy's rocket trying to figure out which button is the lunch button.]
SpongeBob: Lunch, lunch, where's lunch? Oh, there it is. [accidentally pushes the launch button and activates the rocket's engines]
Computer: Preparing to launch.
SpongeBob: No! [frantically pushes the launch button to stop] No, not launch! Lunch! [grabs a screwdriver and tries to pry the button off]
[The rocket reactivates itself and starts to fly away. The anchor hooks itself on the moon's crater and begins pulling the moon into a different direction.]
Pearl: Uh, wait, wait—what's going on? [falls over]
Squidina: [whimpers] How should I know? [falls over]
Sandy: You guys wait here! [climbs up the anchor's chain, enters the rocket and stops the engine] Phew! SpongeBob? [sees SpongeBob outside the rocket] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, Sandy! [chuckles] Hey, girl. I was just gonna run back home. I forgot, uh...my reading glasses. [sighs and pants while running in space]
[Sandy activates a lasso, grabs SpongeBob and drags him back into the rocket.]
Sandy: It's okay, SpongeBob. It's my fault for putting the launch and lunch button so close together. [looks at the monitor] Oh, no! The moon's been pulled out of its regular orbit. That could have disastrous effects on the Earth's tides.
[Back on Earth and without the moon in its regular orbit, the ocean's tides are lowered. Bikini Atoll has no water and the ocean level in Bikini Bottom is decreasing.]
Nat Peterson: Water's a little dry today.
[The Bikini Bottomites are doing all that they can to stay alive as long as they can from decreased ocean level.]
Sandy: And that last launch depleted our fuel.
Santa: [off-screen] Ho-ho-ho.
Sandy: That's weird.
[Back on the moon, Pearl and Squidina hover together.]
Squidina: [pants] I'm so sorry you're a cheerleader!
Pearl: I'm sorry you're a nerd!
Pearl &amp; Squidina: That came out wrong! [cries]
[SpongeBob and Sandy arrive back to Pearl and Squidina.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, moon hugs! Make room for me. [hugs Pearl and Squidina] Come on, Sandy, bring it on in. [pulls Sandy in]
Sandy: It's all right, Scouts. We just gotta figure out a way to get back to Earth.
Pearl: But Sandy, we heard strange laughing coming from...[points to the dark side of the moon] in there.
Santa: [off-screen] Ho-ho-ho.
[Squidward appears from the dark side of the moon while being held by a mysterious being.]
Pearl, Squidina, Sandy, &amp; SpongeBob: Huh? [gasps]
SpongeBob: Squidward? You're the man on the moon?
Squidward: SpongeBob?! [sighs in defeat] Of course. Why not?
[The mysterious being comes out from the dark side of the moon. The being turns out to be none other than the jolly old elf himself: Santa Claus. Santa drops Squidward down.]
Squidward: Ohh! [falls on the moon's surface and gets crushed and smooshed in his helmet again] Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Santa: [notices SpongeBob] SpongeBob? Ho-ho! I should've known you'd have something to do with this.
SpongeBob: Santy Claus! Well, Santa, you know the saying, where SpongeBob goes...
Santa: I know, trouble follows.
SpongeBob: I was gonna say laughter follows. [laughs]
Sandy: Mr. Claus, what are you doing on the dark side?
Santa: The dark side of the moon is the only place dark enough for me to get any sleep. [holds up a book and shows a picture of himself sleeping in his sleigh] I was sleeping like a baby—visions of sugar plums. [turns the page and shows picture of Squidward stumbling in Santa's sleigh] Then this bad boy goes and bangs into my sleigh and wakes me up!
Squidward: Well, I guess I'm getting nothing for Christmas...again.
Santa: [notices the Earth is far away] Holy night, SpongeBob! Did you shrink the Earth?
SpongeBob: [stammers nervously] Good question, Mr. Claus.
Sandy: We're actually further from the Earth now. We could have moved the moon back into its regular orbit if we hadn't run out of fuel. [looks angrily at SpongeBob as he whistles nervously]
Squidina: A controlled explosion might move the moon back.
Pearl: [blows her bubble gum and pops] Ha, you're so smart. How do we do that?
[SpongeBob strains himself as he thinks. He comes up with a really good idea and forms into a lightbulb. He takes out his pack of Fizz Bomb Cola.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! Fizz Bomb Cola! A burp explosion in every can.
[Sandy, Pearl, and Squidina grab a can of Fizz Bomb Cola. SpongeBob opens his can.]
Sandy: Yee-haw! That's my Science Scouts!
[SpongeBob, Pearl, Squidina, and Sandy open a hole in their helmets and start drinking their soda. The soda's chemicals build up in their stomachs. They all take off their helmets and make the loudest belch in order to move the moon back into place. But nothing happens, since the moon is too heavy to move from such force.]
Sandy: No go, the moon's too heavy. [belches and cover her mouth]
Santa: [laughs] I think some children might be needing some brains for Christmas. [chuckles]
[Pearl, Squidina, and SpongeBob came up with a different idea. They form a sail using their clothes in hopes of blowing the moon back into its orbit, leaving themselves in their underpants. They hoist the sail up with the mast.]
Squidina: Perfection!
SpongeBob: Now we just wait for a gust of wind.
[They wait for a gust of wind. But since there is no air in space, nothing happens.]
Sandy: Uh, interesting science fact: there's no atmosphere on the moon, therefore there's no wind.
[Santa laughs really hard which causes his belt buckle to fall off.]
SpongeBob: [dodges Santa's belt buckle] Why don't we just push the moon back?
[Sandy, Squidina, Pearl, and Santa look strangely at SpongeBob. SpongeBob warms up and attempts to push the moon back with all his might. Squidina and Pearl attempt to do the same, but the moon is too heavy for them to move.]
Santa: [laughs] You all should be a sea monster because you're Kraken me up! Get it? Kraken? [laughs]
Sandy: [hops on his sleigh and grabs his beard] Santa Claus, you can do more than just say, "Ho-ho-ho!" at us! You can dig into that toy sack of yours and find something to help!
Santa: But I'm having such a jolly, holly time! [Sandy grumbles angrily at Santa] You're right. I'm being naughty, not nice.
[The scene changes back to Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Squidward, Squidina, and Pearl fasten their seatbelts. Santa peaks in the rocket through the window.]
Santa: Everyone nestled all snug?
Sandy: We're all snug, Santa. But why is SpongeBob with you?
SpongeBob: [sitting in Santa's sleigh] Yeah, why am I riding with you? Not that it isn't a pleasure.
Santa: I want you close to me so I can keep an eye on you. You're a menace! [flies his sleigh above Sandy's rocket; SpongeBob falls on Santa's face, but Santa pulls him off] First, I'll push Sandy's rocket ship out of harm's way. SpongeBob, hand me that jack-in-the-box.
SpongeBob: [digs in Santa's sack and pulls out a jack-in-the-box] Jack-in-the-box.
[Santa winds up the jack-in-the-box and launches it at Sandy's rocket. The toy pushes the rocket off the moon's surface.]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh! Let me try! [begins winding the jack-in-the-box]
Santa: Be careful! Don't overwind it!
SpongeBob: But it's gotta be strong enough to move the moon. [carelessly overwinds the jack-in-the-box really tight; the jack-in-the-box stops winding and breaks]
Santa: You broke it, and it was my last one.
SpongeBob: Hmm. [the handle begins turning slowly] Oh, wait. I think I can hear the last note struggling to get out. Come on, Jack, you can do it. I believe in you!
[The jack-in-the-box launches out from the box in a fast pace.]
Santa: Ho-ho-ho-ho!
[The jack-in-the-box hits the moon. But instead of moving it back as it was supposed to, it ends up destroying the moon completely. Various moon rocks float in all directions. SpongeBob and Santa stare in shock.]
SpongeBob: What happened? [Santa grumbles angrily at SpongeBob] Oh. Okay, sorry. It was my bad.
[Moon rocks and debris fly around Sandy's rocket. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, and Squidward look in shock now that the moon is destroyed. Back on Earth and with the moon gone, the ocean level has decreased even more and there is nothing but standing water. Bikini Bottomites are now crawling on their legs and arms.]
Frankie Billy: [runs into Martha Smith] Oh, excuse me. Sorry. [chuckles]
[Frankie Billy gets up and dries up from the heat so Martha can walk by. Back in space, Santa is overwhelmed at what SpongeBob did to the moon.]
Santa: Oh-oh-oh.
SpongeBob: Oh-oh-oh?
Santa: Ho-ho-ho backwards. [sulks on his sleigh]
[SpongeBob thinks and comes up with an idea to fix this problem once and for all.]
SpongeBob: [leans closer to Santa's ear] Santa, do you have any water shooters in your bag?
Santa: Yes, the whole sack is full of 'em.
[SpongeBob digs in Santa's sack and finds a pile of water shooters. SpongeBob grabs a water shooter and gives it to Santa.]
SpongeBob: All right, Santa, squirt me.
Santa: [takes the water shooter] Oh, I get it.
[SpongeBob takes off his helmet and Santa sprays SpongeBob with water to make him bigger.]
SpongeBob: Whoo! Keep 'em coming, Santa!
[Santa grabs another water shooter and sprays SpongeBob with water to make him even more bigger. Back on Earth, the Bikini Bottomites are flopping around due to the decreased water level. But then, something miraculous happened. The water level rises up and the oceans are back to normal. Sandy's rocket flies back down to Earth and Sandy's treedome flies back into its rightful place on the ground. Sandy, Squidina, and Squidward exit the tree.]
Sandy: Using the leftover Fizz Bomb Cola made an excellent rocket fuel, Science Scout Squidina.
Squidina: Yep, the rocket burped us back. [laughs]
Pearl: [pulls herself out of Sandy's tree] Wow! Would you mind teaching me some nerdy science stuff?
Squidina: Sure, if you'll teach me some airhead cheerleader stuff.
[Pearl and Squidina, who have now put aside their differences, skip happily out of Sandy's treedome, nearly knocking over Sandy and Squidward.]
Sandy: Why don't you join the Science Scouts, Squidward?
Squidward: No, thanks! Science is crazy and filled with lunatics! [leaves in disgust]
Sandy: Speaking of luna, I wonder how old SpongeBob is doing.
[The scene changes to New York City at night. SpongeBob, now as a temporary moon until Santa creates a brand new one, rises in the night sky and look down at the city.]
SpongeBob: Good night, Earth! Hey, I'm mooning you. [laughs] Hello, lady. You sure look lovely by moonlight.
Lady: Aww!
SpongeBob: Hey, mister! I can see your bald spot.
Man #1: Hey!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Don't be alarmed, people. I'm only here 'til December, when Santa brings everybody a new moon for Christmas.
[The citizens on the ground are honking their horns and groan as they start complaining.]
Man #2: Come on!
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry. Just gave away the big surprise, didn't I? Oh, well. Merry early Christmas!
Santa: [flies past SpongeBob with his sleigh] Ho-ho-ho! You're a menace!
[SpongeBob giggles and winks at the audience, ending the episode.]


(at Shady Shoals rest home)
Grandma Plankton: How about a little more, Plankton, or has this old granny had enough for one night?
Plankton: Oh, Grandma, you know I always have more pudding for you!
Grandma Plankton: Oh, that looks simply delightful!
Plankton: You once told me that this was your favorite flavor growing up as a child.
Grandma Plankton: Ration?
Plankton: Uh, no, chocolate. Open up! (feeds the pudding to Grandma) You can let go of the spoon now, Grandma. There. Oops, looks like you've got a little on your face. Here, let me. (wipes off the pudding) There you are. There you are, darling.
Grandma Plankton: Oh, Plankton. You always were my favorite granddaughter!
Nurse: Five minutes until bedtime, Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: Well, Grandma, that's the sweetest, most tender...
Nurse: Five minutes, Mr. Plank...
Plankton: I heard you the first time! Now, where were we? (Grandma is asleep) Grandma, don't forget your teeth.
Grandma Plankton: (spits out teeth and coughs)
Plankton: Ooh. Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax. There, there. (Grandma is asleep) That's perfect! (puts the teeth in his mouth) Perfect! (laughs evilly) Why didn't I think of this before? No one can say "No" to a helpless little grandma! (thinking. He is at the Krusty Krab. 'female voice) Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients. You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?
Mr. Krabs: Goodness, no! (gives the formula to "her") Here you are.
Plankton: Thanks, Sonny! I'm just going to take it home; I left my bifocals there. (laughs evilly as imagery fades) '(Bubble transition)
SpongeBob: La-la, la-la, la-la! La-la, la-la, la-la! (playing in the bathtub. He shoots a squirt of water with his hands. The squirt of water goes through his holes at the top of his head then lands on the bar of soap) Yay! A direct hit! (uses a bar of soap as a walkie-talkie) Threat neutralized, Captain. ... Roger. Over. ... Uh-huh. Right away, Captain. All hands, prepare to dive! Repeat: prepare to di-- (Plankton, disguised as Grandma knocks on the door. He clears his throat) Hi, lady!  
Plankton: (female voice) Why, SpongeBob. Don't you recognize me?
SpongeBob: Ehh, not really...
Plankton: It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!
SpongeBob: (gasps) Quick, come inside! (inside of the pineapple) Wow, my very own great-grammyma. Why have we never met?
Plankton: I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... (stammers) I mean...
SpongeBob: I'm so glad you came back... (rubs his finger across Plankton's chin) ...Double-Great Grammyma. (Plankton pushes it away and shudders) You're cold. Let's wrap you up in something nice and cozy. (Bubble transitions over to Plankton wrapped up in a blanket on a couch) Okay, lean forward. (Plankton grumbles as he does so. SpongeBob puts a pillow behind his back) There we go, now lean back, Grammyma. It's the coziest pillow I have. (Plankton does so but sinks into the pillow. He is yelling from it. SpongeBob reacts) How about we look through some old family photo albums? (SpongeBob runs to get them but Plankton is still stuck in the pillow. Cuts to SpongeBob laughing) Here's a picture of me when I developed my first appendage. (a picture of flattened SpongeBob tied to a balloon) Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma? 
Plankton: It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more recent affairs, like where you work, for instance.
SpongeBob: Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry. I've got pictures of that too... (shows stacks of photo albums) ...but we have a couple more from my early childhood to get through first.
Plankton: Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation. (it is night which turns to morning and rooster crows everyone up. SpongeBob and Plankton are asleep. SpongeBob wakes up and exclaims. He looks happily at Plankton)
SpongeBob: Great-Graaaaaaamyma...?                                                                              
Plankton: Huh?!? Oh, I had the most horrible dream of my life! I was dressed up as...! (looks up to see SpongeBob still looking happily at him) Holy mother of Neptune, it's true.
SpongeBob: Good morning. I'll go and fix us a nice breakfast, and then we'll spend the whole day together!
Plankton: Uh, sounds delightful. (takes off glasses. evilly laughs) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. (puts on more lipstick. Bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking down the street)
SpongeBob: So, Grammyma, what kinds of things do you active seniors like to do?
Plankton: Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to see your life, remember?
SpongeBob: Hmmmm... (flashback of Plankton)
Plankton: I want to know all about your life—your job, where the secret formula is... (stammers) I mean...
SpongeBob: (goes back to the present) No, you couldn't possibly care about any of that stuff. Your life must be way more full and exciting.
Plankton: Well, uh...
SpongeBob: (grabs Plankton by the arm and carries him) Come on, it'll be fun! (Bubble transitions over to the place called "Grandma's Tea House." SpongeBob drinks tea) Ahhh. Isn't this tea delicious, Grandma?
Plankton: Why, yes! (drinks the tea then spits it out on a coaster) How can you drink this dreck?! (all of the grandmas gasp) Heh, heh, heh, heh... What I meant to say was, "More, please." (bubble transitions to other grandmas and SpongeBob knitting) 
SpongeBob: Knitting circles sure are fun, eh, Grammyma?
Plankton: Nope. (he has his arms in a yarn circle)
SpongeBob: Why are you not having fun?
Plankton: Why?! Because I don't knit, you nitwit! (his yarn circle gets pulled and so does he by a grandma)
SpongeBob: Are you sure? 'Cause you make a real nice scarf. (Plankton is knitted into a scarf. Bubble transitions over to Plankton and SpongeBob playing Canasta. Plankton puts down a Joker card with his cards the A of clubs, the two of spades, and the five of diamonds) Oh, Great-Grammyma, you win again. All hail the great Canasta "masta"! (Plankton takes his Joker card and rips it in half and throws it on the table) Grandma, you getting bored?
Plankton: No, I'm getting hungry. I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs. I could eat a village!
SpongeBob: Would you settle for a Krabby Patty?
Plankton: (reacts) Would I? (laughs. Then laughs maniacally. He clears his throat) Uh, yeah, I would. (bubble transitions over to SpongeBob and Plankton walking to the front entrance of the Krusty Krab) Uh, SpongeBob, would you mind terribly if we used the rear entrance? I'm a little shy around new people.
SpongeBob: Hmm... Hey, Grammy, do antenna run in our family?
Plankton: Antenna... What?! No, I...!
SpongeBob: (laughs) Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ah, she really is shy. Nobody ever uses this door except for me and... (Squidward bursts open the front door holding a garbage bag) ...Squidward!
Plankton: AAAH!
Squidward: SpongeBob, you have been warned about lurking back here on your days off!
SpongeBob: I'm just bringing in my great-grammyma for some lunch.
Squidward: Your what?
SpongeBob: My great-grammyma! (points to Plankton but he's not there) She must be hiding. Well, she did say she was shy.
Squidward: Right... (starts dumping the garbage in the trash can) SpongeBob, I promise not to tell Mr. Krabs about this if you promise that I don't have to see you again for the rest of the day. (Plankton is hiding in the trash can. He gets a lot of garbage all over him. He starts coughing. SpongeBob walks over to the trash can)
SpongeBob: Grammy, there you are. I was starting to worry.
Plankton: Never mind. Just get me into the kitchen! 
SpongeBob: (cuts to him and Plankton walking in the kitchen) Well, here it is.
Plankton: At last!
SpongeBob: Grandma, I'm just gonna go make sure the restrooms are stocked. You, know, real quick—it's part of my day-off duties.
Plankton: Okay. I'll be standing right here when you get back, and not off somewhere snooping around for the secret formula or anything.
SpongeBob: Ha, ha, ha... What?
Plankton: Nothing, go ahead! (laughs menacingly. He pulls out a green balloon which is a decoy of him dressed as Grandma. He stretches it then blows it up) Let's see how this decoy floats your boat. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! (the balloon floats away and goes above Plankton who is checking under the dirty plates for the formula. The balloon lands in the drain of the sink)
SpongeBob: Okay, Grammyma, that's taken care of. I... (calls) Grammyma! She must've made her own way up to the cash register all by herself! Maybe I'll catch up on my dish-washing while I have the chance. (walks to the sink) The Krusty Krab manual says it is always a good idea to start by turning the garbage disposal on, just in case there is any leftover rubbish in the sink. (turns the garbage disposal on. The balloon starts ripping into a million pieces) Sounds like there's something stuck in the si- Grandma! (the balloon finishes ripping. Plankton looks up) Oh, I can't bear to look! (starts crying. Plankton thinks for a bit) Oh, Double-Great-Grammy-Grams, you were so soft and fragile like a... like a... like a... like a balloon!
Plankton: SpongeBob, SpongeBob, up here!
SpongeBob: Grandma, is that you? Are you all right?
Plankton: Oh! I'm all right, but I've been ground to a pulp. If only there was a nice, cool, safe place nearby, like a safe nearby, where I could rest and recover.
SpongeBob: Well, there is the safe where Mr. Krabs keeps the Krusty Krab secret formula that Plankton's been trying to steal for the past bunch of years, but I don't think he'd mind if my dear old grammyma rests in there.
Plankton: Why would he?
SpongeBob: (carries Plankton over to the safe. He opens the safe which is filled with coins and cash. He puts Plankton on top of a stack of cash) Here you go. I'll come back for you a little later.
Plankton: Oh, I feel better already. (begins snoring)
SpongeBob: Sweet dreams, Grammyma. (closes the safe. Plankton starts laughing menacingly. He gets up)
Plankton: Sweet dreams, indeed, fool. Only this dream is about to become a nightmare, for Mr. Krabs! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...! (Grandma Plankton's teeth fall out) I'm just going to savor this moment, because for once in my life—for once in my life—I feel truly alive! (Grandma Plankton grabs her teeth)
Grandma Plankton: Plankton! (Plankton gasps. Grandma Plankton takes her glasses off his face) You've been a very naughty boy, Plankton!
Plankton: B-But-But-But I... (Grandma Plankton takes her wig off his head) Grandma, I can... (Grandma Plankton takes her dress off Plankton's body)
Grandma Plankton: I've been looking all over for this stuff!
Plankton: Grandma, I can explain!
Grandma Plankton: (grabs Plankton by his right antenna and drags him out of the kitchen) I'm sure you can. Plankton Jr., you know you always were a... (stops at one of SpongeBob's feet)
SpongeBob: Grandma? (gasps) You caught Plankton! Let me guess—trying to steal the secret formula, right?
Grandma Plankton: Get out of my way, rapscallion! (SpongeBob does so) I've had enough foolishness for one day. (Plankton groans. Grandma Plankton drags him out of the Krusty Krab. The episode ends)


[SpongeBob is standing on a hill looking at his grandma's house]
SpongeBob: There it is! Grandma's house! What wonders await me today? Fresh-baked cookies? Story time? A sweater with love in every stitch? Aw, what am I waiting for? [runs down the hill] Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!
Grandma: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi, Grandma! [hugs her as the two walk into the kitchen]
Grandma: Come in and sit for a while. [gives SpongeBob a plate of cookies] Have a cookie, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea. [grabs a cookie and dips it in a glass of  milk] Oh yeah... [eats it. His eyes turn into cookies] Grandma's cookies...
Grandma: Now, who wants to lick the spoon? [SpongeBob raises his hand]
SpongeBob: Me, me, me! [cut to Grandma telling SpongeBob a story while he licks the spoon]
Grandma: ...and then we drove all the way home with all the windows down in the freezing cold.
SpongeBob: Tell me another story about when I was a baby. [cuckoo clock strikes three. SpongeBob gasps] Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work!
Grandma: Hop in my car, I'll drop you off. [cut to Grandma driving up to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Grandma! [hops out of the car]
Grandma: SpongeBob, you forgot your kissy-kissy! [SpongeBob turns around and heads back to Grandma. Squidward is watching from the window]
SpongeBob: I sure did. [Grandma gives him a kiss, leaving a pink print on his forehead of her lips] Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride. [Squidward opens the door for SpongeBob] Thank you, Squidward. [walks inside while whistling to some laughing from everyone] Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today.
Squidward: I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you.
SpongeBob: Did I do something funny?
Squidward: Your forehead. [points to the kiss]
SpongeBob: My forehead is funny?
Charlie: Hey, hey, Grandma's boy? Kissy-kissy-kissy! [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma.
Charlie: No, especially if you're a big baby who wears diapers! [everyone laughs] And sucks his thumb, and plays with dolls, and, um... [soon, everyone stops laughing] ...wears pajamas with feet in 'em, and carries his, um... blankie around, and...
Customers: All right already!
Squidward: Cheer up, SpongeBob. I know someone who still likes you.
SpongeBob: Really? You do, Squidward?
Squidward: Yeah, your grandma! [everyone laughs. SpongeBob tries getting the kiss off with his hand and a mop but nothing seems to work. Everyone is still laughing at him]
All: HaHaHaHaHaHa!!!
SpongeBob: STOOOOOP IIIIIIIIT! [everyone stops] I have been publicly humiliated for the last time! [runs home crying. Fade to SpongeBob's house]
Patrick: I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Me, too.
Patrick: You're the most adult person I know.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick: You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her.
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick.
Patrick: Have I ever not been right? [cut to a picture of SpongeBob on a giant red firecracker, a picture of SpongeBob with a giant funnel in his mouth while Patrick holds a giant pumpkin, and a picture of SpongeBob and Patrick in black speedos while a wolf whistle is heard in the background] You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one.
SpongeBob: Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how.
Patrick: Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest. [SpongeBob obediently puffs out his chest] Now say, "tax exemption!"
SpongeBob: "Tax exemption!"
Patrick: Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz. [jazz music plays] ...Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready! [cut to both walking up on the hill facing Grandma's house] This is it. What are you gonna tell Grandma?
SpongeBob: I'm a grown up!
Patrick: No ifs, ands, or buts about it!
SpongeBob: A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do!
Patrick: And then you get behind her and I'll push!
SpongeBob: Patrick, we didn't say that!!!
Patrick: Oh yeah, right.
SpongeBob: All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake. [takes out a suitcase] I've been growing these babies for years...! [opens it to reveal sideburns. Both of them take a pair and put them on]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Sideburns! [SpongeBob knocks on Grandma's door]
Grandma: [opens door] Oh, hello, SpongeBob. What a nice surprise. Come here and give your Granny her kissy-kissy. [as she is about to kiss him, SpongeBob puts on a helmet to block it]
SpongeBob: [removes his "Kisses Not Allowed" helmet off his head] Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop.
Patrick: Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff.
SpongeBob: He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way.
Grandma: Oh, you are absolutely right.
SpongeBob: I am? I mean, of course I am.
Grandma: You will definitely not be treated like a baby around here anymore ever again.
SpongeBob: I am glad you see it my way, grandmother. [puts on a hat]
Grandma: Well, I'm glad that's settled. [holds out a tray of cookies] But what am I going to do with all these fresh baked cookies?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat... [notices Patrick isn't there] ...rick? [cut to Patrick sitting at the kitchen table]
Patrick: Keep 'em coming, Granny! [scarfs down the cookies as SpongeBob watches from a window]
SpongeBob: So much for no more baby stuff.
Grandma: And don't forget the cookie-eating hat! [puts a red hat with springs attached to yellow smiley faces on top of Patrick's head. They both laugh]
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby.[growls in frustration] [knocks on the door. His Grandma opens it]
Grandma: Well, look who's here. It's my big old adult grandson.
SpongeBob: Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick. [runs up to Patrick, who still eats his snack] [whispering loudly] Patrick! What are you doing?! Cookies?! Warm milk?! A bib?! [points to it, which reads "I heart Grandma"] Is that a kissy mark on your forehead?! We are supposed to be adults! [bangs on the table]
Grandma: Oh, oh, no roughhousing with a full tummy. [tickles Patrick] Who's the baby?
Patrick: I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby! [SpongeBob clears his throat] Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you. [takes out a pipe and blows bubbles from it] Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup. [Grandma comes back with more cookies]
Grandma: Here's a fresh batch of cookies.
Patrick: All right! [eats them] Rewards, huh?
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, there's, eh... [sees Patrick eating cookies with his mouth open] well, let's see, we... [a cookie rolls over to his side] We went over the jazz... [Patrick grabs the cookie and eats it]
Patrick: Oh, Grandma, I'm full. [Grandma sets down another plate of cookies]
Grandma: More cookies! [Patrick uses his mouth like a vacuum and eats all the cookies. One of the cookies rolls over by SpongeBob's side. He whistles for a brief second, then checks his wristwatch]
SpongeBob: It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do. [Grandma takes the cookie away]
Grandma: Oh, you don't want this baby food. How about a big piece of steamed coral? [gives him the coral]
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, uh... great. [takes a couple bites of it] Nutritious.
Grandma: Storytime! [Patrick runs to Grandma]
Patrick: Oh, boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!
SpongeBob: Storytime? [Patrick is sitting on Grandma's lap, ready to hear a story]
Grandma: You'll enjoy this, Patrick. It's a wonderful story about a magical sea leprechaun. [SpongeBob walks in] Oh, SpongeBob, you wouldn't be interested in this baby book. [drops a giant book on the floor] Here's the technical manual on routine active maintenance.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh... great. Yeah. [opens the book] Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it. [while eating a cookie, Patrick bites his finger leaving a big red bruise]
Patrick: [acting like a 2-year old] D'oh! My wittle finger! [sobs]
Grandma: Hold still, hold still. [kisses his finger] All better?
Patrick: [talking normally] Sorta.... [holds up his other finger] this finger hurts a little bit too. [SpongeBob is angry at what he sees then covers himself with the book he was reading]
Grandma: How about I give you a present? [SpongeBob then uncovers himself and sees Patrick with the present]
Patrick: Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies! [opens up the box, then the box cover lands on SpongeBob's head to find a sweater, but puts it on his head] ALRIGHT! Another hat!
Grandma: No, Patrick, it's a sweater.
SpongeBob: [Removes the box cover from his head] Huh?
Grandma: With love in every stitch.
SpongeBob: No... [imagines himself in the sweater instead of Patrick. The sweater tears in half] Don't I get a present, Grandma?
Grandma: Oh, I almost forgot. [hands him some office supplies] Here's some office supplies. I didn't wrap them. I knew you wouldn't mind. [cuckoo clock strikes three again] Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work. Bye-bye, SpongeBob.
[Patrick gets the sweater on] I'll bet you'd fancy a nap, huh, Patrick? [Patrick yawns] You still here, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work.
Grandma: [puts a blanket over Patrick as he lays on the couch] No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do.
SpongeBob: Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later.
Grandma: Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yep, that is it. Here I go.
Grandma: Come again if you get the chance. [SpongeBob opens the door]
SpongeBob: Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater.
Grandma: Toodleloo.
SpongeBob: I don't know when I'll be back.
Grandma: I know how busy you are.
SpongeBob: So, uh... that's it. [Patrick is sleeping]
Grandma: Shh, he's asleep. [SpongeBob slowly closes the door]
SpongeBob: Soooo loooong... [closes the door but then opens it with sad eyes. His sideburns fall off of his head. He starts throwing a big tantrum] I DON'T WANNA GROW UP! [holds up a giant chocolate chip cookie and snaps it in half in front of his face] I want cookies! [holds up a giant baby bottle with milk inside] and "milkie"! [wears a sweater] I want a sweater with love in the stitches! [runs around wearing a diaper with a blue pin on it as he's putting powder in the diaper] I wanna wear "diadies"! [rides in a wagon] I wanna ride in my wagon! [holds his giant teddy bear] I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins! [rides his old rocking horse with a sailor hat on and a lollipop] I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey! [holds up his bruised finger] And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo! [wailing and falls the floor, slamming his fists on the floor. He then rolls like a wheel. Grandma is shocked and sad for him. SpongeBob, sitting, sprays his tears in his mouth. Grandma thinks for a second. SpongeBob continues sobbing hysterically as he ratchets like a lawn sprinkler, almost spinning around and sprays tears everywhere. He spins even faster and floods the whole house]
Grandma: Take it easy, SpongeBob. [picks up the still-crying SpongeBob] SpongeBob. SpongeBob! [SpongeBob continues sobbing. Grandma holds his lips, stopping SpongeBob's crying] You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love.
SpongeBob: [sniffles as he starts to feel a bit better] I don't?
Grandma: Of course not. [pulls the plug under the tears to drain it] No matter how grown-up you get, you'll always be my little baby boo. [Grandma tickles SpongeBob, then kisses his forehead] And remember, you can kiss your grandma and still be an adult. [hands SpongeBob his sideburns and a chocolate chip cookie] Here you go. [SpongeBob puts on his sideburns and eats the cookie]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Grandma. [bites the cookie] Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?
Grandma: No problem. [she hugs SpongeBob. Outside, Squidward and everyone else are laughing]


[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket. Plankton puts on a belt, fires up his flamethrower, puts on his wielding mask, and lights up candles with his flamethrower. He jumps onto the tub, turns the faucet prepares a nice, warm mud bath.]
Plankton: [spins with the faucet and flies off] Wah! [crashes into a bouquet of roses, making petals fly all over.]
Karen: [relaxing in the tub with mud as Plankton massages her wheels] Oh, Sheldon. You're so romantic.
Plankton: It's all about you today, Karen.
Karen: Oh, this makes up of a lot of your stupidity lately, Plankton.
Plankton: [dressed in a handsome outfit] Plankton's stepped away for a moment. The name's Ray Ray, and I am at your service, m'lady. [spins Karen's wheel] Pow!
Karen: [wipes the cucumbers and lotion off the screen and shows lips puckering up] Oh, kiss me, pipsqueak. I mean, Ray Ray.
[Plankton and Karen are about to share a kiss. When suddenly, the screen turns off and turns on to show Plankton's grandmother, Lily Plankton.]
Plankton: [sees his grandmother on Karen's screen] Grandma?! I told you never to call me on this screen.
Lily Plankton: Sheldon, [lifts her glasses] is that you?
Plankton: [takes off his suit] Yes, it's me, Grandma. Always nice to hear from you. Okay, gotta go. [pushes Karen]
Lily Plankton: Okay, sweetie. See you tomorrow at 8 AM sharp.
Plankton: Right, see you then. Wait a minute, what? 8 AM? Um, what's happening at 8 AM, Grandma?
Lily Plankton: Don't you remember, silly?  You promised me you'd own [holds up a picture of the Krusty Krab] the Krusty Krab by my 90th birthday. Well, my 90th is tomorrow! You do own the Krusty Krab now, right?
[Plankton gets a bit nervous. But inside his brain, a tiny version of himself blows up a mountain to form the word, "lie."]
Plankton: Lie, that's it! [zooms back to Plankton] Uh, you're darn right I own the Krusty Krab, Grandma, and I can't wait to give you the grand tour, uh, tomorrow morning.
Lily Plankton: Aww, see you then.
Karen: [turns off screen and smacks Plankton] That smack was for Plankton. [shows Ray Ray on the screen] Now bring back Ray Ray. [puckers up]
Plankton: Oh, what am I gonna do, Karen? How am I gonna fool Grandma tomorrow?
Karen: Oh, okay, I guess bath time is over. [steps out of the bath tub and wraps a towel around] Why don't you and Ray Ray take a long walk off a short plank?
[Karen turns her screen and kicks Plankton out with a boot. Plankton flies out of the Chum Bucket and lands onto the ground.]
Plankton: [gets up] Gotta think, gotta think. [pulls out his brain attached to his antennas] Come on, brain! [smacks it, beats it up, and swallows it back in his head through his eye]
SpongeBob: [holding an arrow] This way to the Krusty Krab! Pull right in and order a Krabby Patty! [flips the arrow around and around; he throws it in the air] Whoo! [he bounces the arrow on his butt] Whoop, whoop. [flips it over] Ooh. [spins it with his tongue] Aah. [he throws it in the air, making it fly up to the surface and it goes back down again; SpongeBob continues to play with the arrow until he gets tired] Whew. '[throws it up again, but it falls on his head] Ow! [gets up and struggles to pull it out]
Plankton: SpongeBoob, you gotta help me.
SpongeBob: [pulls the arrow out] Sorry, Plankton, what can I do to help you?
[The arrow falls on top of Plankton.]
Plankton: [gets up with the arrow] This is not an evil scheme. [uses the arrow to explain his dilemma to SpongeBob] The truth is I promised my grandma I would own the Krusty Krab by her 90th birthday. So, I need Krabs to play pretend tomorrow and fool my grandma into believing I'm the new owner, otherwise she will think I'm a big loser. Got it? [throws away the arrow]
SpongeBob: [his face spins after Plankton finishes, but stops it on time] Well, I believe you, Plankton, but I'm not sure Mr. Krabs is gonna buy it.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not gonna buy what?
French Narrator: One Pathetic Sob-Story Later...
Mr. Krabs: I ain't buying it! This whole grandma thing sounds just like another phony plot to steal me formula.
Plankton: I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to this, Eugene, but... [rips his body open to reveal his sweet, innocent self inside; his innocent side whimpers with his eye wide open]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] SpongeBob, there's something wrong with his eye.
SpongeBob: That's Plankton's rarely seen sincere face, Mr. Krabs, and it means for once he is telling the truth.
Mr. Krabs: [teary eyed] You know, [shows a tattoo of his grandmother on his chest] I have a grandma too.
SpongeBob: Aww.
Mr. Krabs: [sobs] All right, I buy it. [SpongeBob gasps]
Plankton: Thank you.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs opening the safe in the office.]
Mr. Krabs: First things first. [takes the formula and swallows it; he closes the safe] That should keep it safe for six to eight hours. [speaks through megaphone] All right, me pretties, let's make this place pro-Plankton pronto! [flicks Plankton]
[SpongeBob kicks Mr. Krabs' desk and replaces it with a smaller desk for Plankton. Plankton puts the name plate with the word, "Owner" on his desk. Squidward replaces the cash register with a Plankton-themed one. Mr. Krabs takes the cash register and swallows it. SpongeBob replaces the Galley Grub menu with the Planky Plates menu. Squidward puts up the banner with the words, "Happy 90th B-Day" on it. SpongeBob swallows some balloons and blows them up inside his body. He float in the air with the balloons. Squidward and SpongeBob cover the word, "Krab" with a plank that spells "Plankton" on the Krusty Krab sign. A customer throws away his food in a Plankton-themed trash can. SpongeBob puts Plankton hats on the heads of three customers. SpongeBob replaces a couple's soda with a Plankton-themed soda cup. SpongeBob paints the tables to look like Plankton's eye. SpongeBob and Squidward paint the outside of the restaurant to make it look like Plankton. Mr. Krabs puts the sign, "Plankton Owner" on his office door.]
Mr. Krabs: Now everyone remember, for the rest of the day, Plankton is the— [stammers] Plankton's boss.
[A bus pulls over at the Krusty Krab, now the Krusty Plankton. Lily Plankton comes out and meets up with Plankton and Karen.]
Plankton: Hi, Grandma. Happy birthday.
Karen: Nice to see you again, Grandma Plankton.
Lily Plankton: [lifts her glasses] Ugh. Who invited C-Pee-Eww? [laughs]
Karen: [feels rejected] All right, I tried. [she leaves angrily, running Plankton over]
Plankton: Owuh! [unsticks his squished body from the road] Let me help you with your bag, Grandma. [gets smacked in the face by Lily's purse] Ouch!
[Plankton escorts his grandmother into the restaurant.]
Plankton: Well, here we are, Grandma. Welcome to the Krusty Plankton. I named it after you.
Lily Plankton: [pinches Plankton's cheek] Oh, well, aren't you a sweet grandson? [sees SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs] Who are they?
Plankton: They're just my employees, Grandma. Meet SpongeBob and Eugene.
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Hello, Grandma Plankton.
Lily Plankton: They look like very nice boys, and I'll bet they're even nicer when they're working.
Plankton: You heard, Grandma! We ain't running a welcome wagon here! Get back to work!
[SpongeBob runs back and forth until he jumps back into the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Yeah, sure thing, Plankton.
[Mr. Krabs laughs until Plankton pushes a bucket of cleaning supplies onto Mr. Krabs, making him fall flat on his face on the floor.]
Plankton: [pokes Mr. Krabs' eye] That's Mr. Plankton to you, busboy.
Mr. Krabs: [sarcastically] Sorry, Mr. Plankton. It won't happen again. [pushes himself away]
Lily Plankton: [sees Squidward sleeping] Oh, look, that one's napping on the job.
[Plankton and Lily hop onto the table Squidward is sleeping on.]
Plankton: [loudly] Nap time's over, loafer!
Squidward: [gets up] Okay, who's the wise guy?
Lily Plankton: [becomes head-over-heels with Squidward] Ohh. [sees a vision of Squidward being a very handsome man] Oh, my goodness! Who is this handsome young man?
Plankton: Oh, that's Squidward. He's nobody. Moving along...
Lily Plankton: [jumps on Squidward's nose] Mm. Squidward. Didn't we meet at an early bird dinner?
SpongeBob: Ooh, I think someone has a not-so-secret admirer! [laughs until Lily whacks him with her purse] Ow! [flies back into the kitchen]
Squidward: [takes Lily off his nose] All right, lady, I don't normally say this, [drops Lily on the table] but get off my nose.
Plankton: [quietly] Go along with it, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: [quietly] Or you're fired.
Squidward: [sighs and puts Lily back on his nose] So, Grandma Plankton, where have you been all my life?
Lily Plankton: [chuckles] Call me Lily. [kisses Squidward]
Plankton: Okay, Grandma, you're embarrassing me now.
Lily Plankton: [hops onto Squidward's head] To the kitchen, Squidward.
[Squidward grumbles and carries Lily into the kitchen, much to Plankton's delight. The scene changes to SpongeBob cooking patties on the grill.]
Plankton: Try one of our Planky Patties, Grandma. Fresh off the grill.
[SpongeBob flips a patty. Plankton holds up the buns, adds condiments to the patty and makes the perfect sandwich.]
Lily Plankton: [takes out her false teeth] I'll need my teeth for this. [drops them] Whoops. [her teeth drops onto the grill and it melts] Oops. I dropped my choppers. Oh, well. I guess Squidward will have to chew it for me.
Squidward: Oh, sure, I'll—what?! [Mr. Krabs opens Squidward's mouth] Aah.
[SpongeBob throws the patty in Squidward's mouth and Mr. Krabs forces him to chew it.]
Lily Plankton: [chuckles] That's it, chew it up real good. That's enough. My turn.
[Mr. Krabs forces Squidward to stick out his tongue.]
Squidward: Aah.
[Plankton pushes Squidward's tongue upwards and feeds his grandmother the chewed up patty.]
Lily Plankton: Aah. [eats it up and swallows it] Delicious.
SpongeBob, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton: [disgusted] Ew!
Lily Plankton: Oh, Sheldon, you've outdone yourself. You really are a master chef.
[Mr. Krabs grumbles and knaws on his claw in anger. The scene changes to Lily getting ready to leave.]
Lily Plankton: Thank you, Sheldon. [pinches Plankton's cheek] You've really made my birthday something extra special this year.
Plankton: All right, Grandma. [gives his grandmother her purse and she heads out the door] Got your bag? You are out the door and that is that.
Lily Plankton: [comes back in] Oh, just one more thing.
[SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward groan.]
Lily Plankton: My last birthday wish is to get a photo of me posing with the Krabby Patty secret formula.
[Plankton makes that sweet, innocent face again.]
Plankton: [whimpers] Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Fine. Anything to get that bag with the bag out of here. [pulls off his head, digs in his body and gives Plankton and his grandmother the formula; Plankton groans as the formula crushes him]
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward: [holding cameras] Say cheese.
Plankton and Lily Plankton: Cheese.
[Suddenly, Lily's purse turns into rocket boasters and flies away with Plankton and the formula.]
Lily Plankton: Ahhh!
[SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward scream.]
Lily Plankton: [laughs] Finally, the secret formula is mine!
Mr. Krabs: I knew your sincerity was insincere, sir!
Plankton: I didn't know anything about this, Eugene, honest! But I love it! Now we can rule the world as a family, eh, Grandma?
Lily Plankton: [laughs maniacally with Plankton] Sorry, Sheldon, but I'm not sharing the formula with you! [kicks Plankton off]
Plankton: [falls] But Grandma! [falls on a packet of ketchup]
Lily Plankton: Adios, mi amour! Mmmm. [blows a kiss onto Squidward, causing him to fall over]
[Lily laughs maniacally as she leaves the restaurant through the roof.]
Plankton: Why? Why did I lie? [pulls his antennas off his head]
SpongeBob: Why? Why did I pretend? [twists his body]
Mr. Krabs: Why? [opens his empty chest] Why did I give her my formula?
Squidward: [speaking on the phone] Why? Why wouldn't we be open on Tuesday? Idiot! [hangs up the phone and pouts]
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton: What have we done?
[Lily Plankton flies over to Shady Shoals Rest Home with the secret formula and sits on her chair with it.]
Lily Plankton: I have the secret formula! [laughs] This world is mine!
[Lily daydreams about being an evil, tyrannical overlord with Squidward as her husband. They are sitting on top of the Krusty Krab, now Granny Plankton's Krabby Patties. Below the restaurant, SpongeBob, Plankton, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Sandy and everyone in Bikini Bottom grovel over her as if she is their lord and mistress.]
Everyone: [chanting] Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!
Lily Plankton: [chuckles] Darling, [pokes Squidward on the head with her staff] why don't you toss the peasants a little something?
[Squidward throws a patty down to them. Everyone goes for the patty and starts fighting over it.]
Fred: My leg!
[Lily laughs maniacally, but falls asleep. As she sleeps, everything goes back into reality. Unknown to her, Plankton, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are watching her sleep.]
Mr. Krabs: [takes the formula and replaces it with prune juice] I'll take that, thank you very much. [swallows the formula] Safe and sound.
Plankton: [covers his grandmother with a blanket] Happy birthday, Grandma. [kisses her as she whacks him with her purse, knocking out several of his teeth]


Mr. Krabs: Hey, I'm expecting a fifty cent rebate check. Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie.
Mailman: Sorry. No check. But I've got this. [gives Mr. Krabs a bottle and walks away]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh? [reading] Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard! [not reading. Gasp!] Grandpa Readbeard comin’ bla, bla, bla!
SpongeBob: I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, "The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws." And he wanted me to be a pirate, too.
[He flashes back to when he was a baby. His grandpa was babysitting him on his pirate ship]
Baby Mr. Krabs: [chewing a rattle]
Grandpa Redbeard: [fighting pirate skeletons] One day, you'll be a plunderin' pirate just like yer ol' granddad here.
Mr. Krabs: So I bought me a ship, hired a crew.....
Crew member: Aaarrrrr!
Mr. Krabs: And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound.
Crew members: [lined up to get paid]
Mr. Krabs: I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit. So I fired me crew and sold me ship. ‘Twas also the last time I saw me granddad.
Grandpa Redbeard: Aaarrr, if it ain't me pirate grandson.
Young Mr. Krabs: Well, actually, Grandpa,...I just sold...
Grandpa Redbeard: Ya know how proud it makes me to see me only grandson continuin' in the family business.
Young Mr. Krabs: Yeah, uh, Grandpa...
Grandpa Redbeard: And I'll be keepin' me eye on yer career to see how you progress. Just remember, the only rule in the Pirate's Code of Honor is: Never tell a lie.
[The flashback ends]
Mr. Krabs: For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship.
Mr. Krabs: Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew.
SpongeBob: We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah.
[An hour or two pass]
Mr. Krabs: All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate. [puts a bandana on Squidward] I want you to talk like a pirate.
SpongeBob: Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!
Mr. Krabs: But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate. [smells Patrick] Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship! Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!
[A few minutes pass]
Mr. Krabs: [breaks the bar holding the tableabove the ground. He sticks it in the cash register for a steering wheel]
Squidward: [starts painting the floor of the Krusty Krab black]
Patrick: [hammers two wooden boards together]
SpongeBob: [puts the Krusty Krab sign on the roof]
Patrick: [breaks a wooden board with his hammer]
SpongeBob: [removes the shell from the pole and replaces it with a crow's nest]
Patrick: [breaks another wooden board]
SpongeBob: [pours garbage into a bucket and stirs it]
Patrick: [glues some broken wooden board pieces together]
Squidward: [paints some wave-shaped pieces of cardboard]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls on a rope and releases the Jolly Roger]
Patrick: [glues the final wood piece to the rest to make the rim of the ship]
Mr. Krabs: Way to go, fellars.
Grandpa Redbeard: [swings to the ship] Hee-ar!
Mr. Krabs: He's comin'!
Grandpa Redbeard: Har, har, har!
Mr. Krabs: Hide me, boy.
Grandpa Redbeard: Eugene, me boy! Aye, it's good to see you and yer ship after so many moons! Just beginin' to think you was lyin' to yer old granddad!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I...Heh, heh. So, have ya met me hearties?
Grandpa Redbeard: Hm...this might be a pirate crew. But more miserable jellyfishers than swarvy brine-skimmers.
SpongeBob: Um...
Grandpa Redbeard: Har, har, har! I'm just yankin' yer chain, boy! You look like a fine pirate crew.
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
Grandpa Redbeard: Now, let's see what this rusty old pelican can do! Let's sail!
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Aye, sir!
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Captain! We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast.
Mr. Krabs: Indeed, indeed. And just look at the treacherous surf in our path!
Squidward: [hanging from the front of the ship and moving the pieces of cardboard he painted to make it look like waves]
Patrick: [hanging from the window. He takes a drink of water and spits it on Grandpa Redbeard]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it.
Grandpa Redbeard: Aye.
Mr. Krabs: I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, "Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!"
SpongeBob: Oh! [turns on a record player. It makes wind noises]
Mr. Krabs: There it is! That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it...and, apparently me cabin is haunted as well.
Grandpa Redbeard: [picks up a hair net] What's a hair net doin' on a pirate ship? Every pirate knows that the majority of his daily nutrition comes from whatever hair or skin flakes fall off the coke and into the stew. This hair net is deprivi' your crew of its essential nutrients.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, just a sec. [turns a video projector on] Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack! [The video projector shows a kraken emerging from the water]
Kraken: Grrrrrr....
Grandpa Redbeard: Aye, look at the size of that beast.
Mr. Krabs: Not to worry, Granddad. [grabs a harpoon]
Grandpa Redbeard: Aha! That's the stuff!
Mr. Krabs: [throws harpoon] Yaahh! Uh... good toss, eh, Granddad?
Grandpa Redbeard: Whah!
SpongeBob: [catches the harpoon]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nothing. Look! [The video projector shows a harpoon landing on the Kraken and knocking him underwater]
Grandpa Redbeard: Har, har, har, har! That's me boy!
Mr. Krabs: Clear!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
Patrick: Hooray!
SpongeBob: Woo-hoo!
Mr. Krabs: Sounds like we got a prize. [whispering] Ready, Squidward?
Squidward: You owe me big time, Mr. Krabs. [takes off his bandana and inflates his head]
Mr. Krabs: Ar! Take that, ya, ya scurvy dog! Woo! Check the size of this, Granddad.[He is holding Squidward, who looks like the Kraken] Check the... Granddad?
Grandpa Redbeard: Ahoy! Trouble aproachin' quick! Approximately ten clips of the starboard bow! Man your battle stations!
Mr. Krabs: Oh no. If Granddad sees something, it must be the real deal.
Grandpa Redbeard: What have ya got, cotton in yer ears?! Move!
SpongeBob: [stacks some bags of sand]
Patrick: [raises the Jolly Roger]
Squidward: [reading a book]
Mr. Krabs: What exactly are we dealin' with, Grandpa?
Grandpa Redbeard: Somethin' bigger than I've ever seen! A ravin' garganst comin' by with coarsmatic tangled locks!
Mr. Krabs: [Gasp!] Oh, so depulsive.
Grandpa Redbeard: Yeah. It must be destroyed! Here, see for yourself. [gives Mr. Krabs a telescope]
Mr. Krabs: Go get it, Granddad.
Pearl: Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute. What kinda disgusting, horrible abomination is dare invade me vessel? [looks over the rim of the ship]
Pearl: Dad!
Mr. Krabs: [Gasp!] That disgusting, horrible thing is me daughter!
Grandpa Redbeard: [points a cannon at Pearl]
Pearl: Open up!
Grandpa Redbeard: Prepare to meet yer maker, sea witch.
Mr. Krabs: Nooooo! [puts out the fuse on the cannon]
Grandpa Redbeard: What are ya doin'?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I, oh, I was just checkin' the cannon and makin' sure it was loaded. [The cannon collapses]
Grandpa Redbeard: What is this?!
Mr. Krabs: I can explain.
Pearl: Dad! Dad!
Grandpa Redbeard: Now it's even more angry!
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry! I have it under control! [jumps off the ship]
Pearl: Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Pearl! Could ya pipe down? Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!
Pearl: What's with the lame outfit?
Mr. Krabs: What? Oh, never mind that! [pushes Pearl away] Just go home. [climbs back up the ship]
Grandpa Redbeard: [breaks a cardboard wave]
Mr. Krabs: I bet you're wondering about that.
Grandpa Redbeard: Ar, you're darn tootin' I am!
Patrick: [spits on Grandpa Redbeard]
Mr. Krabs: Do you mind?
Grandpa Redbeard: What kinda ship are you runnin' here?
Mr. Krabs: Just a second. [removes the wind record from the record player and throws it on Grandpa Redbeard's nose]
Grandpa Redbeard: Arrrrrrrrrrrr! Arrrrrrrrrrrr!
Mr. Krabs: Now, Granddad. There's a simple explanation.
Grandpa Redbeard: I've smelled sticky things, but nothin' smells stickier than a lie! The code that all pirates live by, you knows what it is, don't ya?
Mr. Krabs: Of course I do, Granddad.
Grandpa Redbeard: Well, then, say it!
Mr. Krabs: It's, it's, it's a pirate never lies! [starts crying] And I've been a dirty liar! Everything you see is a lie! This sail is a lie! [tears down the sail] This crew is a lie! [rips their pirate clothes, leaving SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward, naked.] Even the ship is a lie! [takes a ball and breaks the roof of the ship, which made SpongeBob, Patrick &amp; Squidward ran away. He destroys the whole ship, leaving the KK standing] All of it! All a lie!
Grandpa Redbeard: Krabby Patties: $2.00. Krusty Combo: $3.99! Coral Bits: $1.95?!
Mr. Krabs: You see, Granddad? I'm no pirate. I'm just a lowly restaurant owner! I'm sorry I failed ye.
Grandpa Redbeard: Fail, me boy?! Ha, ha, ha! Why, I couldn't be more proud. Look at yer ludicrous prices! Now, that's real piracy. Ya done good, boy-o!
Mr. Krabs: Really? Thanks, Granddad!
Grandpa Redbeard: Why, thank yourself, lad! You created this dynasty on yer own! Now, I'll be takin' me lead, boy!
Mr. Krabs: Goodbye, Granddad! What an honest man!
Grandpa Redbeard: [steals Mr. Krabs' money] I hope ya don't mind, boy-o, but I helped myself to a little bit of yer booty! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: I knew I got me talent from someone! [laughs]


Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about...
Squidward: [talks cheerfully as he switches the "Open" sign to "Closed"] Now! 8:00! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is: [pulls out his clarinet] Clarinet. [Tom shows up at the door and knocks on it, causing Squidward to drop his clarinet] What?
Tom: Are you open?
Squidward: [points to the sign] Read the sign.
Tom: [ignores him] I'll have a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a Double Chili Kelp Fries.
Squidward: NO, YOU WON'T. I can't hang out here all night. I've got a life!
Tom: Well, fine, if you don't want my money!
Mr. Krabs: [says cheerfully] Money?! [Mr. Krabs then falls from the ceiling on top of Squidward] You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?
Tom: [pulls out cash; Sadie, an anchovy, and an old man appear behind him] Sure!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, [tears up the "Closed" sign] welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day.
Squidward: What!? [crowd of fish barge in cheering]
SpongeBob: Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life. [leaves]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working! [gasps] It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease! [jumps on cash register counter] Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
Squidward: [Sandals walks up to counter; Squidward hands him a baseball bat] Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.
SpongeBob: Pst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen [laughs] at night!
Squidward: [takes hat off; leans head on counter] Don't hold back.
SpongeBob: [cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen] Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob in the bathroom wiping it clean with himself] Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob at the grill picking up spatula, misses the spatula and hits the grill; screams] I burned my hand!...at night. [cuts to SpongeBob walking on the counter, singing to the tune of Charge] Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! NIGHT!
Squidward: WILL YOU PLEASE?! Here, [hands SpongeBob a bag of garbage] give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!
SpongeBob: All right! [takes bag from Squidward] Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night. [stops at the door] You mean outside?
Squidward: That's where the dumpster is, yes.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward, [leans face against window] it's kinda dark out there.
Squidward: But I thought you liked the night shift.
SpongeBob: You're right! [lifts bag over his head] FOR THE KRUSTY KRAB! [runs out of the building to the dumpster, panicking the whole way] AHHHHHaahhAAAhhhhhhAahhaAAAAAAHHHaaaAaaAAaAhhhhAAhhahahAAHh! [reenters the building panting heavily. He confidently snaps his fingers] Piece of cake.
Squidward: So you're not afraid?
SpongeBob: Pfft, nah.
Squidward: Well I am. Especially after, [looks around, gulps] well, you know.
SpongeBob: [turns around] What? What do I know?
Squidward: You don't remember? It was all over the news.
SpongeBob: Tell me, tell me!
Squidward: No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you. [gives a sympathetic look, then smiles slyly]
SpongeBob: [excitedly] What happened, what happened, what happened!?
Squidward: You mean you've never heard the story of the [thinks] "Hash-Slinging Slasher?"
SpongeBob: The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
SpongeBob: The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, [a boring-looked Squidward frowns] The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.
Squidward: Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha---[breaks into scream] because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!
SpongeBob: [begging] Tell me the story!
Squidward: Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.
SpongeBob: He forgot the secret sauce?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: He didn't wash his hands?
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: Irregular portions?
Squidward: No!! He cut off his own hand by mistake!
SpongeBob: You mean like this? [pulls one of his arms out of socket, another one grows back in its place] Or like this? [pulls it again, another one grows back] Or this? [does it again] Or this? [does it again] But what about this! Or this, or this, or this, or...
Squidward: [interrupts] Except he wasn't a sponge.
SpongeBob: [ask with all his extra hands creating a rainbow-like line] So?
Squidward: So it didn't grow back!
SpongeBob: [screams] OH, NO!!! [all his extra arms lift their hands upwards and run away]
Squidward: And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?
SpongeBob: Tuesday.
Squidward: Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.
SpongeBob: [gasps] But tonight's Tuesday night!
Squidward: Then he'll be coming.
SpongeBob: How will we know?
Squidward: There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First: the lights will flicker on and off. Next...
Harold: [interrupts] Dude, can I have some ketchup?
Squidward: Oh, here you go. [hands him ketchup] Next: the phone will ring and there will be nobody there. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails] And finally: the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over. [shows SpongeBob eating his fingernails, starts eating his arms, the arms regrow and he eats those and then he eats his arms like popcorn] Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead! [SpongeBob begins eating his hands like popcorn] Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand...
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: He opens the door... [pushes his tentacle to SpongeBob's face, making it looking like he's a door that's being opened; while doing this he imitates the sound of a squeaky door opening. leans towards SpongeBob's face, which sinks in] ...he slowly approaches the counter! ["counter" echoes menacingly] And you know what he does next?
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: You really want to know?
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Are you sure you want to know?
SpongeBob: WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DOES HE DO?!?!
Squidward: [sneaks up on SpongeBob, taps him] He gets ya! [SpongeBob now screams repeatedly for about 20 seconds while Squidward is laughing] SpongeBob... [continues screaming] SpongeBob I wa... [screaming continues] I was ju... [SpongeBob's pupils are now screaming too] I was jus... [screaming continues] SPONGEBOB, I WAS JOKING!!
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: It's not true! None of it's true!
SpongeBob: It's not?
Squidward: Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.
SpongeBob: Ohhhhh... [laughs repeatedly like he did with screaming. Cuts into later in the night. Shows Krusty Krab with a big sign that says 'Open Forever']
[Squidward is shown at the counter reading a book. Squidward hears spooky noises and feels water dripping on him but he doesn't know what it is.]
SpongeBob: [on the ceiling wearing suction cups cleaning] Isn't this great, Squidward? [Squidward screams] There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.
Squidward: [says to himself] Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?
[cuts to Patrick's bedroom]
Patrick: [Patrick's alarm clock goes off] Oh, boy! Three A.M.! [whips out a Krabby Patty and starts to eat it; cuts back to The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here! [lights start to flicker on and off] Very funny, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: "And the lights will flicker on and off," just like the story. I get it. [realizes no one is flickering the light switch and looks shocked]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?
Squidward: I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day! [phone rings, Squidward picks it up] What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: [walks up to the counter] Nice try, Squidward.
Squidward: Nice try, what?
SpongeBob: "The phone will ring and there will be no one there." [raises eyebrows up and down and giggles] Oh, you crack me up.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm not doing this. [hangs up phone] Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights, [lights flicker on and off] and the phone, [phone rings] ...and the walls will ooze green slime?!?! [walls start to ooze green slime] Oh, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing? [hears a motor, turns his head and opens his eyes wide; a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab doors]
SpongeBob: [walks up to the counter] I didn't know the buses ran this late. 
Squidward: They don't! [a man gets out of the bus and the bus pulls away, all Squidward and SpongeBob can see is his spooky outline]
SpongeBob: Well, they're dropping someone off. [from the outside, the man lifts his spatula]
Squidward: [screams to the point where hair grows from his head and starts wiggling] The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...
SpongeBob: The Hash-Slinging Slasher! [starts to cry]
Squidward: At last you understand! We're doomed!
SpongeBob: No, that's not it. [wipes tear] I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me. You must really like me! [cries again]
Squidward: SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One: I hate you. And two: how can that be me when I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE!? [the man taps on the door with his spatula]
SpongeBob:  [screams to the point where his eyelashes grow and start wiggling]
SpongeBob and Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!!!! [the guy walks in the door and up to the counter]
SpongeBob: [Squidward screams] He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!
Squidward: SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!
SpongeBob: Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!
Squidward: Huh? [a nerdy unnamed guy reaches the counter]
SpongeBob: Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!
Richard: Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula. [holds up spatula] I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.
SpongeBob: Do you have references?
Squidward: Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights? [lights flicker on and off; SpongeBob, Squidward, and Richard look over to see a vampire flicking the light switch]
SpongeBob, Squidward and Richard: [playfully] Nosferatu!
Nosferatu: [smiles, light turns off]


[inside Mr. Krabs house]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Me dollar lies over the ocean, me dollar lies over--♪ [sniffing, then exhales. His breath is revealed, which smells like a port. His breath contains a lighthouse and some seagulls. sniffs again] Whoa! Blarney stone, that's a horrible reek. I knew I was forgetting somethin'. [grabs a toothbrush with toothpaste, and sings again] Ohhhhhhh, bring back me money to me! [starts brushing his teeth. A rumble is heard, and one of Pearl's fins breaks through the mirror. Mr. Krabs stops brushing]
Mr. Krabs: That's strange. I'm sure I can remember screwing the cap back on the toothpaste, but here it is on the edge of the sink, plain as day. Heh heh! These are strange times we're livin' in.
Pearl: Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: That sounded like me beloved teenage daughter, Pearl. I'm coming, princess!
Pearl: [groaning]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl! What in the name of Neptune's Aunt Nancy is with all this ruckus?
[Pearl's legs suddenly starts growing, along with her head, her body, her ponytail, and her fins]
Pearl: What's happening to me?! [her mouth grows. Now her weight breaks the bed]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, this is terrible! I paid 30 bucks for that bed! 'Course, that was when you were a newborn. Maybe if I crunched a few numbers and checked the warranty, I could—
Pearl: I [pants] need [pants] food. [continues panting]
Mr. Krabs: [brings refrigerator] Okay, Pearl! I wasn't sure what to get, so I just brought the whole--
[Pearl's tongue grabs the refrigerator, puts in her mouth, and chews]
Mr. Krabs: ...refrigerator.
[Pearl starts to grow some more]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, I somehow just realized what's happening.
Pearl: So did I.
Mr. Krabs: You're havin' one of them, uh, you know, one of them, um, growth spouts. It means you're healthy.
Pearl: It means I need food!
Mr. Krabs: [opens cabinet] Empty! [actually, there are 2 foods available]
Old cracker: What am I, chopped liver?
Chopped liver: No, that's what I am. [rimshot]
Mr. Krabs: [panting]
Pearl: Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Darling, I searched the entire house. There's not a speck of food to be spoken of.
Pearl: Well, you're just gonna have to go buy some.
Mr. Krabs: [panics] Uhhh, can't. It's late, and all the shops are closed. We're just gonna have to wait until morning to find you something to eat.
Pearl: Wait, what's that green stuff in your pocket?
Mr. Krabs: Eh? Where?
Pearl: There! [grabs money]
Mr. Krabs: Me money?
Pearl: I'll just have to eat this.
Mr. Krabs: No, wait! I'll think of something. [walks out of his house] Food. Where? Where? Food. Where? Where? Huh? [sees a fence. He peeks in someone's garden and sees a peanut garden. He gets a basket and grabs all the peanut worms. Inside the house, Mrs. Puff is seen snoring]
Mrs. Puff: [snores] Must protect garden. [snores] Only thing that makes life worth living.
Mr. Krabs: Hehehehehe! Peanuts! [peanuts wiggle] What the... [peanuts pop out their eyes and squirt Mr. Krabs] These peanut worms are pets, not vegetables! [screams and leaves the basket behind]
Mrs. Puff: [opens door suddenly] Who's there? I'm warning you. I have a blunt instrument here, and I'm not afraid to use it. [She sees Mr. Krabs stuck in the fence, trying to escape] There you are, sucker! [throws her crowbar and hits the fence, causing the fence to flip and hit the back of Mr. Krabs. Acting as a boomerang, the crowbar flies back to Mrs. Puff]
Mr. Krabs: [still running] Cucumbers. Squirting me. Flying stuff! [laughing hysterically. He hides in a big rock, only to be revealed that it's Patrick's house. He sees a refrigerator filled with food] Jackpot. [sees Patrick, sleeping with his head on a bowl of Kelpo] Surely Patrick could spare a few morsels. After all, it's for a worthy cause. Me beloved Pearl. [grabs all the food] Don't worry, Pearl, Daddy found you some vittles! [the food is actually sand] Bottom feeders. [He sees Patrick and gets the bowl of Kelpo. He runs back to his daughter, exhausted] Pearl! I brought you some-- [Pearl grabs the cereal] ...cereal.
Pearl: More, Daddy, More!
[cut to Mrs. Puff's house]
Mrs. Puff: [petting a peanut worm] There, there, my darling, the bad man is gone now. And if he comes back, we'll make sure he never walks again!
[two police officers appear]
Officer: Which way did you say the kidnapper ran, Miss, uh, Mrs., uh, Ms., Mrs., Miss, Mrs. [clears throat] So which way did you say he went?
Mrs. Puff: I said he went that way.
Officer: [writes on his notepad for about five seconds] Anything else?
Mrs. Puff: No.
Officer: [writes on his notepad for about five seconds, then taps notepad] Got it. Johnson. [Officer Johnson turns on the flashlight and points it at the fence] Well, looks like whoever it was is gone now, ma'am. Enjoy the rest of the evening. [both walk to their to their police boat] I tell ya, these calls are getting more and more weird. I mean, what kind of nutcase would want to break into someone's vegetable garden at this time of night?
Mr. Krabs: Ooh-hoo-hoo, foo-foo-foo-food. Gotta find foo-hoo-hoo food! [passes the police boat]
Officer: Well, I doubt he's gonna turn up anywhere near here again tonight. What do you say we go check out that new 24-hour taser emporium you were talking about? [drives out]
Mr. Krabs: Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! [passes Squidward's house, then doubles back and sniffs] Food. [uses nose to try to unlock the door. Mr. Krabs sees Squidward sleeping in the bedroom] Not food. [stops and smells the flowers, then continues. He then turns on the light and gasps] Hanging cured meats. Exotic spices. A breadbox overflowing with baguettes. Yummy stuff everywhere! I'll start with the fridge. [opens fridge filled with food] Candied sea yams, pickled urchins, anemone pies, a bucket of kelp slaw.... Et cetera. Ooh, more et cetera. [walks out of the house]
Squidward's house: Oh, well. I needed to lose a little weight anyway.
Officer: [talking to Johnson] And that's what I told him. I said, "If you're not gonna bring an extra set of batteries, then why even carry a--" [sees Mr. Krabs carrying a sack filled with food] Hey mister! What's with the sack?
Mr. Krabs: S-sack?
Officer: Yeah, sack. That big giant sack thing you're carrying on your back, that sack.
Mr. Krabs: It's, uh... I'm, uh, practicing to be "Santy Claws" for the holidays.
[siren on the boat wails. The police drop Mr. Krabs off to his house]
Officer: Okay, you have a safe night now.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks again, officer!
Officer: Be seeing you in a couple months. [chuckles] Happy Holidays.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Pearly, I got some vittles for ya! [Pearl begs to put the food in her mouth. Mr. Krabs dumps all the food in her mouth. Her stomach growls that the scene shakes, then, she burps loudly]
Pearl: More!
Mr. Krabs: I was afraid you were gonna say that.
[Mr. Krabs runs to get some food. He sees SpongeBob's house in front of him. Inside, SpongeBob turns on the kitchen light, where he sees Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: I wasn't stealing food!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs! How could you do this to me?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm sorry, I had no other choice. See
SpongeBob: Coming over for a slumber party without even giving me a chance to put my best PJs on? I mean, look at these things. Just give me one minute to change, and when I get back, we can get started on some s'mores and popcorn.
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles nervously] G-g-good idea, SpongeBob. That sounds just perfect.
Squidward: Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas.
SpongeBob: But I thought he was having a slumber party at my house.
Squidward: I don't care. I'm calling the police. [dialing]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, wait, you can't.
Squidward: Oh? And why is that?
Mr. Krabs: Because if you do, I'll fire ya. [Squidward continues dialing] No, if I go to prison, who's gonna feed Pearl?
Squidward: Hello, police?
Mr. Krabs: Hold it! I'll... I'll...
Squidward: You'll what? You'll give me your golden tooth?
[Mr. Krabs sniffles, and yanks out his golden tooth. He gives it to Squidward]
SpongeBob: I didn't even know Mr. Krabs had a gold tooth.
Squidward: Neither did I.
Mr. Krabs: [sobbing] Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I had a tooth pulled a few years ago. Only hurts for a couple of days.
Mr. Krabs: It's not that, boy. Those nerves died years ago. It's me dear daughter, Pearl.
SpongeBob: Pearl? What happened?
Mr. Krabs: She's going through one of them growth spurts, and I can't find a way to feed her.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you're the owner of the most delightfully delicious restaurant in Bikini Bottom! Why don't you just take her there to eat?
Mr. Krabs: Hold on, boy. I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory.
SpongeBob: You don't have to do that. I know a special ingredient that can make one Krabby Patty taste like a million.
[cut to the Krusty Krab]
Pearl: Oh, Oh! So hungry, not gonna make it!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, hurry it up!
SpongeBob: Hang in there, Mr. Krabs. Almost ready.
Mr. Krabs: You've been saying that for the last-- [SpongeBob appears with the Krabby Patty.. The Krabby Patty is put in Pearl's mouth. She burps]
Pearl: Daddy, I'm not hungry anymore, and I've stopped growing. I feel great. Heh, Heh!
Mr. Krabs: Whew! Boy, I'm glad that's over. And it only cost me one Krabby Patty. Say, what was that secret ingredient you used in there, anyways, boy?
SpongeBob: It was love, Mr. Krabs. It was love.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs, then stops] Eh?

[Mr. Krabs is in his office counting his money]
Mr. Krabs: Four hundred and fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-two, four hundred and fifty three, four hundred and fifty four, four hundred and fifty five, four hundred and fifty si... [hurts himself] Ow! No! [sucks claw] Ooh. [close up on Mr. Krabs' nail] I split me nail. Oh, that looks terrible. [dials number] Hello? It's an emergency! No, I haven't been biting them! [frusturated] No! Can you just schedule me in? [shocked] Now? A manicure right in the middle of the day? [whispers] But what if the guys see me? [stops whispering] Yes, I want my nails to look their best. Be right there. [takes secret underground passage to the front door and bumps into SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ahoy, sir. Where are you going?
Mr. Krabs: Uh. Heh heh. It's a... it's a secret.
SpongeBob: [shocked] You have a secret?
Mr. Krabs: Everybody has a secret, SpongeBob, and mine's gonna take 15 minutes. [looks at his nail] Maybe 20 if she can spruce up my cubicles. [notices SpongeBob is listening and puts his hands behind his back]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir. And who will be "in charge" while you're gone.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, [looks over at Squidward] well, not Squidward. [looks at a customer] No, no, him. [looks at another customer] Too lumpy. [looks at SpongeBob, who shines] Okay, okay, you're in charge.
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: You're in charge for the next 15 minutes.
SpongeBob: I'm... in charge?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, sure, why not? [SpongeBob starts shaking] You okay, boy?
SpongeBob: [flies around, leaving a rainbow trail behind] Yahow! [lands and salutes] I won't let you down, sir.
Mr. Krabs: What a sheesh. I'll be back in 15 minutes [Mr. Krabs leaves, Squidward is sleeping, and SpongeBob wakes him up]
SpongeBob: Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back?
Squidward: Krabs is gone?
SpongeBob: Yep. And I'm in charge for the next 15 minutes.
Squidward: Wow.
SpongeBob: [giggles] Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal around here. I guess that's why Krabs put me in charge. [close-up of Squidward not listening three times] Charge. Charge. [Squidward falls asleep]
Squidward: Wake me up when I care. [SpongeBob looks at his watch]
SpongeBob: Do you care now?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: [looks at the customers and gasps] Heh-heh. Everything is under control, people. Go back to your krabby patties. Nothing your temporary man in charge can't handle. [tries to wake Squidward up] Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squid? Squid? Squidward? Squid? Squid?
Squidward: [yells] What?
SpongeBob: Well, it's just that I'm in charge and...
Squidward: [growls...but then gets an idea] And you ruined my regulary scheduled Krusty Krab nap?
SpongeBob: Regulary scheduled nap?
Squidward: This must be important. Mr. Krabs has never interrupted one of these before.
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: But being as you're the man in charge, you must have your reasons.
SpongeBob: [sweating] Well, I, um...
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: Um, nothing. Carry on. Boy, there sure is a lot of proceedural type stuff I don't know about the Krusty Krab. [Squidward laughs then cuts to the scene where Squidward is watching TV]
SpongeBob: Order up, Squidward!
Squidward: You know, I'll let you serve this one. My stories are on.
SpongeBob: Gosh, I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to cook the patties. [raises his spatula]
Squidward: So do it when you're done.
SpongeBob: And unclog the sink.
Squidward: Would you like to hear a secret?
SpongeBob: [appears right behind Squidward and slightly shocks Squidward] What kind of secret?
Squidward: See that guy over there? [points]
SpongeBob: Yes?
Squidward: He wants to be a fry cook, and you're his hero!
SpongeBob: Me?
Squidward: Why don't you give him a couple of pointers. Let him cook his own patty, and don't take "no" for an answer. He's shy. [laughs] This should be good.
[SpongeBob walks up to Frank and nudges him]
SpongeBob: Hey, buddy. It's me, SpongeBob, fry cook extraordinaire.
Frank: Uhh... Hello.
SpongeBob: I know your secret...
Frank: What? Who told you?
SpongeBob: Oh, a little cashier told me! Follow me!
Frank: Yeah, whatever you say, man!
[he takes him by the hand and leads him into the kitchen]
Squidward: Moron.
[in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Betcha didn't think you'd be in here today, did ya?
Frank: No.
SpongeBob: First off, this is my grill. This is where the magic happens! And this is my actual spatula! [shows him the objects] So start fryin' up some patties! I'll come check on you later, my little prodigy!
Squidward: Ha, ha! SpongeBob will believe anything!
[SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Order #12!
Squidward: SpongeBob, what're you doing?
SpongeBob:  Taking out an order!
Squidward: You're serving Krabby Patties with your hands? Do you know how filthy your hands are?
SpongeBob: They are?
Squidward: But your feet however are clean. Think about it. Your feet have been protected by your shoes and socks all day.
SpongeBob: Oh! [he takes his shoe and sock off, then we see a close-up of his foot with a band-aid, and blisters]. It's all coming clear to me now. [cut to the next scene where SpongeBob is walking on his hands and serving a customer with his feet, on one foot there is a Krabby Patty, and on his other foot there is a drink] There you are. A nice hot meal with sanitary foot service. Here's a nice delicious Krabby Patty, and a large drink. [he puts a straw in the drink by using his toes, then he bends the straw with his big toe, the customer flinches] Enjoy.
Debbie: Hey, is my food here yet?
Frankie Billy: [hands over Krabby Patty and drink] Here. You can have mine.
Delivery Man:  Here are the supplies you've order!
Squidward: What? [delivery man squishes Squidward with the items]
Delivery Man: Please sign here. [Squidward signs his name] Hey, my pen.
Squidward: Oh, sorry.
SpongeBob: Ooh! [sings] It's here, it's here, it's here! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo it's here!
Squidward: What is this stuff?
SpongeBob: Now that I'm in charge, I've decided to decorate the Krusty Krab! I'm gonna make it all pretty!
Squidward: [grunts and gets an idea] Hey, SpongeBob, do you want to hear another Krusty Krab secret?
SpongeBob: There's another secret? What's the secret?
Squidward: Do you want to know how Mr. Krabs gets all these customers?
SpongeBob: How?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs keeps this place a dump, so the food's more better by comparison!
SpongeBob: Sounds like the Chum Bucket.
Squidward: Ah, but you'll be doing it on purpose.
SpongeBob: Ohhhhh... [cut to SpongeBob dumping garbage from trash cans all over the tables while Squidward watches and sipping a soda] How's this, Squidward?
Squidward: Lookin' good!
SpongeBob: You mean, "lookin' bad"! Enjoy our fine decor!
Nat: Next time i'm picking the restaurant.
[SpongeBob mops the Krusty Krab with muck and grime, until it is totally covered in brown goop]
SpongeBob: One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime!
Squidward: Mmm, you missed a spot.
[he mops a customer and his food]
SpongeBob: Got it! [SpongeBob chews gum and spits it on the bottom of the tables] Gum under all the tables! How's that for low expectations?
Squidward: Lower!
SpongeBob: Initiating stage two: collateral damage! [he throws a brick at the window, but it is thick glass and it bounces off and hits him in the face, then, he walks up to Squidward, his clothes tattered, him scuffed up with mangled hat, twisted eyelashes and a black eye] How was that?
Squidward: Perfect!
SpongeBob: Ehh...
[gives a thumbs up and smiles, showing his damaged teeth, one dangling from only a string of his gums]
Harold: This place is disgusting!
Fred: Yeah, let's get out of here, as soon as I finish this delicious Krabby Patty!
[SpongeBob grabs Squidward by the shirt and points to the customers, about to exit]
SpongeBob: Squidward, all the customers are leaving!
Squidward: What did we talk about?
SpongeBob: Don't touch the material.
[lets go of the shirt]
Squidward: If you want the customers to stay, you need to provide some entertainment!
SpongeBob: Oh, can do, Squidward, can do!
Harold: Come on, let's go.
SpongeBob: WAIT!!! You don't want to miss... This!
[he shrugs his shoulders up and flares his hands outwards while jumping and crossing his legs]
Debbie: What's he doing?
Harold: He's... dancing! [he grabs his head by the sides, stands on his tippy-toes and moves his midsection in and out] Ok, people, just back away slowly... [he turns around, thrusts his rear out and kicks back a leg, one at a time, while making funny noises, and everyone backs away, creeped out]
[meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is on his way back to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, there's nothing like polished pincers to make you feel like a man! [he laughs at his own reflection in them] Let's see how SpongeBob's doing as acting manager. [he goes in through the door and is shocked at what he finds] What the...??!! SpongeBob dancing like a goofball?
[back view of SpongeBob leaning forward and swinging his arms]
SpongeBob: And a hey, and a ho, and a hey and a ho! And a hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, ha, hey, hee, ho...
Mr. Krabs: Me customers cowering in fear?
[all the customers are huddled in the far back corner of the building]
Evelyn: Help... us...
Mr. Krabs: The Krusty Krab a filthy mess?
[Frank holds a tray of food with a Krusty Krab hat]
Frank: Order #20 ready for pickup.
Mr. Krabs: [anger rising] And some stranger cooking Krabby Patties??!! [Squidward is asleep in the ordering boat] Squidward sleeping on the job??!! Ok, that's actually normal. SpongeBob! What have ye done to me Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: I was just following Squidward's advice, Mr. Krabs. He told me all your secrets!
Mr. Krabs: All my secrets...? [stares at his newly-polished nails and then nervously hides them behind his back, sweating and chuckles nervously] So, is there anything else I can do for you, acting manager SpongeBob? [cut to Mr. Krabs doing the dishes, he chips a nail again] Ah, Gwenevere!!!
[pan across the restaurant to show that random fish cooking, Squidward asleep, overturned gummy tables with mud everywhere, and SpongeBob dancing in front of fearful customers to Russian music]



Narrator: Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.
Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! [SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air] Let's see here. This weeks hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... [gasps] [shaking nervously]...SpongeBob...! [SpongeBob moves his desk between two rows] It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor.
Jimmy: Mrs. Puff, I've done it already! [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Ohh... Phil?
Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor.
Tina: Hey, I've done it three times already! [SpongeBob moves up closer]
Mrs. Puff: B...uh...B-Beth!
Student: She graduated!
Mrs. Puff: Henry?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Vera?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Clayton?! [SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs] Alright, I guess I have no choice. [gulps] The hall monitor of the day is [she sighs] SpongeBob. [SpongeBob launches into the air]
SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
Mrs. Puff: Okay! Just take the hat and belt. [tries handing him uniform]
SpongeBob: I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech.
Mrs. Puff: You can't make this easy, can you?
SpongeBob: Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Give me a break.
SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... [clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech] ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! [at this point almost everyone, is asleep] Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. [takes out a long roll of paper] "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears." [the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk] In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform [takes out the hat and belt] and assume my duties as... [puts on the uniform] ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! [walks towards the door then turns around] Oh, and I will be re... [bell rings as all students run over SpongeBob]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob: I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
Mrs. Puff: I'm afraid so.
SpongeBob: Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. [takes off his uniform] I hardly knew ya. [gives uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
SpongeBob: A-hoo! [dives into the uniform] Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I've just done? [cut to SpongeBob walking down the street, singing somewhat incomprehensibly. Then notices a broken traffic light]
SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! [directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures, but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end] What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
Fred: My leg! My leg!
SpongeBob: On patrol. I'm on patrol. [notices a house with an open window] Uh-oh, an open window. [peeks through the window and there is a couple eating]
Vera: More seaweed medley, dear?
SpongeBob: The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. [jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask, screaming as he does so] I'm the open window maniac! [both run out screaming] I hope you learned a valuable lesson! [shuts the window and begins walking again] On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... [gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground] Vandals! Another crime. [takes his finger and tastes the pink goo] hmm...strawberry! I must act! [more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick eating some strawberry ice cream] Patrick... [looks around for the voice he just heard] Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick: My ice cream! It's alive! [screams and throws away the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here!
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. [ice cream cone is on SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Patrick. Come down here. [Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'm down here.
Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That's hall monitor to you!
Patrick: Sorry, officer.
SpongeBob: Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
Patrick: What crime? [shows him the ice cream that is on the ground] I'm a bad person! [cries]
Newspaper Boy: [High Voice] Extra! Extra! "Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!" City paralyzed with fear! [gives one to SpongeBob] [Gruff Voice] Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. [runs off] [High voice again] Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob: [reads paper] "Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
Patrick: [still crying] I wanna be good!
SpongeBob: Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. [Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head] Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
Patrick: Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! [both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream]
SpongeBob: Okay, now what?
Patrick: Hmmm... [both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream]
SpongeBob: This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! [takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick grabs one and is elated with joy] And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! [SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick]
Officer Rob: Afternoon, son.
Patrick: Hello, brothers. [salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his cone hat]
Officer Rob: Son, we're looking for the maniac.
Officer John: Have you seen this man?! [He whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.]
Patrick: [screams] It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away!
Officer Rob: Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy. Understand?
Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh.
Officer Rob: Okay. [Officer John shows Patrick the poster again]
Patrick: [screams] Horrible!
[Officer John removes the poster, bemused. He holds up the poster again. Patrick screams again. Both cops then look at each other and smile slyly. Officer John repeatedly shows and takes away the poster as Patrick screams every single time. Eventually, the cops decide they've had enough fun.]
Officer Rob: Stay indoors, son.
Officer John: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. [both laugh as they drive off]
Patrick: [takes out walkie-talkie] SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!
SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared!
SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie, sobbing] I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
Patrick: Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting... [the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark] ...dark.
SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
Patrick: Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. [Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob, but Patrick doesn't realize it] [gasps loudly] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Where is he, Patrick?
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] At the intersection of Conch and Coral. [SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign]
SpongeBob: That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
Patrick: Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly! [screams over walkie-talkie] Get out of there, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams] That's his maniac shriek! He's going to attack! [SpongeBob cries while running around in circles] He's acting all crazy! Run! Hind behind that building! [SpongeBob hides behind the building] No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign! [SpongeBob hides behind the street sign] No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light! [SpongeBob gets under the street lights] No wait, agh, he's there, too! Run for your life! [SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out]
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Say again, deputy?
Patrick: The maniac's in the mailbox! [SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox. He alternates between screaming and crazily jabbering as he runs through three buildings, causing them to topple over and eventually crashes through a fence plasted with wanted posters]
SpongeBob: [takes a look at a wanted poster] Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! [Patrick screams in the background and a mass of police cars surround SpongeBob]
Officer Durado: We'll take that as a confession. [Mrs. Puff appears]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself! [SpongeBob slumps sadly at these words]
Officer #1: You know this guy?
Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility. [the cops glare at her] Uh-oh... [at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV] And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [frowns nervously] Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I'd like to see you after class. Six months from now! [jail closure sound]


[The episode starts off in Larry's Gym at night; the lights turn off, as Frank, the Muscular Goldfish, goes into the arm wrestling ring. The scene then cuts to Mr. Krabs arm-wrestling with a muscular fish.]
Announcer: [from off-screen] Welcome, everyone, to the Secret Anchor Arm-Wrestling Club!
Jim the Wrestler: Yeah! [chest muscles flex]
[Both Mr. Krabs and his opponent are seen struggling to beat each other, groaning.]
Tough Green Fish: Give it up, old man! You're nothing but a softshell, Krabs!
[They are still struggling to beat each other until Mr. Krabs pinches his opponent's hand with his claw. His opponent screams in pain and crashes into the table. The spectators cheer for Mr. Krabs as he smiles smugly.]
Tough Purple Fish: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: I win — again! [laughs] That's me penny-pinching hand. [holds a penny in his claw and laughs]
[The Popeye fish and another tough fish walks in and carries Mr. Krabs's opponent out. Another fish brings in a new table.]
Mr. Krabs: This old soft-shell... is ready to twist another wrist! Who's next? [eyes stretch out to Reg, who declines, and to another tough fish]
Plankton: [from behind the spectators] I am! [spectators gasp and step aside to reveal Plankton] You got a problem with that, Eugene? [to the spectators] His name's Eugene, by the way!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] I got no problem with that, Sheldon. [to the spectators] His name's Sheldon, by the way.
[The Popeye fish and his partner bring in a smaller table and places it on top of the main table. The spectators cheer as Mr. Krabs and Plankton grasp each other's arms. The bell is rang by Larry the Lobster and the fight begins.]
Plankton: It's humiliation time, Krab-cake! I've been working out for months to bring you down! [muscles appear throughout his body]
Mr. Krabs: [struggling] What's — going on here? I can't... hold it —
Plankton: Any last words?
Mr. Krabs: Just... one! [lifts Plankton off the table] Sucker! [squishes Plankton with his claw and laughs]
[The spectators erupt in celebration.]
Jim the Wrestler: Yeah! [chest muscles flex]
Mr. Krabs: Next! [another tough fish arm-wrestles with him]
[Camera cuts to Plankton, groaning while trying to get up from the table, but gets squished again.]
Mr. Krabs: Next! [another tough purple fish arm-wrestles with him]
Plankton: I'll get — [gets squished]
Mr. Krabs: [from off-screen] Next!
Plankton: you — [gets squished again]
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] Next!
Plankton: Kra — [gets squished again] bss...!
Mr. Krabs: [sighs; picks Plankton up and uses him like a towel, then laughs and throws him away] I'm the champion... hands down!
[Mr. Krabs laugh and the spectators cheer for him, while Plankton crawls toward the gym's exit.]
Plankton: I'll get you for this, Krabs! You'll rue the day you —
Jim the Wrestler: [steps on Plankton] Yeah! [chest muscles flex]
[Scene cuts to Plankton crawling to the Chum Bucket, while groaning in pain.]
Plankton: Oh, why do I try to compete with Krabs? He always goes long and I always fall short! Will I ever get the upper hand?
[A scallop poops on Plankton causing him to look up. The scallop lands on the glove on top of the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: That's it! My glove! My big, beautiful, bone-crushing glove! Thank you, clam!
[Plankton is then seen working on the glove on top of the Chum Bucket as a thunderstorm brews in Bikini Bottom. Lightning strikes the glove and Plankton is blasted away; suddenly the glove gains life and starts to move.]
Plankton: The pinky is wiggling... wiggling! [laughs maniacally; the glove lets go of the Chum Bucket handle and jumps in front of Plankton] Let's see Krabs throw down this gauntlet! [boards the glove and rides it like a horse towards Larry's gym] Hi-ya!
[Scene cuts to Larry's Gym, where Mr. Krabs arm-wrestles and defeats other tough fish like Reg and the Popeye fish. Plankton hops onto the table, in front of Mr. Krabs.]
Plankton: I want a rematch, Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [dismisses Plankton] Boring. [shrugs] But whatevs.
Plankton: [pretends to be in pain, clutching his hand] Oh no, not a hand cramp! Not now! [smugly] Luckily I have a last-minute substitution, standing by. [takes a deep breath and blows a whistle]
[The ground rumbles and the Chum Bucket glove punches a hole into Larry's Gym. The glove then flicks the tough fish away with his fingers and makes its way to the wrestling table, about to wrestle with Mr. Krabs. Scene cuts to Larry the Lobster holding the mallet to ring the bell, but he faints onto the bell causing it to ring. The match between Mr. Krabs and the glove begins, and he struggles to defeat the glove.]
Mr. Krabs: [groaning in pain] Eeeh – oh, oh – oh — [Plankton is seen with an evil grin on his face, while Mr. Krabs continues to struggle] Any... last... words?
Plankton: [blows the whistle and the glove hoists Mr. Krabs up in the air] Just one... Sucker! [laughs maniacally while Mr. Krabs trembles in fear]
[The glove spins Mr. Krabs in the air and whacks him on the floor, causing a hole to form.]
Mr. Krabs:  [regains consciousness] Huh –? [shadow forms above him] No, no, no, no, no, no —
[The other tough fish fall above Mr. Krabs as the glove gathers them all into the hole on the floor. Plankton hops on top of the glove.]
Plankton: [raises arms in victory] Ta-daah! Let's give a big hand to the new champion! [applauds; then takes a deep breath and blows the whistle] Okay, move it, filthy fingers! [rides glove like a horse straight to the Krusty Krab] Aww, too bad Krabs isn't here to catch me with my glove in the cookie jar, heheh... Bust the door! [glove punches a hole into the Krusty Krab, flicking away the chairs and tables] Bust this one, too! [glove flicks the door of Mr. Krabs' office and goes in, creating a hole; the safe containing the secret formula is then seen] And now, for the secret formula! Open, said me! [hits glove with a whip but he is blasted off of the glove; the glove then growls at him and he hits the glove with the whip one more time] Go and hand me that, I command you! [glove takes whip from Plankton and he trembles in fear] Please don't hurt me! [glove flicks the whip away] Whew!
[The glove punches a hole into the kitchen and brings Plankton along. Plankton is then dipped into a container of hot sauce; afterwards, the container sizzles and Plankton is blasted off of the container onto the floor. Plankton screams in pain, slaps himself multiple times, afterwards, his antennae fizzles off and he rockets towards the sky. He falls back down into the Krusty Krab kitchen, screaming then groaning in pain.]
Fish #1: [from off-screen] Look out!
[Someone screams, and the glove is then seen leaving the Krusty Krab, flicking random Bikini Bottomites and their vehicles away, with two citizens landing on the Krusty Krab window. A boatmobile lands into the Krusty Krab, and Plankton hides himself after taking a peek at the commotion.]
Plankton: Uh-oh. That glove is gonna destroy Bikini Bottom and I'm gonna get blamed for it! [panics] I hate prison food! But I can't stop that monster all by myself... This is an emergency! [slips onto a puddle and becomes dizzy; his vision gradually clears itself and he sees an emergency box on the kitchen wall] Emergency box... That's convenient! [goes to the emergency box and opens it, revealing SpongeBob inside]
SpongeBob: [laughs; jumps off of the box and gives Plankton a salute] What is your emergency, Sir? [sees Plankton] Oh, hi, Plankton.
Plankton: I need a hand with something, kid. [takes SpongeBob with him, by the hand] Now do it!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Sir... No matter what the emergency, I've seen it all before.
[Scene cuts to the glove holding a boatmobile and controlling it, making it crash onto a Bikini Bottomite's boatmobile. The Bikini Bottomite runs away, screaming, and the glove throws the automobile it's holding onto the abandoned boatmobile. Plankton and SpongeBob are then seen watching the glove from a distance.]
SpongeBob: [screaming] I've never seen that before! [a burning automobile flies past and SpongeBob avoids it; the glove heard growling in the background]
Plankton: Usually it's sitting quietly on top of the Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob: Well, maybe we can talk to it.
Plankton: Talk is cheap! [whips out a stand with a button on top of it] Which leads you to push this button when I say so.
[SpongeBob, looking very excited, tries to push the button but Plankton slaps his hand away. Plankton is then seen boarding a tank loaded with missiles. Plankton aims it at the glove, who is seen crushing a boatmobile.]
Plankton: [shouting] Hey, Fistface! Prepare for annihilation! [to SpongeBob] Push the button, SpongeBob! [laughs maniacally, then pauses] Huh?
SpongeBob: [covering his eyes] Oh, I can't do it, I can't shoot the glove! [hides in his pants and points at the glove] It's – it's wiggling...
[The glove is seen grabbing a bus and squirting its passengers out. The passengers scream and run away as the glove throws the bus away.]
Plankton: [reaches for the button as his missiles point towards the sky] I must push it! [pushes the button and laughs maniacally as the missiles are launched towards the sky] What? [the missiles head down to the ground and hits Plankton and SpongeBob, causing an explosion; Plankton is then seen running on the tank's wheel like a treadmill, with his antennae burning] Why are you here again?
SpongeBob: I'm helping. [laughs; picks Plankton up] Listen to me, Plankton. You can't fight a big monster like that with hate. You can only defeat them with love. [tries to kiss Plankton but is slapped away]
Plankton: [groans in disgust] Love? That's too brutal... Let's do it! [SpongeBob's eyes turn into hearts and accidentally crushes Plankton with his hand]
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Plankton trying to fit into a giant glove.]
Timmy: [pointing somewhere] Daddy, I want it!
Harold: Now, Timmy, you already have one of those glove toys at home.
Timmy: [pointing at the glove toys] Not that one... [points to something off-screen] That one!
[Harold screams, and the Chum Bucket glove is then seen destroying property within Glove World, throwing a mini ferris wheel away. It stops in front of a mini merry-go-round filled with children.]
Kid Fish: Uh-oh.
[The Chum Bucket glove spins the mini merry-go-round, blasting the children away. The Glove World visitors scream and run away, and the glove flicks some of them off of his path.]
Hans: [from off-screen] Hey, Glove-zilla! [camera pans over to him, with SpongeBob and Plankton, and points at the Chum Bucket glove] Someone needs to teach you some Swedish manners! [clenches into a fist as a kid screams and runs away, then prepares to charge like a bull]
SpongeBob and Plankton: [points at the Chum Bucket glove off-screen] Sick 'em, Hans!
[Hans charges like a bull towards the Chum Bucket glove and pokes it, blasting SpongeBob and Plankton off onto a concessionaire stand. Afterwards, he picks out a mascot-wearing Glove World employee and flicks him away.]
Hans: I challenge you to a duel!
[Hans wrestles with the Chum Bucket glove. SpongeBob and Plankton are seen watching Hans wrestle the Chum Bucket glove.]
Plankton: Give him the old butt-kicking discount, Hans!
SpongeBob: But only love will defeat the glove!
[Hans continues to wrestle with the Chum Bucket glove. Hans pinches the Chum Bucket glove, while one of its fingers punch Hans away.]
SpongeBob: Oh, look, they're playing rock-paper-scissors! [Hans and the Chum Bucket glove play rock-paper-scissors while SpongeBob counts, off-screen] One, two, three! [Hans uses scissors]
Plankton: Yeah! Nothing beats scissors... [chuckles]
[The Chum Bucket glove uses rock and is hovering over Hans.]
SpongeBob: Oh, except rock...
[The Chum Bucket glove crushes Hans as SpongeBob and Plankton groan in pain. The Chum Bucket glove then proceeds to have a thumb war with Hans.]
SpongeBob: Oh my goodness, it's a thumb war!
[Hans continues to have a thumb war with the glove, which overpowers him and throws him onto a nearby ice cream stand, crushing it with their weight. They roll on the ground, towards SpongeBob and Plankton, who attempt to run away but end up being onboard Hans. The glove hurls them towards a bigger merry-go-round, and they all spin around as the glove continues its thumb war with Hans. They are all hurled off the merry-go-round, and the glove holds Hans down with its thumb. Hans is stuck under the glove's grasp.]
Hans: I can't defeat the glove, SpongeBob, it's too strong! You need to create a diversion.
SpongeBob: Diversion, eh?
[SpongeBob thinks of a diversion, and Plankton does the same, pacing back and forth.]
Plankton: Oh... Aha! [pauses] No...
[The scene alternates between SpongeBob and Plankton, who are both thinking. They suddenly get off of Hans.]
Plankton: We need a bullhorn, stat!
SpongeBob: [morphs nose into a bullhorn] I am a bullhorn, stat!
Plankton: [hops on SpongeBob and speaks into one of the holes; his voice amplified by bullhorn] Hey, Figure-face! Your grandma is a combat boot! [laughs]
[The Chum Bucket glove stops its thumb war with Hans and heads towards SpongeBob and Plankton, who both shiver in fear. The glove hovers over both of them and is about to attack, but Hans wears the glove.]
Hans: I got him! [poses] How do I look?
[The glove struggles to get off of Hans but is intercepted.]
SpongeBob: [admiringly] Aww, they fit each other just like a glove. [laughs]
Plankton: [imitates SpongeBob's laugh] Hardy-har-har.
Hans: He's harmless now, SpongeBob. See you tomorrow morning, I'll bring the pants! [leaves]
Plankton: [laughs, then realizes Hans left with his Chum Bucket glove] Wha–? Hey, come back! That glove is irreplaceable! Or is it?
[Scene cuts back into the Chum Bucket, whose glove is now replaced by a boot.]
Plankton: That looks way better than a glove! And it's a combat boot... to boot. [goes inside the Chum Bucket while singing to himself; then combat boot falls down] Ouch!
Jim the Wrestler: Yeah! [flexes his chest muscles]


[SpongeBob is carrying a big sack of snail food.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary.
Patrick: How is Gary?
SpongeBob: He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy.
Patrick: Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you...something important. Oh, I remember. Uh... [SpongeBob is gone] Who was I talking to?
SpongeBob: [puts the bag of snail food down and notices a piece of paper on the door] Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. "Dear Sir or Ma'am... [goes inside] We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience." [doorbell rings] Hello? [gasps] My package. Whoopee! [takes it inside while leaving the bag of snail food outside] Oh, let's see what we got here. [cuts it open] My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah! [grunts] What's this? "Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row." Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge. [takes the ball and hits it on the paddle, but it comes back and hits him in the eye] Darn it. [Tries again; results are the same] Darn it. [this happens again] Darn it.
Gary: [goes into the kitchen and sees that his food bowl is empty. He checks the time and it is snack time] Meow.
SpongeBob: [paddleball hits him in the eye again] Darn it.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What was that?
Gary: [louder] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me. [when he tries the paddleball again, Gary interrupts]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble. [when he lifts his paddleball up, Gary is attached to it]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion. [Dirty Bubble on the box laughs] Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it. [Gary slithers off] Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying. [Gary jumps on SpongeBob's face, making him run around and scream] Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get! [throws him away and grunts] And leave your master to his important affairs. [Gary rolls into his bowl and sees a crumb of food left. A bunch of spiders crawl out of it. Gary packs his things] Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers.
Gary: Meow. [Gary slithers off away, down a river, and takes a bus out of town. Cut to next day]
Patrick: [drinks his coffee, then eats the cup] I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him. [knocks on the door, then notices the bag of snail food on the ground] That's strange... Usually, I knock on the with this hand. [walks in] Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Oh, darn it. Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob? [opens the door to the galley to SpongeBob lying on the ground]
SpongeBob: Darn it. Darn it.
Patrick: SpongeBob, what happened? [runs over to a picture of a Krabby Patty on the wall] This picture is crooked. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [looks at the paddle] Darn it.
Patrick: Snap out of it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I...
Patrick: What is it, buddy? You can tell me.
SpongeBob: I took the Dirty Bubble challenge.
Patrick: You what?! [cries]
SpongeBob: Why are you crying, Patrick?
Patrick: Because... many years ago, I took that challenge.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: What happened?
Patrick: I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me.
SpongeBob: You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk—that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat. Fresh seahorse milk.
Patrick: Thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob: Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important? [trips over Gary's bowl] Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary. [gets the bag of snail food outside] That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours. [brings it in and pours it in Gary's bowl] Gary! Dinner! [takes out a triangle] Come on, Gary, soup's on. [rings it] Gary? Hey, Pat?
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?
Patrick: About a week.
SpongeBob: A week? Are you sure?
Patrick: Hmmm... well... [pours the glass of milk upside down. The milk is revealed to be solid, which falls like jelly. Sniffs the jelly. Starts eating the solid milk, analyzing the taste closely. Makes a sour face after tasting the overly sour taste.] Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.
SpongeBob: Ten days? Gary! [searches all over the house for Gary] Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick!
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: [his eyes fill up with tears as his lip quivers] I can't find Gary.
Gary: [is slithering across the sand. Echoing howls are heard. Gary looks at his stomach and it's howling at him. Gary sneezes] Meow.
SpongeBob: This never fails. Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.
Patrick: Eight?
SpongeBob: Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it. [Patrick shakes it, but it makes no noise] Let me see that. [SpongeBob tries it, but it still makes no noise] Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new... [Patrick belches. SpongeBob shakes his belly and Patrick laughs]
Patrick: I only tasted six types of sediment. [cut to nighttime where SpongeBob and Patrick are searching for Gary. Patrick is shaking his belly]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here? [lifts a flower up] Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh. [jiggles his belly]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself? [SpongeBob and Patrick open Squidward's door while he is in the bathtub] [screams three times and pants]
SpongeBob: You check over there. I'll check in here. [checks in the bathtub Squidward is in] Find him yet, Pat?
Patrick: [pulls the sink out from the wall, making water shoot out everywhere] No, but I'll keep looking.
SpongeBob: [teary-eyed] But there's nowhere left to look.
Patrick: There's one place we haven't checked. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in front of the former's mailbox full of letters]
SpongeBob: I doubt Gary could fit in there.
Patrick: Can't hurt to look.
SpongeBob: Here goes nothing. [opens the mailbox and a bunch of letters shoot out and a rolled up paper falls on the ground] Look, Pat!
Patrick: What is it?
SpongeBob: Let's see. "Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me." Dear Neptune, what have I done?
Patrick: What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there.
SpongeBob: Gary. [cut to Gary slithering into another town. A couple walks by him laughing, then sees Fred and Debbie Rechid eating inside a diner]
Fred: Are my pants too tight, dear? [takes a bite out of his burger, then notices Gary outside and closes the blinds on the window as they both laugh. Gary slithers along more until he stops and sees some nachos in an alleyway. When he is about to take a bite of it, three snails frighten him by hissing]
Snail #1: Look who came to dinner. [Gary runs away]
Snail #3: Guess he didn't like nachos. [Gary slithers away until he runs into a dark figure]
Gramma: There you are. [grabs Gary] There you are, Miss Tuffsy. Oh, gramma finally found you. She was starting to get worried. Now let's get to your home, Miss Tuffsy, and get you something to eat. Hmmm. [shakes Gary] You feel much lighter than Gramma remembers. [cut to Gramma's house where she is feeding Gary heart-shaped cookies and putting an electric blanket over him] There you go, Miss Tuffsy. Gramma knows you like your Mr. Heaty set to extra cozy when you're home relaxing.
Gary: Mmm.
Gramma: Goodness, you're almost out of cookies. Here, I'll go and get some more. Now, don't you go running off again. [Gary looks at a spoon collection and looks at a picture of snails] There you go. [puts some more cookies on] After this, I'll go make up some of those deviled eggs I promised. [drops empty cookie sheet] Oh, how about a little music? Gramma's got a killer stereo system. [music warbling faster as Gramma cranks the record player. Gary continues to eat cookies as jazz music begins to play] Oh, this song reminds Gramma of her days as a riveter. [dances] You make Gramma feel so young. Come on, Miss Tuffsy, let's do the boogie-woogie. [while doing the dance, she breaks her back] Oh. [set Gary back on the chair] Okay, oh, that's enough of the boogie-woogie for now.
SpongeBob: Gary! Gary? Gary! [looks into a hat store. On the reflection of the window, a truck with a picture of a snail drives by and stops. SpongeBob turns around] Gary! [truck's logo says "Hungry Snails Loves Snail-Po". Tires squeal as the dust gets into SpongeBob's face and makes him cough] Gary...! [crying] Oh... Gary! [fade out to Gramma and Gary sitting on the couch watching TV]
Gramma: Gramma knows how much you love these late-night crime drama programs. Don't you, Miss Tuffsy? Oh, heavens, look at the time. [clock reads 7:30] It's time for bed, Miss Tuffsy. [when Gary jumps off the couch, a picture of SpongeBob comes out of his bag]
Gary: [sadly] Meow.
Picture of SpongeBob: Quiet, Gary! Can't you see I'm busy? [Gary gives a raspberry. Gary goes into a bright and decorated room with Gramma]
Gramma: Here's your room, Miss Tuffsy.
Gary: [questioningly] Meow?
Gramma: Here you are, darling. Let Gramma tuck you in. There you go. Oh, [Gary's sad, precious round eyes sparkle up at Gramma] I almost forgot your good night kiss. [kisses Gary] Sweet dreams, Miss Tuffsy. [walks out of the room and claps twice to make the lights go out. Cut to next day at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is walking into the Krusty Krab on his knees. He has bloodshot eyes]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...
Mr. Krabs: [snaps fingers] Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on. [puts his hat on his head] Knew I'd figure it out.
SpongeBob: [his tears drop on the patty] Gary.
Evelyn: Yeah, I'd like a refund for this Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Refund?! What's wrong with it?
Evelyn: Oh, nothing, really... except that it's covered in tears! [reveals that there are six tears on the patty]
Mr. Krabs: What the...?
SpongeBob: Gary... [crying]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!
SpongeBob: This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.
SpongeBob: Well, you see...
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob's mouth] That's enough, boy. See, it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes, it's what you don't say. Understand?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy!
SpongeBob: If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it.
Mr. Krabs:  Wh...?
[cut to Patrick sleeping on the ground. A bunch of things fall on Patrick and wake him up]
Patrick: It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary.
Patrick: But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference.
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do. [cut to Gramma]
Gramma: [squeezing orange juice from the orange] There you go, Miss Tuffsy—fresh squeezed. It takes longer to make it that way, but it was a labor of love.
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: How about a little more syrup on those pancakes? [pours syrup on the pancakes. Then takes the spoon and scoops up a bite for Gary] Here comes the train. Hoo-hoo! [cut to Gramma and Gary in the car] Set phasers on fun, Miss Tuffsy. [engine revving, tires squeal as Gramma drives fast over to Martha's Craft Zone] Oh, here we are. [both walk inside. As soon as the door closes, SpongeBob and Patrick arrive in the front door with posters and tape]
SpongeBob: Here's a good spot. [puts a poster on the door] "Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob". Quick, hand me the tape.
Patrick: Hey, they're having a sale on scented pine cones.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is no time for that. [Patrick goes in. SpongeBob sighs]
Patrick: Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.
Gramma: These pipe cleaners are simply delightful.
Patrick: Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!
Gramma: Well, I hope you weren't looking to buy them, sonny, because Gramma already picked up all they had.
Patrick: Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary. [walks out as Gary stares at him]
SpongeBob: [finishes putting up the posters] There.
Patrick: When Patrick comes out, the posters on the door are torn in half] Um...uhh...
SpongeBob: Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out. [walk off]
Gramma: [walks out] Come on, Miss Tuffsy, there's plenty more fun to be had.
♪Gary, now I know I was wrong, I messed up, and now you're gone. Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you. Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me feeling this empty. Your meow right now would sound like music to me. Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary. Gary, come home. Gary, can't you see I was blind, I'll do anything to change your mind. More than a pet, you're my best friend, too cool to forget, come back 'cause we are family and forgive me for making you wanna roam. And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome. Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three-word poem: Gary, come home!♪
Patrick: I want peanuts. [presses button in the airplane]
SpongeBob: Pat, no! [airplane loses control. Both scream as the airplane rides through the message in the sky "GARY COME HOME" and changes it to "LISA, WILL YOU MARRY ME?"]
Mable: Who is this 'Lisa' person?
Lenny: What? [Mable slaps him. Cut to Gramma walking into her house]
Gramma: Gramma will get a lovely meat loaf in the oven for you.
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: Don't worry, it's no trouble at all. Easy to do. [Gary smells his newspaper pile]
Gary: Meow.
Gramma: Oh, Miss Tuffsy, do you have to go potty? Here, why don't you use this stack of fliers given to me today by a little chubby boy. [Gary reads all the fliers that SpongeBob and Patrick made. Gary imagines SpongeBob in a thought bubble]
SpongeBob: Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go! [Gramma whistles]
Gramma: You stay right there. The meatloaf is almost done. [Gary groans, then slithers over and opens a closet door to find a bunch of empty snail shells] Oh, dear. The meatloaf is not quite ready yet, but Gramma knows how hungry you are, Miss Tuffsy, so she whipped up a quick batch of cookies. [belt on Gary's belly snaps. A bunch of fat breaks through his shell. The snails in the painting on the wall talk]
Snails in picture: Run! [Gary strains to get out of the shell pile, but does and rolls toward Gramma's cookie plate and out the pet door. She tries to throw cookies at him, but they get stuck in the door]
Gramma: You don't want cookies? Don't fret, I made a batch of deviled eggs, too. [Gary looks behind him and Gramma is slowly walking behind him] Come back, Miss Tuffsy. You don't want these to go to waste, do you? They were a labor of love. [Gary hides behind some trashcans in the alleyway] Oh, don't worry, Miss Tuffsy, Gramma will find you.
Snail #3: Hey! You're the guy that doesn't like nachos.
Gramma: Miss Tuffsy, I know you're back there, I can't hear your stomach growling. [Gary pushes Snail #3 out into the sidewalk]
Snail #3: Hey!
Gramma: Oh, there you are, Miss Tuffsy.
Snail #3: Who?
Gramma: You must be starving. [Gary sighs deeply. Cut to SpongeBob trying to cry on his couch]
Patrick: Just let it out, buddy. That's right.
SpongeBob: I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him.
Patrick: Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood! [SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] They were awesome!
SpongeBob: Gary loved balsa wood! [runs off crying] I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind. [look at the giant sign of Gary] I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.
Gary: [climbs on SpongeBob's head] Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, like that. [Gary purrs] Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary! [He kisses Gary] So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving.
Gary: [groans] Meow.


[Episode starts and shows Squidward's house]
Squidward: [Slurps] Maybe I'll...practice my clarinet.
Squidward: Ah-he-he-hem. [Plays jazzy tune]
SpongeBob: Kind of sounds like Squidward's practicing his clarinet over there. Doesn't it, Gary? Gary? Well, I can't just stand by and let him practice alone. Then what kind of a friend and neighbor would I be? Not that kind that I... [metal tinges and takes out guitar]...would want.
[Squidward continues playing his clarinet until SpongeBob opens his window and he starts to play along. Squidward stops playing his clarinet after noticing SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hi, neighbor!
[SpongeBob and Squidward continue playing together until Squidward blows his clarinet out of his mouth]
Squidward: Gah! Dah! Dah! Dah!
SpongeBob: Should we take it from the top?

Mr. Krabs: Up and at 'em, boys! We got a tour to put on!
[Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff's bus]
Mrs. Puff: [Comes from under the bus] Phew...changing the oil in the school busmobile sure is a pain in the...[Hears the bus turn on]...What? [Oil sprays in her face and the bus drives off] Stop! Thief!
[The bus stops at the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs comes out of it and enters the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Mornin', Squidward! [Grabs a ladder and takes a speaker off of the wooden beam and throws it on the floor] Tour bus, sound equipment, check! All I need now is a...roadie? Now where in Neptune how I'm ever gonna find...
Patrick: [Enters holding a boat] Somebody left this thing laying around the parking lot.
Mr. Krabs: Roadie! Check!
[Bubble transition to the Ned and the Needlefish concert with Mr. Krabs driving to the outside of it]
Mr. Krabs: Here we are, boys! Our first gig! All those people are lined up to see you!
Squidward: Sounds like a load of hooey...
Mr. Krabs: Alright, roadie, start unloading the hooey! [Walks off the bus with Patrick]
Patrick: [Holding the speaker] Uh, Mr. Krabs? Where do I put this?
Mr. Krabs: [Writing on clipboard] Anywhere is fine.
Patrick: Then what about this? [Still holding the same speaker]
SpongeBob: Hey! Look! It's Ned and the Needlefish!
[Ned and the Needlefish walk off their bus with the crowd cheering for them and they enter the building]
Colonel Carper: Well, well, well! If it isn't that guy that stole my band! I hope you all aren't here to steal THIS band, too! Because THIS time around, I'll be ready for ya!
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's very interesting, Colonel Carper! But right now, my band and I are on a world tour! And tonight, we're opening for Ned and the Needlefish!
Colonel Carper: [Laughs heavily]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah...eh, what's so funny!?
Colonel Carper: You are! And the fact that you think you have any idea what it takes to put on a musical tour!
Mr. Krabs: We have a tour bus, sound equipment, a roadie!
Colonel Carper: You call that a tour bus? [Walks over to Patrick who is still holding the same speaker] You call this sound equipment? That's not a roadie, these are roadies! [Points over to two very large and muscular fish standing beside Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Ahhhh!
Colonel Carper: I'll tell you what, I'll let you open for Ned and the Needlefish on one condition: My roadies get to sabotage your sound equipment and have it blow up during your sound check!
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute...what's that gonna cost me?
Colonel Carper: Oh, that will be free!
Mr. Krabs: [Shakes Carper's fin] Deal!
[Bubble transition to a stage]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Mr. Squidward. Take it from the top! [Squidward plays a note but the speaker overhead instanly explodes] Doggonit...
Colonel Carper: Hah hah hah! Now you don't have any sound equipment! Unlike me, who has this entire wall of speakers you see right behind me! Hah hah hah! Now your whole tour is ruined! Hah hah hah hah! [Doesn't notice Mr. Krabs pushing away his wall of speakers behind him] Seriously! I can't! I can't take it! It's too much! [Falls on the ground laughing. Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' bus]
SpongeBob: It sure was nice of that Colonel Carper guy to let us borrow his entire wall of sound equipment! Wasn't it Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Well, here we are! Our next gig! [Stops at a Supermarket]
Squidward: We're performing at a supermarket? Driver, turn this bus around! The tour is canceled! Head straight back to the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, Squidward, but that is physically impossible!
Squidward: What!?
Mr. Krabs: Because it's not there anymore!
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab's not there anymore!? Where'd it go?
Mr. Krabs: I pawned it! To raise the cash for the concert tour!
SpongeBob: [Ears explode] You did what?!!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah...hard to believe, I know! My heard aches when I think of me old girl cold and lonely. Just sitting in the front window of that dirty pawn shop at the mercy of any random joe who just happens to pass on by.
[Scene changes to the Pawn Shop]
Plankton: [Whistling] Gasp! [Notices the Krusty Krab in the Pawn Shop's window] Hopping Hamburger Stands! I gotta go home and get my wallet!
[Scene changes back to the tour bus]
Squidward: It's not even my restaurant and somehow I regret that decision...
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Now quit your worrying back there! With the success we're about to have, we'll be able to buy ten Krusty Krabs!
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Squidward on stage]
Squidward: A one! And a two! And a one, two, three, four! [He and SpongeBob start playing together as the rest of the customers starts using food items to play along with the music as well including Patrick using chips together to make it sound right. He and SpongeBob stop playing and the customers go on with their shopping] Thank you! Thank you very much! [Notices the people walk away] Oh come on! Nothing!?
Mr. Krabs: What a happy celebration!
Dwight T. Wad: I most certainly agree!
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, Mr...[Reads the crab's nametag]...Supermarker Manager.
Dwight T. Wad: Here you go! [Gives Mr. Krabs a piece of paper]
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Our pay check?
Dwight T. Wad: Nope! It's a bill! [Walks off]
Mr. Krabs: What?
[Bubble transition to Shady Lanes retirement home]
Squidward: You're kidding me, right!? We're performing at a retirement home!?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry, Squidward! These geezers really know how to party!
Squidward: [Sarcastically] Oh, yeah...they got one foot in the rave. Heh heh...reaper jerks!
[Scene changes to a fish wheeling the Elderly Fish to a bunch of other older fish in front of SpongeBob and Squidward]
Squidward: Two, three, four! [Stops noticing another fish being wheeled up] Two, three, four! [Starts playing the music with SpongeBob until they are stopped by the Elderly Fish]
Elderly Fish: Too loud! You're playing too loud!
SpongeBob: [Quietly] Sorry, sir.
Squidward: [Quietly] Okay, two, three, four...[Starts playing quietly with SpongeBob, but is stopped yet again by the Elderly Fish]
Elderly Fish: Too loud! Still too loud! [Squidward plays one note] Still too loud! [Squidward and SpongeBob put their hands up] Too loud! [Squidward and SpongeBob put their instruments down] Too loud! [Squidward and SpongeBob walk off] Too...loud!
[Scene changes back to the tour bus]
Squidward: Supermarket openings, retirement homes! What's next a child's birthday party! [They arrive at a child's birthday party and they get off the bus] This is our worse gig yet: Children parties! Well, if this is the way this tour is being organized, then I would like to... Owww! [Notices a kid stuck in behind with a pin used for Pin the tail on the donkey] I am not a donkey-fish!
[Cue commercial. Comes back from commercial with it opening with Mr. Krabs' tour bus. SpongeBob and Patrick are resting on Squidward]
Squidward: [Knocks SpongeBob and Patrick off] Mr. Krabs, how much farther is it to the next town?
Mr. Krabs: [Reading a map] Uh...not too much farther, Squidward! Uh...oh, in fact, we're just entering it now! [Turns on a sign that literally says "Next Town"]
Squidward: Well, if this concert is anywhere near terrible as the other ones, then it's gonna be my last! [Notices Mr. Krabs parking at run down place called Electronics Outhouse] What the...Electronics Outhouse!? Goodbye! [Tires to leave off bus but Mr. Krabs quickly closes it on his face]
Mr. Krabs: This ain't our next concert!
Squidward: Well, then, where is it!?
Mr. Krabs: It's uh...uh...um...[He, Squidward, and SpongeBob notice a crowd heading toward a stadium] Well, it's right over there obviously! [Drives to the stadium that says "Ned and the Needlefish Today" on it and they get off the bus] I'll just leave the three of you right here to set up! I got some important tour management business to attend to, you know!
Squidward: Hold it! This better not be one of your tricks, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs closes the door on Squidward and drives back to the "Next Town" sign and hammers something to it then drives off. Ned and the Needlefish then drives up to the sign]
Band Member 1: Hey, look, man! [Notices the sign that now shows their name] "Ned and the Needlefish, Next Turn."
Ned: Whoa...it's like a sign from....sign, man. [Stops driving at the Electronics Outhouse] Wow...we have really moved down in the world.
[Scene changes back to the stadium where SpongeBob and Squidward are at]
SpongeBob: Isn't this the most exciting experience in your entire life, Squidward?
Squidward: Yeah. I've never thought I get to perform for so many fans!
SpongeBob: Oh? Are there people showing up?
Squidward: Isn't that... what you we’re talking about? [The stage opens up and he smiles and he hears the crowd cheering] Ah, just soak on in, Squiddy, old boy! Pretty invigorating, isn't it? Wait a minute... why are they chanting "Ned and the Needlefish?"
SpongeBob: No, can't you hear them, Squidward? They're saying “Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward...” [Notices the lights turn on and the crowd stop chanting]
Harold: That does not look like Ned and the Needlefish! [He along with the crowd start booing]
Squidward: Wait! I know what you came here for! [Starts to play on his clarinet with SpongeBob playing along with his guitar] Well?
Harold: Chase 'em off stage!
Squidward: Uh oh...[Runs away along with SpongeBob as the crowd is chasing them down. Scene changes back to the Electronics Outhouse]
Ned: Yeah!
Man: Excuse me? Could on of you show me how to use this multimeter?
Ned: Uh...he probably can...[Points to one of his band members]
Man: Thanks. [Shows his multimeter to the band member.]
[Bubble transition to Colonel Carper]
Colonel Carper: [Furious] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [Puts on a fake mustache] Do I know you?
Colonel Carper: [Blows off Mr. Krabs' mustache] Colonel Carper!
Mr. Krabs: Were we in the Navy together?
Colonel Carper: No, we were not!
Mr. Krabs: Phew, that's good! 'Cause for a second there, I thought that we maybe...
Colonel Carper: ...Your shenanigans, sir are at an end! Oh yes! And you will be receiving a friendly little phone call from my attorney! Because I am suing you for every last dime!
[Bubble transition to Carper's roadies taking back his sound equipment]
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute! Where'd you think you're going with your own equipment!?
Patrick: Hey, thanks again, fellas! Nice guys like them don't come around much these days. They even redecorated the tour busmobile for us! [Mr. Krabs notices the bus now says "LOSERS" on it]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
'Mr. Krabs: How'd the show go, boy?
SpongeBob: Oh, the crowd went wild, sir!
Squidward: In fact, they're still going wild... [Notices the crowd still chasing them]
Mr. Krabs: Quick! On the bus! [He along with Squidward and SpongeBob run onto the bus and drives off]
Squidward: Well, that wasn't a complete waste of time... Oh no wait, it was.
Mr. Krabs: [Starts to cry] Now I'll never get me ol' Krusty Krab out of pawn! [Crying]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
[They start swerving on the road with SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick screaming and they eventually drive off a cliff and lands on the ground with the bus tumbling many times. They all get off the bus]
Mr. Krabs: Good news, boys! We only sustained a flat tire! Patrick, go get the spare lad!
Patrick: Uh...oh! Yeah, I can't.
Squidward: What do you mean you can't?
Patrick: Well...
Squidward: No no! Wait! Let me guess: You ate the spare tire?
Patrick: Wow...you're good at guessing...
SpongeBob: Patrick, why didn't you just ask me? [Takes out a small plastic bag with very small tires in it] You know I always bring tiny, snack size tires for in-between meals! You know, I'm kinda hungry now actually. [Eats one of the tires] Hmm...Squidward? They're fat free!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I'd like some money for cab fair.
Mr. Krabs: But, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: But nothing. I'm going home. Now put some cash in my hands so I...
Mr. Krabs: [cries and hugs Squidward] But I don't have any money, lad! Not even a nickel! It's all gone! Me Krusty Krab is gone!
Squidward: [Pushes away Mr. Krabs] Forget it! I'll just walk! [Starts to walk off]
SpongeBob: Wait! Squidward! Squidward! You can't go! Please! Don't you see? The Krusty Krab needs us more than ever!
Squidward: I could care less what the Krusty Krab needs! [Moves SpongeBob away] Now get out of my way! [Walks into a cactus] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow...
SpongeBob: Squidward! Are you okay?
Squidward: Get your hands off me! [Walks into another cactus and bumps into a third one] Ow! [Brushes himself off]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: Don't...[Walks off into the sunset]
SpongeBob: [Climbs on top of the bus and takes out his guitar and starts playing it]♪ Squidward...you must look inward. And then I'm sure that you will see what an awesome band we still could be! Please! Oh please don't quit on us now! I cannot allow this to be our last bow! Now now now! No no no! Nay nay nay! Neh neh neh! NEEEEVER give up! Don't ever give up! We can't let Mr. Krabs go bankrupt! We must keep busy! Never giving up! ♪
Squidward: ♪ How did I not see this plan was a failure from the start? Being around SpongeBob is bad for my heart! And that's not even the worse part! Supermarkets, retirement homes, birthday parties for kids! My career in music really feels like it has hit the skids! I give up! There is no point! I give up! Mr. Krabs will have to go bankrupt while I'm busy, bittering giving up! ♪

Squidward: Wow! That was actually, kinda good! [Notices the crowd cheering for them]
Harold: Amazing!
Male Fish: Fantastic!
Mr. Krabs: Unbelievable! They actually gathered a crowd! To think that all of these people came out to the middle of the desert to see Squidward and SpongeBob!
Patrick: Or...they came to see the meteor shower that passes through the Aurora Borealis generating a stunning, once-in-a-lifetime light show.
Crowd: [Looking at the beautiful sky] Oh....ah....
Mr. Krabs: [Sets up a stand] Thank you! Come again, please! [Puts money in the register, then in the bag] He he he!
SpongeBob: Look! It's Mr. Krabs! Squidward and I just performed for an crowd of adoring fans!
Mr. Krabs: That's nice! I just made more money than I know what to do with!
Squidward: Well, it looks like they could help you figure it out...
Mr. Krabs: Who? [Notices a very long line then reads a sign] Get Paid Back from Mr. Krabs Line starts here...[Gets sad]
Narrator: One long angry line later...
Colonel Carper: Well, well, well! It looks like this is the end of the line for you! Both literally and figuratively! Hah! Hah! Hah!
Mr. Krabs: Why'd I owe you money for!?
Colonel Carper: Well, let's see: How about damaged sound equipment, loss revenue, and JUST BECAUSE!
Mr. Krabs: I don't owe you a nickel!
Colonel Carper: No! You owe me a million nickels! Roadies! It's collecting time!
Mr. Krabs: Collecting time? [Gets grabbed by the roadies and they start shaking the money from him]
Colonel Carper: [laughs] Yeah! AH HA! Okay boys! Our work here is done! [The roadies drop Mr. Krabs into the ground]
[Bubble transition to the Pawn Shop]
Mr. Krabs: [Sobbing] Well, Krusty Krab, this is goodbye...[Kisses the glass and cries mores] Why!? Why!?
SpongeBob: Don't cry, Mr. Krabs. Here! [Takes out a piggy bank] You can have the money for Gary's college fund if that would...[Mr. Krabs quickly takes the money and runs into the Pawn Shop] help.
Mr. Krabs: [Grabs the Krusty Krab and puts it on his boat] Well, SpongeBob! You ready to get back to doing what we do best?
SpongeBob: [Puts on hat] I'm ready!
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy! [Drives off]
Plankton: [Wheels in a lot of money] Hello, sir! I'd like to purchase the Krusty Krab restaurant you have in your...where is it?
Pawn Shop Owner: Oh, sorry, sir! I just sold it a minute ago. But we do have this slightly used Taco Stand for sale.
[Plankton has a shocked look on his face and the episode ends]


[Following the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song, the brief opening titles show the names of creator Stephen Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, and others. The episode opens with a bubble transition, and we see a coral reef under the sea. The camera zooms to initiate parallax scrolling, which reveals the city of Bikini Bottom. It continues zooming to show a brown rock, a Moai head, and a pineapple, which each contain inhabitants.]
French Narrator: Ah, the sea... so fascinating. So wonderful. Here, we see Bikini Bottom, teeming with life. [Shows from left to right Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses. Zooms in on SpongeBob's house.] Home to one of my favorite creatures, SpongeBob SquarePants. Yes, of course he lives in a pineapple, you silly. [Scene cuts to the house's bedroom. A sea snail is seen sleeping near a pile of newspapers on the floor, a scallop is seen in a birdcage, and a young, optimistic sea sponge is seen sleeping in his bed, snoring as his foghorn alarm clock ticks. SpongeBob's alarm then sounds. He wakes, but is unaffected by the annoying sound, and with a smile on his face, turns it off. He climbs from his bed to a ladder, leading to his diving board.]
SpongeBob SquarePants: Today's the big day, Gary!
Gary the Snail: Meow.
SpongeBob: [jumps on the diving board] Look at me, I'm... [jumps up, and leaves his underwear behind] ...naked! [Lands inside pants, walks over to exercise room. His head pops out of the top of his pants.] Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [He goes inside his small gym room that has a sign that reads "l Love Pain." Taking deep breaths, he prepares to lift a barbell that is balanced by two lightweight stuffed animals. He sticks out his chest, but almost passes out because he can barely lift it. He drops it, and it makes a "squeak" noise] I'm ready!!! [runs outside] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! [A dimwitted sea star's rock tilts upwards with him stuck to its underside.]
Patrick Star: Go, SpongeBob! [Patrick falls] Whoa! [crash sound effect]
 SpongeBob (1997 Version): I'm ready! I'm ready! [SpongeBob jumps in the air as the scene freezes and a title reads SpongeBob SquarePants]
 Narrator (1997 Version)&#160;: SpongeBob SquarePants! [It shows SpongeBob running through various landscapes, as it shows a frozen scene of SpongeBob standing in front of the Krusty Krab the scene unfreezes and then the episode continues as normal]
SpongeBob: [runs down the street to the Krusty Krab] There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating: The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty... with a Help Wanted sign in the window. For years I've been dreaming of this moment. I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'im straight in the eye [breaks the fourth wall and looks the audience in the eye], lay it on the line and... I can't do this! [He starts to run home, but Patrick stops him.] Hey, Patrick-
Patrick: Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob: I was just...
Patrick: No, you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get! That! Job!
SpongeBob: I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Whose first words were "May I take your order?"?
SpongeBob: Mine were.
Patrick: Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
SpongeBob: I did.
Patrick: [grimaces and contorts twice while trying to come up with a good third line] Who's a, uh, who's uhh, oh! And who's the big yellow cube with holes?
SpongeBob: I am!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?!
SpongeBob: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. An octopus is seen cleaning graffiti on the restaurant's windows.]
Squidward Tentacles: [cleaning graffiti of himself with the word "loser," sees SpongeBob, and sighs] Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
SpongeBob: [in background, at first while Squidward was talking] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, self! [Squidward looks at the Help Wanted sign, screams, and runs inside.]
Squidward: [While SpongeBob says, "I'm ready," one more time in the background] Mr. Krabs! [cuts to the ordering window, where a greedy crab is seen happily sniffing a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him.] Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you- [interrupted by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard, captain. [deep voice] I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew [normal voice] and now I'm ready. [SpongeBob trips on a nail stuck in the floorboard. Mr. Krabs and Squidward look at each other. His fall causes him to bounce against the ceiling. SpongeBob shouts and blurts incomprehensibly while his bounces and ricochets around the building accelerate. He then rolls to a stop at the feet of Squidward and Mr. Krabs.] So, uh, when do I start?
Eugene H. Krabs: Well, lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward quickly walk away from SpongeBob]
Squidward: [deep breath] No. [Mr. Krabs winks. They head back to SpongeBob, who looks completely puzzled at what he's hearing]
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad, we'll give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew. Go out and fetch me... [SpongeBob takes out a notepad] a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula... [SpongeBob quickly jots down what he says] with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments, [more scribbling] and, uh... turbo drive. [more scribbling] And don't come back ‘til you get one. [Mr. Krabs puts a Krusty Krab crew hat on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob sees how he looks in a mirror, there are sparkles on his hat, and he has a huge, satisfied smile]
SpongeBob: [saluting Krabs] Aye aye, captain! [reading] One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, Sir!
Mr. Krabs: Carry on! [SpongeBob leaves] We'll never see that lubber again.
Squidward: You're terrible. A hydro-what? [Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh. While Squidward laughs, his nose moves distinctly while he inhales and exhales. Krabs laugh sounds like a pirate. As they laugh, SpongeBob is shown leaving the Krusty Krab. As SpongeBob fades out of sight, five buses drive toward the Krusty Krab from the opposite direction.]
Bus driver: Hey! Hey! Please! Passengers are to stay seated and not put their fins out the window! [The buses surround the Krusty Krab and the doors open; Mr. Krabs stops laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] That sounded like hatch doors! [sniffs repeatedly] Do you smell it? That smell... A kind of smelly smell... A smelly smell that smells... smelly... [his eyes widen] Anchovies.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: Anchovies!! [Anchovies get out of the buses and rush inside the Krusty Krab, crowding, repeating the word "meep" over and over again]
Squidward: Please, please, quiet! [Anchovies stop talking] Is this any way to behave, hmmm?
Anchovy: Meep.
Squidward: Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register? [The anchovies stare for a moment, then pick up the boat, as their cries of "meep!" become more intense. Cut to Barg'N-Mart as SpongeBob enters.]
SpongeBob: [singing to himself] ♪ Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs. ♪  [cuts back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are still in the boat register, and being tossed around like a ship in a storm.]
Mr. Krabs: All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
Squidward: One single file line was all I asked!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! [Mr. Krabs and Squidward are thrown up in the air]  Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again; the boat is in splinters] We're taking on water, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again, with Krabs clutching Squidward] I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! [cuts to Barg'N-Mart]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments. ♪ [cuts back to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Help!
Mr. Krabs: Man overboard! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! [They climb the mast, while the anchovies try to get them down. The anchovies then form a big wave.]
Anchovies: Meep! Meep!
Mr. Krabs: This is the end! Goodbye, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! [They cry, then SpongeBob comes in with red lights flashing and flying with the spatula, singing a heroic tune]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stuttering in shock at SpongeBob getting the hydrodynamic spatula]
SpongeBob: That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with [two spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one] port-and-starboard attachments! And let's not forget the turbo drive! [the two extending spatulas twirl around and smack Squidward and Mr. Krabs in the face] Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! [to the anchovies] Who's hungry?! [Tiny Tim's "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" plays while SpongeBob serves up Krabby Patty after Krabby Patty. Numerous Krabby Patties are launched through the opening window to the hungry anchovies. Eventually, all of the anchovies are served and they leave on the buses. SpongeBob blows the spatula. Cuts to later.]
Mr. Krabs: That was the finest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants. Welcome aboard. [Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob a name tag]
Squidward: B-but, but, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
Squidward: [weakly] Hooray, Mr.-
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip!
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray. Mr. Krabs-
Mr. Krabs: I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty. [He wheels a wheelbarrow piled with an enormous stack of cash to his office. Patrick enters]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Squidward: What would you like to order, Patrick?
Patrick: One Krabby Patty, please. [The instrumental to "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" starts playing. SpongeBob flies back to the kitchen, using his spatula, and a score of Krabby Patties is immediately fired through the servery, which collide with Patrick and send him flying out of the Krusty Krab. Cuts to Krusty Krab exterior; crashing noises.]
Patrick: [screams]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [singsong] Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee...!


[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where a large crowd of people is gathered to watch SpongeBob perform his latest stunt: To become the first sponge to high dive up to the surface.]
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here for Bikini Bottom News. Today, SpongeBob SquarePants will attempt the impossible: a high-sea dive from that diving board! [points to the diving board on the side of SpongeBob's house] He'll be the first sponge ever to dive up through the ocean.
[Inside the house, Gary is spreading lard all over SpongeBob's body.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Did you hear what Perch said, Gary? The first sponge!
[SpongeBob imagines a statue of himself being built in his honor. Monroe Timmy walks up and stares in awe at the statue.]
Monroe Timmy: Whoa.
SpongeBob Statue: [comes to life] Pretty cool, huh, kid? [winks]
[Monroe Timmy screams and runs away. The daydream ends. SpongeBob sucks the little buoy in his lard-covered body.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, that's enough lard. I gotta warm up.
[SpongeBob slides over to the barbells. He goes to lift it up, but his arms keep slipping off. He ties his arms on the barbell and proceeds to lift it up. The weight of the barbell causes SpongeBob to fall over and it falls off his arms. The barbell is sent flying and crashing through the wall.]
SpongeBob: That's good. I'm all warmed up.
[Mr. Krabs is outside selling SpongeBob-themed products.]
Mr. Krabs: Get your SpongeBob standees here! Buy one and take home a hero! [holds a standee up for Nat Peterson] Here you are, [hits Nat with the standee] here! [hits him again] Here!
Patrick: [walks up and sees a standee of SpongeBob, which he stupidly mistakes for SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob. What's new? [silence; Patrick gets mad] Oh, so that's how it is, huh? The silent treatment. Well, two can play at that game, mister! [huffs and pouts]
Bubble Bass: [Walks up]Excuse me. How much for this stupid starfish standee?
Mr. Krabs: [appears and sees Patrick]Hmm? Hmm. [giggles and makes a greedy face, seeing a perfect chance at more profit] 20 bucks?
Bubble Bass: [grunts as he pulls Patrick's left arm off] But it's damaged.
Mr. Krabs: 10 bucks? [giggles]
Bubble Bass: [holds up money] Sold!
[Bubble Bass gives Mr. Krabs the money. Mr. Krabs' eyelids eats the money and he burps out a receipt from his mouth. The crowd continues to chatter as they wait for SpongeBob to perform his stunt.]
SpongeBob: [pops out from the window] Hi-uh! [sticks himself on the diving board, but he's upside down; he pulls out his little buoy from his head]
Perch Perkins: And here's our hero now with the flag he will plant on the surface.
[The crowd cheers.]
SpongeBob: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [goes to the end of the diving board as drumroll is being played; he attempts to perform his stunt, but since he was upside-down, he falls to the ground] Ahh! Ooh.
[The crowd groans and leaves in disappointment.]
Mr. Krabs: Get your SpongeBob standees right here. Buy one and take home a loser. [chortles]
SpongeBob: [gets up] I just don't understand it. Surface divers go down. Why didn't I go up?
Sandy: Well, back in Texas, Olympic divers have gravity to help them go down. What you need is anti-gravity to go up.
SpongeBob: Anti-gravity? Yes! [pops lightbulbs out from his body] Yah! [sucks the lightbulbs in his body and giggles]
[SpongeBob runs back in his house. Then he comes back out on the diving board with balloons tied around his waist.]
Squidward: [picks up trash around his house] Hmph. Stupid messy moron rubbernecking flounders and so on...
[SpongeBob goes to perform his stunt and successfully dives off the diving board. The balloons help him float in the air while Squidward continues grumbling as he picks up the trash.]
SpongeBob: I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
[SpongeBob floats into a swarm of jellyfish. Jellyfish fly around him as he continues floating to the surface. They make a stairway for him and SpongeBob climbs higher and higher.]
SpongeBob: I'm the first high-sea-diving sponge. [pulls out the little buoy from his nose]
[But just when he was about to reach the surface, a pile of garbage blocks everything. The balloons pop and SpongeBob holds onto a rope.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what happened to the surface?
[The screen zooms up to Bikini Atol where the garbage reveals itself as the Great Pacific garbage patch, floating on the surface and eventually causing water pollution.]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Huh? [attaches himself to the garbage with the suction cups] Aw, gee, and I was so close. [kicks a bolt and it falls upward] Hmm? What is this place? [puts his little buoy in his head]
[SpongeBob searches around the trash. He climbs on an old television and slides down.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
[SpongeBob climbs on an old telephone receiver and it falls upward. He puts on a bowtie.]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
[SpongeBob strums on the giant comb like a harp. He giggles and the comb falls upward. SpongeBob climbs on another pile of trash.]
SpongeBob: This place is trash-tastic! [pounds on his chest and does a Tarzan-like yell; suddenly, someone throws a large key in SpongeBob's face.] Ow! [dodges an incoming pen] Oh, hey now! Whoa-whoa-whoa-oh-oh! [bumps into a giant car pump and it falls upward]
[Meanwhile, down on the ground, several townspeople began seeing stuff descending down from the Great Pacific garbage patch from above.]
Dave: What's that?
[The giant comb floats down.]
Evelyn: I don't know.
[The comb lands in front of a farmer.]
Farmer: Hmm. [grunts as he picks up the comb]
[The farmer places the comb on the back of the tractor. He climbs in the tractor and drives it. The comb is being used as a chisel plow and plants begin to sprout.]
Thaddeus: It's a gift!
Evelyn: From the sky?
Dave: From Neptune!
[A group of boy scout campers are setting up a tent.]
Boy Scout Campers: Yay! [the tent falls apart] Aww.
[A pen floats down to them.]
Boy Scout Campers: [gasps and fixes the tent with a pen] Thank you, Neptune!
[A recently married couple enter through a gate and are about to live in their dream home. But unfortunately, there was no home for them to live in.]
Groom: [sheepishly] I'm sorry, honey. I couldn't afford the whole house. Just the door!
[Just then, the giant car pump falls in place where the door is and makes a new house.]
Groom: [happy] Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Look at that!
Bride: Now there's room for my mother!
Groom: Whaa?!
[The bride waves as, the screen pans out and reveals really her tall mother with her packages.]
Bride's Mother: Ehh...
[Meanwhile, back up in the Great Pacific garbage patch, SpongeBob is still wandering around.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? I thought I saw something over—[gets hit by a giant plastic spoon] Ow! [sees a shadowy figure] Hello? Who are you?
[The mysterious figure comes out and reveals himself to be none other than Old Man Jenkins.]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm King Neptune! Feel my power! [throws a paperclip at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow! Old Man Jenkins? [pulls the paperclip off his face]
Old Man Jenkins: I'm not Old Man Jenkins anymore! I'm King Neptune! Take that! [throws a bottle cap at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [whimpers as he dodges the bottle cap] Huh? All right, I'll play along. Hey, King Neptune! I'm Poseidon! [laughs and throws a giant sandal at Old Man Jenkins]
Old Man Jenkins: [dodges sandal] Oh!
[Old Man Jenkins grabs a giant eraser and throws it at SpongeBob. The two of them get into a trash fight and the thrown trash are being floated down to Bikini Bottom from above. A butter knife floats down to a local business man.]
Business Man: Hmm? Neptune is blessing us with gifts and treasures! [changes into his bathing suit] Surf's up, dude!
[Gale and Nat are driving in a boat. Suddenly, a giant vacuum cleaner crashes down onto their boat. They both giggle and hop onto the vacuum. They drive the vacuum all over Bikini Bottom.]
Nat Peterson: Oh, yeah! All right! Ho-ho!
[A group of people gather around and a little girl is holding a bunch of balloons.]
Little Girl #1: You say your desire into the balloon, blow it up, and send it to Neptune. [whispers] A slice of pizza. [blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface]
Cara: [stretches balloon and speaks into it] A never-ending roll of toilet paper. [blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface]
Little Girl #2: [stretches balloon and speaks into it] A million grandmas. [blows a balloon and lets it float to the surface]
[Sooner or later, many balloons are floating upward to the surface. Meanwhile, back up in the Great Pacific garbage patch, SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins grow tired from their garbage fight. Old Man Jenkins walks up to SpongeBob and looks at him closely.]
Old Man Jenkins: You're not Poseidon. You're SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: [holds up a mirror] And you're Old Man Jenkins!
Old Man Jenkins: I was Old Man Jenkins 'til I came here. It was a year ago today...
[A flashback is shown with Old Man Jenkins celebrating his birthday with some elderly friends at Shady Shoals Rest Home.]
Senior Citizens: ♪Happy birthday to you♪
[One of Old Man Jenkins' friends gives him a bunch of balloons.]
Old Man Jenkins: Oh, thank you, dea— [begins to float away with the balloons] Hello? Some help, please?
Senior Citizens: [grumble and head back into the rest home] So now I gotta go back? I came all the way over here.
Old Man Jenkins: Hey—hey, come back here! Come back, now!
[The flashback ends. Just then, a yellow balloon appears and pops next to SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins, surprising them.]
Voice #1: Neptune, I want a mustache.
[Another balloon appears and pops.]
Voice #2: Neptune, I want a cool voice.
[Another balloon appears. SpongeBob catches the balloon and pops.]
Patrick: [voiceover] Neptune, I want another balloon.
[Another balloon appears and pops.]
Patrick: [voiceover] Now!
Old Man Jenkins: My subjects! I must get down to help them.
SpongeBob: Well, we could build a ladder out of this stuff and climb down—ooh, uh, down?
Old Man Jenkins: What are you, senile?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. I'm juvenile! [laughs]
[SpongeBob begins to grab several trash and stacks them up one by one in order to make a ladder to climb back down. Meanwhile, back down on the ground, the townsfolk are starting to get worried.]
Citizen #1: Hey, what happened?
Citizen #2: What's going on here?
Harold: Why isn't Neptune sending us more gifts down for us?
Gale Rechid: We must have upset him.
Harold: You must have upset him! [the townsfolk strap Gale to a death table and is prepared to be killed] This is for you, Neptune! Oohh— [prepares to kill her until...]
Gale Rechid: Wait! Look!
[SpongeBob's ladder made out of the garbage descends downward. The crowd gasps and murmurs in amazement.]
Citizen #3: Oh, it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
Citizen #4: What is it?
Gale Rechid: What do you think it is?
Harold: It's a ladder from Neptune! Let's climb up and get more free stuff!
Gale Rechid: Me first! [buffs up her muscles and breaks free]
[Gale runs up to the trash ladder and begins to climb it. Then several other townsfolk join in and follow her up the trash ladder. SpongeBob grabs an old soup can and finishes the ladder. The surface is now sparkly clean from the garbage patch.]
SpongeBob: Phew! It took every piece of the island to make this ladder. Ooh? Hey! Look at that! [pulls the little buoy out of his head and sticks it to the surface] I'm the first sponge to ever do that!
Old Man Jenkins: Big whoop.
SpongeBob: Oh, yes! It's the biggest whoop! Let's go home!
[SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins begin to climb down to the ocean floor. Suddenly, the ladder starts shaking.]
Old Man Jenkins: Stop shaking the ladder!
SpongeBob: I'm not shaking it!
[Down below the ladder, the townsfolk continue to climb up until they see SpongeBob and Old Man Jenkins above.]
Gale Rechid: I think I see him! It's Neptune!
Fred: Oh, Neptune!
Citizens: Neptune! Out of my way!
[The townsfolk climb upward but suddenly stop.]
Gale Rechid: Wait a minute. [sees Old Man Jenkins climbing down] It's Old Man Jenkins!
Nat Peterson: Old Man Jenkins is Neptune?
Dale: All hail Old Man Jenkins!
Old Man Jenkins: Get off my trash, you idiots!
Dale: Praise Neptune! We're all idiots for you!
Citizens: We're all idiots! We're all idiots!
[The townsfolk's cheering causes the ladder to shake, knocking over SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Ooh-whaa! [clings onto another box]
Gale Rechid: Hey, it's SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Everybody climb back down! There's nothing up there! [climbs down to the townsfolk] I dove up and found Old Man Jenkins living among all these objects.
Gale Rechid: Then it was you that sent these treasures down!
Nat Peterson: Hooray for SpongeBob! He's our hero!
[The townsfolk cheer. But their cheering shakes the ladder even more.]
SpongeBob: No! Ahh! Ohh—ow!
[The ladder crumbles and all of the trash as well as SpongeBob, Old Man Jenkins, and the townsfolk are sent crashing down to Bikini Bottom. The city is now a complete mess with trash.]
Old Man Jenkins: [pops out from the trash, grabs a bottle cap and a fork, and stands on Nat Peterson's head] I'm King Neptune! King of the seven seas, the lakes, rivers, puddles...[spits saliva into a spittoon] And spit too! I'm the king of spit!
King Neptune: So you're the king of spit?
[Thunder roars]
Old Man Jenkins: [Nervously]Uh-oh.
[Out from the clouds, the real King Neptune appears on his chariot and he's not very happy.]
King Neptune: "Uh-oh" is right.
[Old Man Jenkins stands scared as Nat Peterson, upon seeing the real King Neptune, whimpers in fear. He grabs a suitcase and runs away. King Neptune ignites his trident and zaps Old Man Jenkins, burning him to a crisp.]
Old Man Jenkins: I smell like toast. Am I breakfast? [bites off his hand] Needs jelly.
[Mr. Krabs comes by and notices the pile of trash. He also notices SpongeBob's hands sticking out from underneath.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? [pulls out a mortally wounded SpongeBob] Ooh, well, look at that. Someone threw away a good SpongeBob standee. [laughs and throws SpongeBob in his truck-load of SpongeBob-standees] Yagh! [closes the trunk] Oof! [climbs in the truck] Ugh.
[Mr. Krabs drives away with his truck, carrying SpongeBob and the standees inside.]
SpongeBob: They called me a hero.


SpongeBob: [holding a pan over the stove] Come on, stovie, pop that corn! [popcorn bag grows enormously huge] Get ready, Gary. [trips over Gary landing in the chair] Incoming! [popcorn bag explodes everywhere]
Gary: Meow. [popcorn ricochets everywhere and piles up to SpongeBob's waist]
SpongeBob: Popcorn is served! [eats a piece of popcorn while music plays on TV]
Medley: That, bro, is trouble at any car wash.
TV Announcer: We will return to "Bikini Bottom Car Wash" after these messages.
Commercial Announcer: Are you boring?
Charlie: Yes, yes I am.
Commercial Announcer: When friends describe you, do they use words like... [words appear as they are being said] "dull!" or "drab!?"
Charlie: [laughs] Don't forget "platitudinous". [word appears over his head. A mystical head floats beside Charlie]
Commercial Announcer: Yes, that too, Charlie. But what if I told you that you can change all that with the magic of... magic! [turns Charlie into a magician]
Charlie: [laughs] I look like some kind of magician. Now people won't ignore me.
Commercial Announcer: Let's hope not, Charlie. With my "Mister Magic Magical Magic Kit", even you can impress and amaze your friends.
SpongeBob: [holds on to the TV] I want to impress and amaze my friends!
Commercial Announcer: Just send $19.95 to me, Mister Magic. [SpongeBob puts an envelope into the mail slot, then takes the post office mail can and stuffs it in 'Outgoing Mail']
Narrator: 4 to 6 weeks later...
Mailman: One magic kit and another one of these yellow things. [stuffs both into SpongeBob's mailbox then drives off]
SpongeBob: [gets out of his mailbox and rips the packaging off the box that came in the mail] Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit. [opens the box and gasps] Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic. [notices Squidward to the side slurping a drink] Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill.
Squidward: Brine soda, low-fast seaweed crisps, cool jazz. [eats a seaweed crisp] Mm, mm, Squidward you have done it. You have officially spoiled yourself rotten.
SpongeBob: Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic!
Squidward: Magic? Can you make yourself disappear, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard. [Squidward's eye twitches] No, I better start with something simpler. [gets out a deck of cards] Say card conjuring. [Squidward is now depressed more than ever] Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see... [reads his book of spells] step 1...
Squidward: [sighs] This can't possibly end soon.
SpongeBob: Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist, Mister Magic. [juggles the three balls in and out of his holes on his body]
Squidward: [steps onto the bus that just pulled up] I don't care where I'm going, just take me away from here. [bus drives off]
SpongeBob: Then take one card and shove it in your ear. [does so. A car drives by with Tom in the driver's seat and his son Monroe in the passenger seat bawling]
Monroe: But I don't like pistachio!
Tom: Then why did you ask for it? [drives into a bump, which causes the ice cream to fly out the car and into Squidward's lawn chair. Monroe starts crying loudly]
[The pistachio ice cream cone lands in Squidward's sunbathing chair]
SpongeBob: And finally, say the words "Hobris-Pobris." [gasps] Squidward! My simple card-trick has turned you into an ice cream cone. Which means... I am a level ten wizard! I suppose I should change you back to squid form. [looks at his book of spells] Presto! [nothing happens] Uh, let's see. Umm... A-ha! Alakazam! [gasps] Abracadabra. [gasps] Okilee-dokilee. Hobra-cobra. Oh! Open sesame. Change-o back-o to Squidward-o, please-o? Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward. [sniffs, tears up] I've transformed you into a delicious dairy dessert and I can't change you back! There, there, Squidward. There is no need to cry. I promise you will continue your normal life despite the fact that you are now edible. [cut to "The Reef" where SpongeBob and Squidward, as an ice cream cone, are watching a movie. Ice cream cone tilts over into SpongeBob's arm and makes him smile. Cut to SpongeBob reading Squidward a story. Cut to the beach where SpongeBob and Squidward are lying on a towel trying to get a tan. SpongeBob looks over and notices melting ice cream cone] Whoa-oh! [a beach goer, who is trying to catch a Frisbee, slips in the ice cream cone. SpongeBob screams, then runs over to Squidward] Squidward! Speak to me! Speak! [breathes heavily as he runs to his house and puts the cone in the freezer] Hey, Squid, are you okay? [closes freezer door then reopens it] Hey, Squid, are you still okay? [winks, then closes door, reopens it again screaming then laughing] Hey, Squidward, I got something for ya! Someone to keep you company in that drab ol' freezer. [set a pink ice cream cone next to Squidward] Oh, aren't they cute? I promise to stand by as an eternal guard over my buddy.
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?
SpongeBob: I have turned poor Squidward into a frozen dessert.
Patrick: That's awful. How tragic. Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: It's all my fault.
Patrick: Did you say frozen dessert? [takes the green ice cream cone out of the freezer]
SpongeBob: Yeah. I turned him into a tasty soft-serve with a waffle cone. [cries]
Patrick: Oh...soft serve. [licks ice cream cone]
SpongeBob: [yells as he points to the ice cream] Patrick! Stop eating Squidward!
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [licks it a few more times]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick licks it again] Pat...!
Patrick: But he's so tasty! [licks it more faster. SpongeBob screams, then he snatches the cone away from Patrick]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! Don't you understand!? [calmly] This isn't just your ordinary ice cream cone.
Patrick: It's pistachio.
SpongeBob: [frustrated] No! It's Squidward! [ice cream begins to melt as SpongeBob is unaware] And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged. [Patrick is licking the melted ice cream off the floor. SpongeBob screams again, believing that his friend was deceased.] Patrick! Squidward has melted! Quick, call the police. What am I going to do?! Oh, Neptune, it's all my fault! What have I done?! What have I done?! [screams and hits himself in the face with the magic kit each time] It's all your fault! [throws the magic kit on the ground and stomps on it] Curse you, Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit! Curse you! Hey, that's it! That's the answer to our problems!
Patrick: [examines the torn box] Warning: From ages 9 to 99.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, the one mystic being that can help us: Mister Magic! [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick walking down a brown tileroad] Just follow the brown-tiled road to the most mysterious mystic of them all! No one's ever seen him in person.
Deep Male Voice: Enter! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a floating hat] Who dares to see Mister Magic?! [SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming] Speak up!
SpongeBob: It is I, SpongeBob of the SquarePants, Magician Level 1. And I have turned my friend into ice cream. [he shows him the cone floating in the melted green goo inside a jar, which is his "deceased friend"]
Mister Magic: [proudly] Good job.
SpongeBob: Well, thank you, but well, I can't change him back.
Mister Magic: Hmmm, um, well, have you ever thought of a different hobby?
SpongeBob: I need your help to change him back.
Mister Magic: My help? [sheepishly] Uh, no thank you.
SpongeBob: [still concerned] But if you don't, my friend will be a cone forever.
Mister Magic: Sorry, I... umm... I'm out to lunch, that's it.
SpongeBob: I'll wait.
Mister Magic: I'm on a two-year lunch.
SpongeBob: [still showing the jar] Oh, please.
Mister Magic: Silence! [Patrick notices something near the wall and walks to it]
SpongeBob: But, sir, no one else has your power of sorcery. [Patrick opens the curtain to reveal someone behind it making Mister Magic noises]
Mister Magic: Thank...you.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, there's a guy over here talking into a tubey thing.
Horace: Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.
Mister Magic: [simultaneously with Horace] Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.
Patrick: Why's he saying the same thing Mister Magic's saying?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir?
Horace: Well, I... uh... I'm Horace B. Magic.
SpongeBob: Are you Mister Magic?
Horace: [chuckles] Technically, yes. But the only magic around here is the magic of business. [shows a bunch of dollar bills]
SpongeBob: Does that mean you can't change my friend back?
Horace: [chuckles] I'm, I'm afraid not. So sorry about that, laddie. Your refund check is in the mail.
SpongeBob: I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways! [his eyes tear up] You have ruined my faith in the magical arts. [screaming, crying]
Horace: [frowns] Security. [SpongeBob and Patrick are booted out. Cut to both of them by Squidward's lawn chair with SpongeBob still crying over the "funeral" held for "Squidward"]
SpongeBob: [tears roll down his cheeks] What are we going to do about Squidward?
Patrick: We could always eat him. I'm kind of hungry. [stomach growls]
SpongeBob: Mister Magic was a fake and all his magic stuff is fake! All those magic words, they were fake. Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby, murkery, fool, magic of bloob-jiggacacies!... [continues to speak gibberish as a bus drives up and Squidward steps off, grinning in a friendly manner. He walks over to the lawn chair with the jar and the melted green ice cream, much to his disgust]
Squidward: Ew. [throws the jar with the cone in it away. The jar breaks] What are you doing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [stops crying] Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked. [puts on his magician hat] I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now? [motorcycle approaches]
Squidward: Hey, stop! [motorcycle stops and Squidward jumps on it] Get me out of here!
Patrick: [stomach growls] Hey, SpongeBob? I'm still hungry. Can you turn me into a jar of mayonnaise so I can eat myself?
SpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica. [Patrick is now a giant jar of mayonnaise. The jar sparkles]


Nematodes: Walking, walking, walking, walking. [continue to repeat "walking"]
Nematode #1: Hungry!
Nematodes: Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry. [continue to repeat "hungry." All eat a whole large piece of coral]
Nematode #1: Still hungry!
Nematodes: Still hungry, still hungry, still hungry, still hungry. [continue to repeat "still hungry." All eat a truck that drives by, leaving the driver floating]
Fred: Naw, dang nematodes!
Nematode #1: Thirsty!
Nematodes: Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty. [continue to repeat "thirsty." They all bounce to SpongeBob's house and take out some straws. Then start drinking up the pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are still sleeping as everything begins to shrink inside, even Gary's food bowl]
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed begins to shrink as he wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no! [squeezes through the door as he tries to get to the phone. Gary gets stuck in the door]
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Ow. Shell phone! I know. I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do.
Squidward: [on the other line] Hello?
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
SpongeBob: [as he talks to Squidward, his voice gets higher and higher and starts talking faster until the shellphone completely disappears] Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller, The walls are closing in on me, Squidward, Gary is terrified too! [the phone call is disconnected] Oh no!
Squidward: Yep, it is. [SpongeBob screams]
Patrick: [comes out from his rock] Is it time already to ruin Squid's day? [falls off rock onto his furniture, then jumps out with a tuxedo and tophat on] Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!
Nematodes: [continue sucking on SpongeBob's house, then they all burp and leave]
SpongeBob: Ohh... nematodes. [sees a seed on the ground, then picks it up] The only thing left of my house is this little pebble. [Patrick and Squidward walk up]
Squidward: What's going on here?
SpongeBob: I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! [sadly] It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
Squidward: [smiling] Yeah...
Patrick: [his eyes bulge excessively in surprise] Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!
Squidward: Well, what can I say? [begins to shake SpongeBob's hand] It's been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else. [walks back to his house] [sarcastically talks] I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo. [party favors fly out Squidward's windows as he parties] Boo-hoo! [starts to laugh]
Patrick: Squid's taking it real hard. So what are you gonna do now?
SpongeBob: I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad. [shown a picture of SpongeBob's parents smiling]
Patrick: No, wait a minute, no you don't. [shown picture of SpongeBob's parents frowning] We can build you a new house!
SpongeBob: We can't build a house!
Patrick: Well, sure, it's easy! I built my house all by myself! [antenna on Patrick's rock falls off]
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, lets get to work! [zoom in on SpongeBob and Patrick as construction workers] 
Patrick: [Patrick tries to hit a nail into a board, but hits his hand instead] Ow! Ow! Ow! [SpongeBob takes two buckets of paint, one red and one green. He pours the red paint on his backside and pours the green paint on his front side. He puts one side on a fence so that the paint gets on it, and then he does the other side the same way. He does this twice. As he tightens a loose bolt, the screen turns every time SpongeBob tightens the bolt sending Patrick sliding, falling upside down towards the sky, then back onto the ground right side up. SpongeBob nails pieces of wooden boards together in midair, and a piece falls off and lands on Patrick's hand, leading him to say "Ow!" each time. Patrick moves his board under the next board, which falls down on his hand. This happens several times. Next, shown SpongeBob's finished house, shown also with sparkles]
Patrick: [Patrick gives a big thumbs up with bandages wrapped around his thumb] We're done!
SpongeBob: Yeah! So what do you think?
Patrick: [SpongeBob's built house sparkles a bit] I wish I lived there.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: No. [SpongeBob puts the small pineapple on his head]
SpongeBob: One bedroom. [nose sticks out through the door and the pineapple breaks into pieces]
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
SpongeBob: [pets Gary] Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
Patrick: Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
SpongeBob: That'd be great!
Patrick: Yeah! We'll be rockmates! [SpongeBob and Patrick get ready to sleep under Patrick's rock] Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, rockmate.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [SpongeBob goes to sleep but then is awaken to Patrick's snoring] Oh...what the...? [Gary hides in his shell and SpongeBob puts a cork in each side of his head, and goes back to sleep. The wind blows and Patrick shivers, he then pulls the rock closer to him, SpongeBob shivers in the cold and pulls it back over himself. Gary sits on top of the rock as they keep pulling it back and forth until Patrick keeps the rock closer to him. SpongeBob gets cold and he covers himself with sand on and goes to sleep. Patrick starts drooling heavily, filling his mouth, and flows like a stream over to SpongeBob. As SpongeBob snores, he absorbs the drool coming from Patrick and becomes a fat sponge. He waddles over to Patrick and removes the corks, spilling Patrick's drool out of him and down-sizing him to normal size. Then he takes out a bigger cork and puts it in Patrick's mouth and goes back to sleep. Patrick struggles, then spits out the cork]
Patrick: [in his sleep] Oh! A spiders! Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Get 'em off, off me! Off, off, off! [lifts rock and starts smashing SpongeBob with it several times, he then goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, wake up! No, wake up! No, it's me! I'm SpongeBob! [moves away from the rock a few feet and goes back to sleep]
Patrick: Spiders! Spiders! [picks up his rock, runs over to SpongeBob, and smashes him repeatedly with the rock] Spiders! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, oh, oh, ow, ow, ow, ow! [Patrick goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: [in Squidward's house, he stands next to Squidward, holding Gary, as Squidward sleeps, he taps Squidward's nose as he whispers] Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] H-h-huh?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] Whoa. Huh? Wha-what?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever.
SpongeBob: Thanks. Thanks, Squidward. [gets in bed with Squidward] Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, oh, yeah, sure. [scoots over to the side]
SpongeBob: While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
Squidward: [sleepily] Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure. [Sleepily talks a bit, gets out of bed and walks off, then comes back with a glass of water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here. [Squidward hands SpongeBob the glass] Thanks, buddy.
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome. [SpongeBob drinks the water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I like sleepovers.
Squidward: [sleepily] Yeah. Me, too.
SpongeBob: Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
Squidward: [yawns] Good night, SpongeBob. [Squidward's eyes pop open. Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Gary walk out] [unhappy] Good night, SpongeBob. [night turns to day then rooster crows to wake everyone up. Squidward opens his eyes excitedly] Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late! [he flies into his closet, gets dressed, and goes outside] Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand outside, with bags] I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
Squidward: Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob. [changes his smile to a frown briefly] Please.
SpongeBob: Here come my parents. [Patrick beings to cry and the car horn sounds as SpongeBob's parents drive up]
Mrs. SquarePants: SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we're here!
Mr. SquarePants: Come on, SpongeBob, hurry, hurry, son, your mother has dinner waiting.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mom.
Squidward: Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags. [picks up the bags and carries them to the car]
SpongeBob: Just give me a minute. [walks back to where his house used to be] I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. [buries it into the ground in the middle of where his house used to be] You hold too many memories. [as he starts to cry, a tear falls from his nose and into the ground where the seed absorbs it, it then starts to glow. Then SpongeBob shakes Squidward's hand] Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. [walks away]
Squidward: Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye. [dances] Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye. [Patrick lies on the ground, bawling, as SpongeBob gets in the car]
Mrs. Squarepants: Come on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. [Patrick holds onto the back of the boat, lifting the front into the air, as he cries]
Squidward: [still dancing] SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving! [the seed shakes violently] La, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha! [the seed shakes even more violently] He leaving, ha ha! [seed still shakes, then it sprouts three roots] SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving! [Suddenly, the ground starts shaking. Squidward stops dancing, while SpongeBob, his parents and Patrick stare, bemused. A giant green stem grows out of the ground, SpongeBob's house grows from the plant and drops where his old house used to be and on Squidward. The stem then goes back into the ground]
SpongeBob: My house is back! [SpongeBob, his parents, and Patrick all happily run into the pineapple] Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be! [continues praising all of the returned belongings he possessed in his original house. SpongeBob returns to Squidward lying under the floor] Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
Squidward: [muffled] Forever?


Narrator: Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends. [shows fishermen in boats fishing near the Bikini Bottom atoll]
Squidward: SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
SpongeBob: Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table 9. [uses himself as a cleaning tool]
Mr. Krabs: They're back! They're back, I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes! [everyone looks at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] The hooks! The hooks!
Fred: How about a mint?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! The hooks!
Tom: Can you make that to go?
Squidward: [gives Tom his food in a bag] You don't know how lucky you are.
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! So there I was, minding my own business...
Squidward: I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, uhmmm... I have to do my waste basket inspection. [puts a trashcan on his head] Uh-huh, mmhmm, oh, yeah, there's one.
Mr. Krabs: Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya!
SpongeBob: Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks, me bucko! They're back. Beware the hooks!
SpongeBob: The hooks?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. [shapes his arm like a hook as SpongeBob looks at his arm] The hooks. [The camera shows SpongeBob's face with a reflection with Mr. Krabs' arm as a hook] They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches... [grabs Scooter's pants and lifts high like he is giving him a wedgie. His drink decreases every time Mr. Krabs grabs his pants as he sips it] ...and haul you way up high! Then higher, AND HIGHER, AND HIGHER [he opens a hatch on the roof and points at the surface] until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath! And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya... or worse!
SpongeBob: [gasps] What could be worse than that?!
Mr. Krabs: Gift shops. [shows gift shop and the inside of the gift shop]
SpongeBob: [gasps and hides under a box] Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen! Time is money!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs! [goes in the kitchen with the box on him]
Patrick: [pokes his head through one of the kitchen windows] Gooooood morning, Krusty Crew.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go!
SpongeBob: I can't leave now. I'm working.
Patrick: It's not leaving. You're just taking a break. [SpongeBob goes outside behind unseen] We're going to the carnival, we're going to the carni... [trips and falls on face] We're going to the carnival, we're going to the carnival! There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town! [many hooks are dangling] I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
SpongeBob: Where is everybody?
Patrick: I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier. [a pair of kids' sneakers lie on the ground nearby]
SpongeBob: Doesn't look like any carnival I ever... [bumps into a hook] Excuse me. [gasps as he sees the hook as the camera shows SpongeBob's face again with the reflection with a hook] Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks! Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!
Patrick: [sits on a hook] Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese.
SpongeBob: All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!
[Patrick is putting the cheese in his mouth]
Patrick: Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it! [the hook where Patrick ate the cheese from is pulled up]
SpongeBob: [faces another hook with cheese attached to it] But, Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: SpongeBob, let me ask you something. [the hook that SpongeBob is facing is pulled up. Patrick is shown with 9 hooks in his mouth and still has 1 in his hand] Does this look dangerous?
SpongeBob: [screams] Patrick, don't!
Patrick: Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... [hooks pulls him up]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back! Oh, my best friend! [Patrick floats down and SpongeBob runs into him as he hits the ground] Patrick, you're alive!
Patrick: Am I ever! You should try it.
SpongeBob: But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?
Patrick: You just jump off before you go up too high.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
Patrick: Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? [he jumps on a fish-like attachment on the hook]
SpongeBob: Well, no.
Patrick: Wheeee!
SpongeBob: I guess he didn't! [he jumps on the attachment with Patrick]
Patrick: Hi-yo, Silverfish! AWAYYYYYY!!!! [The hook pulls them up. We see a fisherman reeling in his fishing rod. We see SpongeBob and Patrick laughing out of enjoyment. The camera alternates between the fisherman and his partner to SpongeBob and Patrick. After a few cuts, SpongeBob and Patrick are about to jump off]
SpongeBob: Ready?
Patrick: Ready!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Geronimo!! [jump off]
SpongeBob: This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab! [On the surface, the fishermen are having a smoke break, disappointed at having lost their catch. Cut to the exterior at the Krusty Krab when customers are muttering angrily. We cut to see Ivy mad with Harold]
Ivy: P.U.! [points at his Krabby Patty] You call this food?!
Harold: My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!
Another Harold: [Starts holding up his fried boot] My sandwich is a fried boot!
Fred: Hurry it up, will ya?! We're hungry over here! Look at us! My kids haven't eaten and I'm dying! [customers muttering angrily... all talking at once; Squidward frantically flipping burnt patties] That's not how you're supposed to flip it!
Fish: Can you see, we're hungry! That's wrong!
Female Fish: I want a nice good meal!
Squidward: [defensive] WHY DO YOU WANNA EAT THIS STUFF ANYWAY?!?
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
Squidward: It's a feeding frenzy, sir! And SpongeBob's not back from his break. [Mr. Krabs laughs] What?
Mr. Krabs: I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taken a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59. [laughs] Now, what were you saying?
Squidward: He took a break.
Mr. Krabs: [stares in shocked silence, as his arms and nose fall off. He then storms out the front door] Alright, SpongeBob LAZY Pants! I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues. [uses his nose to smell] Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget!
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I still need help! [all the customers pick up Squidward like they are a mob]
Mr. Krabs: [uses his nose to smell again] They should be right here. [SpongeBob and Patrick float down as they are laughing]
Patrick: Again?
SpongeBob: Again!
Mr. Krabs: The hooks!! No! No! No!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [pulling on hook] 1, 2, 3!
Mr. Krabs&#160;: Wait! WAIT...!!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Blastoff!! [hook pulls them up as Mr. Krabs slams into a rock]
Mr. Krabs: Boys! I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [sobs] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd... [SpongeBob and Patrick float back down while laughing] ...I'D THROTTLE 'EM! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
SpongeBob: I...I...I...
Patrick: I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride 'em up, and up, and up. Then you gently flow down!
Mr. Krabs: And do you know what happens when you don't float back down!?!
SpongeBob: Gift shop?
Mr. Krabs: Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna! [shows a can of tuna] With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise! [shows a jar of mayo while a female screams in the background]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [raises hands] We promise, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I need a sailor's promise! Repeat after me: yo-ho! Yo-ho! Near the hooks I'll never go!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yo-ho. Yo-ho. Near the hooks we'll never go.
[a hook pokes Mr. Krabs in the butt]
Mr. Krabs: [leaps up, holding his injured rear] YOW! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahh! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck! [they turn and rub their own behinds]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa, whew! Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. [Cuts to the exterior of SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'M READY! [comes running out of the house] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready, I'm ready... [Patrick comes out from his rock]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way! [crashes into his furniture]
SpongeBob: I always go to work this way.
Patrick: You're not going to work today. We're going to go play "Hooky"!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we promised.
Patrick: Well, I had my fingers crossed.
SpongeBob: You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us!
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
SpongeBob: Umm...
Patrick: See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun. [Patrick goes up and down the hooks] Come on, SpongeBob! You know you want to!
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another... [almost runs into a hook. Gasps] ...hook! [almost touches the hook but takes it back] Oh no. Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar. A deceiver. I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never! [goes back to hook] Is this seat taken? [hook takes him up, but when he comes down and turns around, it is shown that he is hooked at the pants] Whew! Glad I got that out of my system. [gasps] I'm hooked. And that means... [shows the tuna can with SpongeBob crammed inside] AAAAAHHH!!! HELP!! I'M HOOKED! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Pearl: Thanks, dad.
Mr. Krabs: Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
Mr. Krabs: Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
SpongeBob: Umm...no. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! Yes, you told me not to go near them!
Mr. Krabs: Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Of course not. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean, not exactly. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! YES I DID IT! I admit it! [cries] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me. [shows the hook to Mr. Krabs] I'm hooked!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy. [group of girls laugh. SpongeBob looks at his pants]
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls! [hook pulls him closer] D’oh, okay! I'm taking 'em off. I'm taking 'em off. [takes pants off] There.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... lad?
SpongeBob: [screams, after noticing the hook caught in his underwear] Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs! I can't do it. Anything but that!
Mr. Krabs: I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob. [he places a "Help Wanted" sign on the door] But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [hook pulls him a little closer] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise! [He holds on to a flower but the hook pulls him away. He holds on to the Krusty Krab signpost] Please save me, Mr. Krabs! [cries] I promise I'll be good! [underwear tears off] Whew! [the signpost flings him into the door naked, which makes the girls laugh]
Pearl: Oooh, look! It's SpongeBob NUDIE Pants! [SpongeBob screams and runs]
Squidward: [holding a fishing rod with SpongeBob's underwear on the hook] Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Squidward: Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. [both laugh. Shows SpongeBob running back to his house]
SpongeBob: The pants! The underwear! [cries]
Patrick: [bus drops off a can of tuna] Hellllo? Does somebody have a can opener?


[Episode starts at Squidward's house. Squidward is humming the "House Fancy" theme song while doing these activities. He places some tea on the table in front of his couch, then gets a stack of cookies, then picks up the remote, then fluffs both of his pillows, then sits down and turns on the TV. A square and a triangle are moving around, Squidward sips his tea, then the shapes turn into a house. A bird flies on the house, and a sound bubble comes out of his mouth that says "House Fancy". A rainbow and a chimney appears on the house, then the scene opens like a door, revealing Nicholas Withers.]
Nick: Hello, and welcome one and all, to a super special episode of House Fancy. I'm your host, Nicholas Withers. [Nicholas Withers appears on the screen] Our first, very special guest on today's show will be none other than... [Squidward's phone rings]
Squidward: Oh. [Squidward walks up to the phone. Then says hello's] Hello. Hello. Uh... [picks up the phone, and says it in a sweet voice] Hellooo!
Squilliam: Hellooo!
Squidward: [gasps] This isn't Squilliam Fancyson, my life long rival who I met in high school band class, is it?
Squilliam: The same. You wouldn't happen to be watching House Fancy, would you?
Squidward: I was, until you called.
Squilliam: Well, Squiddy, I enjoy our chats, but my catered lunch awaits. And you know how hard being fabulous is on an empty stomach! [laughs]
Squidward: Wait, why did you ask me if I was watching House Fancy?
Nick: [heard through phone] Sorry, Squilliam, but we've gotta get back to the show.
Squidward: Who's that talking in the background?
Squilliam: Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, Nicky dear. Well, toodle loo, Squidward. [it is revealed that he is on the program] Enjoy the program.
Nick: Okay, folks, we'll be right back after these important messages. [Squidward drops his tea cup. Scene then cuts to Nick and Squilliam] Welcome back to House Fancy. I'm Nicholas Withers. Here next to me is Squilliam Fancyson.
Squilliam: Hello, peasants. [Squidward is angry]
Nick: Let me start by saying what a lovely facade you have, Mr. Fancyson.
Squilliam: Why, thank you, Nick.
Nick: And your house doesn't look too bad either. [both laugh]
Squilliam: Oh, Nicky.
Nick: Camera crew, can we get a shot of Squilliam Fancyson's fabulous house, please? [zooms out, revealing that it looks like Squidward's house]
Squidward: Hey, that's no better than my house! [goes up, revealing that it is much larger than Squidward's house. Cut to the inside of his house]
Squilliam: I bid you welcome, to my foyer.
Nick: It's simply glorious!
Squidward: [mocking] It's simply glorious!
Squilliam: It truly is, Nicky.
Nick: It's like I've died and gone to fancy heaven! [scene cuts to the opening background. The bird's head gets replaces the "O", then cuts back to Squilliam's house] Is that what I think it is?
Squilliam: It sure is! It's a gilded door knob.
Nick: Absolutely magical!
Squilliam: Absolutely imported.
Nick: May I?
Squilliam: But, of course. [Nick turns it]
Nick: Ohhh... Lovely.
Squilliam: Ain't it?
Nick: Well, I have to say, Squilliam, and I think that I'm speaking for all of our viewers out there when I'm saying this. You, are truly a fancy man.
Squilliam: Well, all this gushing is perfectly deserved. [Squidward is mad] And now, I would like to present to you my most favorite room in the house. [Squilliam opens the door, revealing the bathroom] It's all custom. Ah, look at this, it's my jewel-encrusted toilet paper holder.
Nick: Such class! [Squidward is even more angrier, then some houses turn into the title, then cuts to Nick and Squilliam]
Squilliam: Come, let me show you the roof!
Nick: An elevator?
Squilliam: Watch your step. [Squilliam opens the elevator, then they step inside, and press the button that says "Roof"] This may take a while. Just sit back and relax. [water fills some of the elevator]
Nick: What the!? A whirl pool bath elevator?
Squilliam: I brought some soap. [Pours out soap. They then get to the roof] All ashore. Welcome to my rooftop garden! Romantic grotto, sparkling berry mineral soda waterfall, and my personal favorite, a 130-foot-long sculpture of my unibrow!
Nick: It's huge, and... lifelike!
Squilliam: If you look closely, you'll notice it's made entirely out of gilded doorknobs. [Closes in on the sculpture]
Nick: You have the fanciest... [phone rings]
Squilliam: Eh, what?
Nick: You have the fanciest... [phone rings again]
Squilliam: I have the fanciest ring? [rings again]
Nick: No, your phone is ringing.
Squilliam: Oh. [walks up to phone, and picks it up] Hello? Oh, yeah, hang on. [talking to Nick] Uh, it's for you.
Nick: Hello. Hello. [talks on phone] Hello. [cuts back to Squidward]
Squidward: Hello, my name is Squidward Tentacles, and my house is far fancier than that slob Squilliam's!
Nick: Really?
Squidward: Really!
Nick: Okay, we'll be at your house in two hours with a camera crew. [hangs up]
Squidward: [shocked] Two hours? But I haven't even had time to wash my hair. [screams] There's a stain on the rug! I'll just use this chair to hide it. There we go. Now I'll just... [screams again] There's a hideous hole in the wall! I'll just use this painting to cover it up. Perfect. [screams again, because there is a faded spot where the painting was] Oh, no! [looks at the time] Oh, I'll never get this place in shape in time! [notices SpongeBob in the window, who quickly disappears. Squidward runs to the window] SpongeBob! How long have you been spying on me?
SpongeBob: Umm... What day is it today?
Squidward: It's the day you go away and never come back.
SpongeBob: But, Squidward, if I do that, then how am I going to help you get your house ready for the big TV show?
Squidward: How did you know about that?
SpongeBob: I was spying on you.
Squidward: Do you want me to get the cops down here again? Because... [looks at the time again, then sighs] All right, fine. But one slip up, and you are out of here. Comprendo? [SpongeBob is behind him]
SpongeBob: Mucho comprendo, Señor Habanero! [Cuts to later]
Squidward: All right. First, I'm going to give you something so simple, a person without a brain could even get it done right.
SpongeBob: Whoo, that's good, 'cause I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend.
Squidward: Really?
SpongeBob: No, not really... He traded me these two chocolate bars for it.
Squidward: I don't care! Just use this paint to cover up that faded part on the wall right there. Don't touch anything else!
SpongeBob: Okay. [SpongeBob picks up the brush, then throws it away and absorbs the paint, then splatters the paint around]
Squidward: SpongeBob, what was that noise? [screams] Skin me alive and drench me in boiling oil! What have you done to my living room?! I told you just to paint the faded spot.
SpongeBob: Well, it all looked kinda faded. [Squidward hisses, then looks at the clock again]
Squidward: Never mind! Maybe it won't show up on camera. Here, help me move this sofa.
SpongeBob: You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to?
Squidward: Hang on, I'm trying to get the grip on the thing. Now don't move it till I say... [SpongeBob moves it on his foot] Ow! Okay, it's on my foot. Now don't... [SpongeBob moves it again] Ow!
SpongeBob: Okay. [moves it again, ripping off Squidward's toenail]
Squidward: Ow! SpongeBob, I told you not to move it until I say... [SpongeBob drops it on his foot] Ow! Why do you keep moving it?
SpongeBob: ‘Cause you keep saying “ow”! [Squidward screams, and lifts it up]
Squidward: I don't need you, I can move it myself. [slips on toenail, and trips]
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, you're so strong! [there is a crash] And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now. [doorbell rings]
Squidward: Oh, no, they're already here! Go get a vacuum and clean up all the sofa bits. I've gotta run upstairs and dress my wound!
SpongeBob: Roger! [SpongeBob walks on screen with a vacuum] Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him.[starts vacuuming] Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power. [SpongeBob struggles to flip the switch, and the switch breaks. The vacuum goes haywire, and vacuums up a rug, a plant, a sculpture of Squidward, then the sofa, then the book case, then everything else]
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob, I finished... What the? [everything in Squidward's house is in the vacuum, which looks as if it's about to explode]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off. [SpongeBob tries to turn it off, but gets sucked in]
Squidward: Come out of there. [doorbell rings again] Uh, hang on, please. [Squidward tries to push the bag, and the door bell rings again] Please, just one more minute, Nick! [door opens, and it's Patrick]
Patrick: Who's Nick? Sorry, Squidward. I couldn't wait any longer, I've gotta use your toilet. No questions! Thanks. [Patrick runs into the bathroom. We hear him groan, then the toilet flushes, then he comes out] Phew! I wouldn't go in there for a couple days. Or weeks. [He leaves the house. Squidward's toilet comes out of his bathroom groaning]
Toilet: Please, please, somebody put me out of my misery! [toilet jumps into Squidward's hands, coughing] Have mercy on my soul...! [toilet dies, then Patrick opens the door again]
Patrick: Oh, hey, Squidward, if you see SpongeBob, can you give him his brain back? I was borrowing it for the weekend. I'll just set it, uh... here. [Patrick puts his brain on the floor] See ya! [walks away, and the vacuum then sucks it up. SpongeBob is eating the chocolate bar]
SpongeBob: Thank you, Patrick! [the vacuum says that it's on full capacity]
Squidward: Oh, no! [Squidward's house explodes. Scene then cuts to the House Fancy background, then to Nick]
Nick: Hello, and welcome back to House Fancy. We're arriving at the home of Mr. Squidward Tentacles, who claims his house is far fancier than that of Squilliam Fancyson. Let's take a look. [both are shocked because of Squidward's house] Well, I, I, I... I'm not quite sure how to say this...
Squilliam: Go ahead, say it.
Nick: Squidward Tentacles, you seem to have ushered in an entire new era in house fanciness!
Squilliam: Huh?
Squidward: I have-... I have?
Nick: What you have done here hearkens back to the illustrious post-primitive movement popularized by famous designer Saul Limpkins. Say, was he a big inspiration for you?
Squidward: Why, yes. I've studied him for... years! [Squilliam gulps]
Nick: I would like to announce, that Squidward's house will be featured in an hour long, commercial free House Fancy special, and Squidward will be crowned House Fancy prince of the year! An honor which was originally to be bestowed upon Squilliam, but now isn't. [Squilliam falls]
Squidward: Yay! [Squilliam starts crying]
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help you redecorate. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed. [Squilliam cries harder]


[The episode opens with the outside of SpongeBob's house, cut to the inside of the pineapple and we see SpongeBob sleeping, his foghorn alarm clock goes off, SpongeBob and Gary wake up.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good morning to you, too, Gary. Help yourself to some breakfast kibble while I make ready for my day at the Krusty Krab. [gets out of bed while Gary just looks at him, SpongeBob takes off his pajama hat and places it on the coat rack, we see Gary standing in his path]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Finished your breakfast already, Gare? You always were a good little eater. [bursts open the kitchen door dressed]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: We can play fetch when I get home, Gary. Right now Mr. Krabs needs me. There's leftovers in the fridge if you get... [is about to walk outside and opens the door to find Gary stuck to the outside]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Ah! Gary, what has gotten into you? Is there something important that you'd like to tell me? [Gary holds up a calendar showing that it's Sunday the 26nd. He points to it] Ah! Today is Sunday?! But that means...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah. That's exactly right, Gare-bear. I can't go to work today. [takes off his hat] The Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays. [gets back in bed] Gee, Gary, I was really looking forward to work. Now what purpose could today possibly have? [phone rings] Yeah, Mr. Krabs, did you me to come into work today? Oh. Hi, Sandy. Yeah... No... No, just me and Gary... No. I don't know yet... No, I'm not sick... You... need... a house-sitter?! Today?!
Sandy: That's right, SpongeBob. I know it's last minute, but...
SpongeBob: [at her house, still on the phone, not wearing his helmet] I would love to. [Sandy looks at her phone puzzled. Scene cuts to Sandy's treedome]
Sandy: Okay, SpongeBob, my treedome is a highly technical facility and there are many facets to its operation. [SpongeBob is staring at her] SpongeBob, are you getting all this?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Sandy: Here's a comprehensive list of "do"s and "don't"s to follow. [gives SpongeBob the list]
SpongeBob: Well, this looks easy to remember. It's just a little black smudge.
Sandy: [chuckles] That's to save paper. You'll need this special reading scope. [holds up the reading scope. SpongeBob takes it from her. He looks through it and sees the list clearer with lots of don't's]
SpongeBob: Oh.
Sandy: Now pay attention as I clue you in on some of your more elaborate responsibilities. This majestic structure is my kelp greenhouse. Its functions are complete automated, so all you have to do...
SpongeBob: Wow...!
Sandy: ...is check this thermometer right here and make sure the temperature is normal. [SpongeBob takes down notes]
SpongeBob: Nor... mal." Got it. [he and Sandy are at a garage door opening] 
Sandy: And this is the robot warehouse. It's where I keep all my robots.
SpongeBob: That stands to reason.
Sandy: This part's easy. All's you gotta do is come in here and count every single one of these robots and make sure none of them's gone missing. [SpongeBob takes down notes again. Scene cuts to him and Sandy walking] You seem to be doing a good job paying attention, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I respect your meticulous nature.
Sandy: [blushes] Oh! Why, thank you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [concerned] What's next on the list?
Sandy: This here is my worm incubator. They're not set to hatch for weeks, but I just thought I'd show it to you anyway. [SpongeBob takes down notes again. Scene cuts to him and Sandy at a shelf] And last but not least is my collection of rare and fragile artifacts that has to be cleaned twice daily. Now are you sure you can handle all that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Trust me, Sandy. You've got nothing to worry about. Your beloved treedome is in my capable hands.
Sandy: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Sandy: Are you really sure?
SpongeBob: Really sure.
Sandy: Okay. [Scene cuts to her going on her bus to Texas. The bus drives away. SpongeBob looks at the list and goes into the kelp greenhouse. He closes the door. He checks the temperature]
SpongeBob: [taking down notes] Normal. [he then goes in the robot warehouse. He is counting the robots] 2,692... [He is wearing a hat. He types the something down on a gadget. The gadget takes out some paper with the words on it] 2,693... [types something again and the gadget takes out more paper] 2,694... [types something again but he types to much causing the gadget to take out lots of paper. He starts laughing. Suddenly, the gadget goes on fire and so does the paper then it disintegrates. SpongeBob leaves. Scene cuts to him wearing a dress while dusting Sandy's artifacts] Sandy said this collection of rare fragile artifacts needs to be gently cleaned twice daily. There we go. Not a speck of dust anywhere. Wait a minute. [turns a skull head around and spots a dot on it] Aha! [takes a feather off the duster and dusts the dot off] There... we go. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob checking the worm incubator] Worm incubator. Well, looks like everything's fine here. [there is a squishing sound] What the...? [a worm starts to hatch] Ohhh! Sandy said these wouldn't hatch for... [checks the list] ...weeks! What is going on?! [Patrick's head pops up] Oh! Patrick? [Patrick pops out of the hole wearing his helmet]
Patrick: SpongeBob! There you are!
SpongeBob: Oh, what a relief. I thought you were a horrible mutant worm who was about to soak me with digestive juices and slowly consume me over a period of weeks.
Patrick: Nah, no thanks. I had a late breakfast.
SpongeBob: Why are you wearing that funny thing on your head?
Patrick: Well, because we can't breathe in Sandy's treedome, remember? It's filled with air.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me. I almost for... [dries up and starts gasping for water] P-P-P-Patrick! Help me! I-I can't b-b-b-breathe! [Patrick puts a water helmet on SpongeBob's head]
Patrick: There you go. [SpongeBob inhales and exhales]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick. You're a life-saver. Now that I haven't suffocated, it's high time I got back to this list of house-sitting duties. So without further ado, Patrick, [opens the door] I'd like you to please immediately exit the treedome.
Patrick: E-Exit the... Exit the treedome?!
SpongeBob: That's right. Exit the tree...
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, that's a great idea! Where should we go—Jellyfish Fields, Goo Lagoon, Barg'N-Mart, Lucky Larry's?
SpongeBob: Well, Lucky Larry's sounds fun.
Patrick: All right, let's go!
SpongeBob: Hold it! I promised Sandy I'd take extra-special care of her treedome while she's at the Inventor's Convention today. And that is exactly what I intend to do. Patrick, this is a major responsibility.
Patrick: Well, in that case, I'd better stay and help you.
SpongeBob: Nnnnope.
Patrick: Pleeease?
SpongeBob: Not gonna happen.
Patrick: Pretty please?
SpongeBob: No way.
Patrick: Pretty please with a scoop of vanilla ice cream?
SpongeBob: [scoffs] Yeah, right.
Patrick: Pretty please with a scoop of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, smothered in gooberberry sauce and topped with half a can of whipped topping?
SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you take me for?
Patrick: And a scoop of nuts!
SpongeBob: Deal.
Patrick: [jumps with joy] Hooray!
SpongeBob: But you have to promise not to touch anything.
Patrick: [raises his left hand] I, Patrick Star, hereby promise not to touch anything.
SpongeBob: Okay. Now, let's check the list to see what's nex... [alarmed] Patrick! [Patrick is chomping on Sandy's artifact shelf. SpongeBob runs over to him]  Patrick, no! You promised me you weren't gonna touch anything!
Patrick: [puts his water helmet back on] I wasn't touching anything!
SpongeBob: Then what were you just doing to Sandy's collection of rare and fragile artifacts?!
Patrick: Um... Tasting it.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, I insist. From now on, you must stick to me as closely as possible. Do I make myself perfectly clear? [Patrick doesn't answer] Patrick, I said, do I make myself perf... Patrick! Patrick? [turns to see Patrick sitting on his back]
Patrick: Is this close enough?
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick under Sandy's tree]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, tell me again what it is you're gonna do.
Patrick: Not... touch anything.
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm. What else?
Patrick: Not do anything.
SpongeBob: And...?
Patrick: Not... look at anything.
SpongeBob: Until when? Until...?
Patrick: Until... SpongeBob is done house sitting.
SpongeBob: [pats Patrick's head and Patrick barks] Good boy, Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:  Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Uh, can I... can I... can I... can I... can I...
SpongeBob: Patrick, how many times did we---
[SpongeBob drops a flask on the floor and it rolls into the robot warehouse. the robots get released and completey destroy Sandy's treedome.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-oh!
Patrick: Wasn't me!
SpongeBob: Well, I, I guess I can't handle it after all I... I'm a failure! [SpongeBob cries]
Patrick: Hey, buddy, it's not as bad as it seems.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, what makes you say that?
Patrick: Well, not everything is broken.
SpongeBob: [cries until Sandy came back and gasps] Sa..S...S..San....Sandy! [Sandy walks in shocked by the destruction] How was the inventors convention?
Patrick: Did you bring back any souvenirs?
Sandy: Funny, y'all should ask that.
SpongeBob: It is?
Sandy: Yep. I brought home something real handy.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasp]
Sandy: And I'm setting it to maximum power.
Patrick: SpongeBob, this is it, our final goodbye.
SpongeBob: I never thought I go out like this.
Patrick: At a handsome squirrel?
SpongeBob: No, with a fishbowl on my head.
[Sandy fires the laser and it restores her treedome just the way it was.]
Sandy: Eureka, it worked! The experiment is a success.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Experiment?
Sandy: That's right, boys. I wanted you to destroy my home all along so I can test this out this here rubble reverse ray blaster on some genuine rubble. I could've just smashed all this stuff up myself, but nobody destroys stuff up quite like y'all. You're not a failure SpongeBob, you're a scientist! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Patrick: Hooray!
SpongeBob: Hooray!
[The flask in SpongeBob's hand drops and starts rolling towards the robot warehouse.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy: Uh-oh! 
[The robots from the warehouse become free again and robots start destroying the treedome again.]
Patrick: Wasn't me!
Sandy: Quit your worryin', y'all. I can fix it all with my handy dandy rubble reverse ray blaster.
[Robot grabs the rubble reverse ray blaster out of Sandy's hand, smashes it, and leaves it on the ground.]
Robot: Ha, ha, ha!
SpongeBob: Silly old robot. He doesn't realize you have more than one of these ray guns. Isn't that right, Sandy? You do have more than one them? Don't you Sandy? [Sandy doesn't answer]  Sandy? [gulps]
[SpongeBob and Patrick leave the treedome nervously and Sandy gets angry.]
Sandy: SpongeBob!


[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house during the night. As SpongeBob and Gary are asleep, a worm appears at the window. The worm ties himself with a rope and shoots an arrow at SpongeBob's diving board. He dangles over SpongeBob and looks down at his holes. He cuts the rope with his teeth and parachutes into SpongeBob's hole, which immediately wakes SpongeBob up.]
SpongeBob: Hi. [looks up] Gary, I feel funny inside.
[Gary is still sleeping. SpongeBob digs his finger into one of his holes. The worm bites his finger.]
SpongeBob: Yow!
[SpongeBob looks inside his body and sees the worm.]
SpongeBob: Hello.
[The worm shivers.]
SpongeBob: Gary, there's something inside of me.
Gary: [wakes up] Meow.
SpongeBob: You see anything?
[Gary peeks inside SpongeBob's hole and sees the worm. He screeches and his eyestalks fly around inside SpongeBob's body. He catches the worm and struggles to pull him out. SpongeBob pulls Gary's eyestalks out of his body.]
SpongeBob: Gary the Snail, is that any way to treat an uninvited guest?
[The worm pops out.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello.
[The worm goes back in SpongeBob's body.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! That tickles! More like prickles. Hey, I think I'll call you Prickles!
[Prickles hides in SpongeBob's body and pops out in another hole.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] I see you!
[Prickles continuously goes in and out of SpongeBob's holes.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay, okay. Enough's enough. It's time for you to go, little guy. I already have a pet—Gary. I'm afraid I just don't need another one.
[SpongeBob tries to blow Prickles out of his body, but it doesn't work. He does it numerous times, but Prickles still wants to stay inside SpongeBob. SpongeBob runs out of breath and Prickles begins to cry.]
SpongeBob: Aw, stop, stop! Oh, Gary, I don't want to hear the little guy cry.
Gary: Meow.
[Prickles pops out and babbles his story to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [teary eyed] Such a sad story.
[Prickles babbles about staying for one night.]
SpongeBob: Okay, little buddy, but just for one night.
[Prickles kisses SpongeBob and goes back inside. SpongeBob gives Prickles a blanket.]
SpongeBob: Nighty-night, Prickles.
[SpongeBob and Gary go back to sleep. But as they sleep, Prickles wakes up and signals an airplane inside SpongeBob's house. The airplane drops off more worms and the worms parachute inside SpongeBob's body.]
SpongeBob: Huh?
[SpongeBob wakes up and sees Prickles and his worm friends disco dancing inside his body. Two worms are flashing lights with the music, the other two worms are blowing through their noisemakers, another is juggling fire clubs, and a clown worm is riding through the holes on a bicycle. As they continue to party, SpongeBob bounces along with the music.]
SpongeBob: Wow, a house party going on inside of me! Hey, why wasn't I invited? [laughs] I guess I was since I am the house! Look, Gary, now we have tons of prickly new friends! [shows Gary the worms]
Gary: [annoyed] Meow, meow.
SpongeBob: Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo!
French Narrator: 3,000 Wup-poos later...
SpongeBob: Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! Wup-poo! [babbling and humming]
[Gary slithers to the window and pulls the shades up. It is morning outside.]
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! I completely lost all track of time! Hey, uh, sorry to be a party pooper, guys, but I've gotta take a shower and get ready for work.
[But the worms are too distracted by the music and continue to dance.]
SpongeBob: Guys? Guy—guys?
[Gary growls at the worms and pushes SpongeBob with his eyestalks.]
SpongeBob: Gary, calm down. We're all friends here.
[One worm blows a raspberry at Gary. Gary has had enough with the worms and pushes SpongeBob out of his house.]
SpongeBob: Ow! [gasps and pulls his underwear up] Open up, Gary! I'm still in my underwear!
[Gary throws out a pair of pants.]
SpongeBob: Gary, I need to take a shower.
[Gary throws out a stick of "Stinky Pits" deodorant. SpongeBob rubs his armpits with the deodorant. Nearby, a mother and a child are watching what SpongeBob is doing.]
Debbie Rechid: I did not need to see that! Ugh!
[The mom jumps into the baby carriage and drives off. SpongeBob throws away the deodorant stick and puts his pants on.]
SpongeBob: All right, I guess you guys will just have to stay and go to work with me. Just keep a low profile or I could lose my job.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob flipping patties at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs enters the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: Eh, SpongeBob. Did ya clean out the— [gasps as he sees the worms in SpongeBob's body] Sweet Dutchman's ghost! [rubs his finger against SpongeBob's body] When's the last time you took a bath, boy-o? You're riddled with vermin.
SpongeBob: I—I d—d—don't know what you mean, sir.
[SpongeBob inhales his worms into his body, but he runs out of breath and the worms fly out.]
Mr. Krabs: If customers find out you're touching patties with your wormy hands, the health department will shut us down for sure.
[SpongeBob's hands are covered with worms.]
SpongeBob: I understand, sir. Mr. Krabs, will you excuse me for a second? [whispering] Prickles, you heard my boss. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you and your friends to leave, please.
[Prickles goes inside SpongeBob's head and types out on a piece of paper.]
SpongeBob: [reads paper] "Squatters rights?" What the heck is squatters rights?
Mr. Krabs: [takes paper and reads it] Oh, they're "lawyering" up, boy-o. They're makin' a legal claim to keep living in your body.
SpongeBob: It's okay, Mr. Krabs, they're not hurting me.
Mr. Krabs: Son, you gotta understand. I can't have you work here in your present filthy "condisherin'."
[Prickles pops out and dumps garbage on the patties.]
Mr. Krabs: [irritated] Oh! That's the last straw! Mr. Squid—
Squidward: On it, sir! Hasta la vista, worm boy!
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob out of the restaurant with a broom. But as he pushes him out, the broom is now a really long pole made of a wooden plank, a tree trunk, a stop sign where Old Man Walker is tied up, and a flagpole where the flag is an inverted flag of Ukraine.]
Mr. Krabs: And don't come back until you're dewormed!
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do?
[SpongeBob tries to push some worms out of his body as Plankton walks by.]
Plankton: Hey, SpongeBo— Whoa! I see you've got yourself a little problem with the cooties.
SpongeBob: Yeah, and I lost my job over it.
Plankton: Lost your job you say? I might be able to help you, if you can do something for me.
SpongeBob: Anything, Plankton! Anything!
[Plankton puts on rubber gloves and grabs a tank of toxic gas for pests.]
Plankton: [chuckles] Ridding SpongeBob of his worms will put him forever in my debt. That secret formula is good as mine!
[SpongeBob picks Plankton up so he can enter his body and exterminate the worms.]
Plankton: Time to crash this lousy party. Get it? Lousy? Louse? Oh, I'm good.
[Plankton roars as he attempts to get rid of the worms. But the worms attack Plankton from left to right inside SpongeBob's body until they push him out. Plankton is now injured from his fight with the worms.]
Plankton: [groans] You're on your own, worm boy.
[SpongeBob is overwhelmed at his condition as the worms continue to party inside.]
French Narrator: Soon after...
[SpongeBob continues to fight off the worms as he runs over to Patrick's house. He knocks on the rock as the worms continue partying in his body. Patrick opens up.]
Patrick: Hello?
SpongeBob: You gotta help me!
[The worms cover around SpongeBob's eyes and mouth to make a scary face.]
Patrick: Ah! It's a monster with SpongeBob's voice!
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, wait, don't close the—
[Patrick shuts his rock.]
SpongeBob: Aw! Hmm?
[SpongeBob sees Squidward entering his house and attempts to walk over to him.]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! [his eyes and mouth are covered with worms] I need a hug!
[Squidward screams, takes out a hose, and sprays SpongeBob with water. SpongeBob's body becomes filled with water. A worm swims inside SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Does that mean no hug?
Squidward: There will be no hugs! Get away from me, you monstrosity!
[The worms jump out of SpongeBob and swim over to attack Squidward. Squidward screams and runs into his house. The worms go back inside SpongeBob as he sulks his way to his house, which is boarded up by Gary. Gary growls as SpongeBob walks until he stops. He turns around and his body has become an apartment. One of the worms is seen hanging her laundry on her clothesline. SpongeBob opens his body and sees various worms doing their daily activities. One elderly worm is watching television, two worms are hanging out at a jacuzzi, another worm is rap dancing, and one cranky worm is knocking on the ceiling with a broomstick. SpongeBob closes his body as he has completely lost his sanity.]
SpongeBob: Well, this is my life from now on, huh? [laughs] Just call me SpongeBob WormPants, cause that's all I am, just an apartment for worms! [laughing]
[As SpongeBob loses his sanity while laughing uncontrollably, the worms become annoyed by his constant laughter as he is shaking his body. The worms have had enough with his laughter and decide to leave his body once and for all. They gather up all of their stuff, load up their mini van, and exit SpongeBob's body.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, that's better. Looks like I really wormed my way out of that one. [laughs as Gary slithers up to him]
Gary: [sniffs] Meow!
[SpongeBob hugs Gary.]
SpongeBob: Gary, it feels so good to be worm free!
[SpongeBob carries Gary into his house. The worms that left SpongeBob's body enter Squidward's house and begin partying inside.]
Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob! I need a hug! [The short "Clam Up!" plays]
[The short opens with Prickles getting out of his house, which is a can of beans, one morning with sunglasses on. He walks to a mousetrap, opens it, and sits on it. He puts a sun reflector on him and drinks some lemonade. A shade comes upon him, and when he slightly takes off his sunglasses, he sees a giant clam on top of a piece of coral, squawking. He yells at it, but the clam continues squawking. He moves the mousetrap away from the shade, and gets tired after pushing it. He goes back on it and gets his sun reflector again, but the clam squawks even more louder than before. He takes off his sunglasses and throws a boot at it, then puts his sunglasses back on to relax some more. The clam goes beside him and squawks loudly at him, shocking Prickles and causing him to get trapped inside the mousetrap, which also makes the clam laugh]
[Prickles then cooks his beans on a pipe. The clam comes back and sniffs the smell coming from the beans. As he's cooking, the clam spits on him and eats the beans. He kisses Prickles, and when it leaves, Prickles rips off his clothing and yells for awhile, as two Bikini Bottomites walk by. He eventually gets tired of yelling and falls down]
[Prickles places a couple of beans in a line. The clam, who is flying around, sees the beans and eats them all, leading to the can of beans which the worm traps the clam in. He turns the can around, puts a stamp on it, and throws it into a mailfish's package as he was walking by. He waves goodbye and goes back to his house, only to realize he sent his house away and slaps his nose]
[At night, Prickles is walking with a hobo stick, scared of the surroundings. He gets shocked when he sees the mailfish severely beaten up. He also sees that the can of beans has been opened, and the clam appears behind him. He gets extremely scared, and the clam attempts to eat him after roaring at him. He hides behind a piece of coral as the clam is looking for him, and when the coast is clear, he comes out. He sees SpongeBob's house, and goes in there through the window.]


Patrick: [screaming while flying on his sandboard, then bashes his body on mountain. The word “DEAD” flashes, also making a "dead" sound effect]
[Screen zooms out, revealing that Patrick is only playing a video game with his character while sandboarding down Sand Mountain]
Patrick: Aww, I got dead again. This game stinks. [hits a rock and flies and screams then bashes his body on mountain just like on his game]
Sandy: See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.
SpongeBob: I'm listening to you, mountain! [starts sandboarding, and he passes by Patrick's legs] Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, yeah, I forgot. [eats yellow sand on a plate]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, watch me do the "Grouchy Squidward".
Squidward: [sits at a table drinking tea close to the mountain] Stop naming moves after me!
SpongeBob: [imitating Squidward] Everybody's an idiot except for me.
Squidward: Well, it's true. [takes a sip]
[SpongeBob laughs like Squidward, Sandy and Patrick laugh with him]
Sandy: [stops laughing and gasps] SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!
SpongeBob: [stops laughing like Squidward] Huh? [avoids tree with scuba diving gear on it] Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, ‘cause I'm an... [hits a log and he goes off the mountain] Expert...! [suddenly stops in mid-air] Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down. [camera reveals that SpongeBob is upside down and not the mountain and he screams as he falls]
Sandy: SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!
SpongeBob: [makes himself right-side up and he takes off his pants] Like this?
Patrick: No, your other bottom!
Sandy: Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?
Patrick: Not until 4.
[SpongeBob crashes into the ground and his bottom breaks into tiny pieces]
Sandy: Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
Patrick: Do it again! I wasn't looking!
[Cuts to the doctor's office]
Doctor: Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.
SpongeBob: My what has a what now?
Doctor: Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing. [he turns an x-ray on] It took twenty hours to put it all back together. [he holds a stapler] We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick [he holds a glue stick]. Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, I'd like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there. [points to where the fish is] [we see Tom and his butt is in a giant machine] In the Iron Butt.
Tom: [in the Iron Butt] Aww, man. It itches.
SpongeBob: [outside hospital] You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol. [sees Harold behind him] Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!
Harold: What's your problem? [leaves SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Whew. That was close.
Football Player: Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us? We need an extra player. [another football player catches a football] Nice catch, Percy! [slaps Percy's bottom, SpongeBob cringes as he holds his butt]
Jimmy: Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams as he turns around, while holding his butt] You've gotta try this, dude! We finally got enough people for a seven-mile spanking machine! [crawls between people's legs, who each take turns spanking his butt] Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch.
Martin: Next. 
SpongeBob: No! [screams as he runs off. Everybody looks at him]
Squidward: Is this where the line starts? 
SpongeBob: My butt is not safe out here! [runs inside his house and closes the door] No part of me is safe! [closes the window curtain] 
[Patrick and Sandy return from another trip from Sand Mountain] 
Sandy: Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy! [Patrick starts laughing as they enter SpongeBob's house] Hey, SpongeBob! 
Patrick: [is still laughing while riding on Sandy's back; Sandy glares at him and he gets off her back as well as clearing his throat afterwards] That was fun. [he stops smiling] 
Sandy: [Patrick smiles again] Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob? 
[SpongeBob is sitting in a fetal position in the middle of the floor, with a penny, a potato chip, and a wadded-up napkin lying on the floor in front of him] 
SpongeBob: [with a little smile on his face] Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world? 
Sandy: Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that? 
SpongeBob: Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again. 
Sandy: That's crazy talk! 
Patrick: That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk. [does various forms of gibberish blabbing, but his third blabbing makes his saliva hit Sandy, making her hammer-fist him to shut him up, bashing his head in] Sorry. 
SpongeBob: No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead. 
Patrick: Or your other armpit! 
SpongeBob: I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary. 
Sandy: Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome? 
SpongeBob: I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny... [holds up a penny] and Chip... [holds up a potato chip] and say hello to Used Napkin. [holds up a used napkin] 
Sandy: Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab? 
SpongeBob: No problem! [he grabs the end of a spatula, which is so long it stretches all the way inside the Krusty Krab] A really long spatula. [flips a patty with the really long spatula] 
Sandy: What about eating? 
SpongeBob: I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed. [breathes in a different and weird way] 
Sandy: SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside! 
SpongeBob: Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again. 
Patrick: Never ever? 
SpongeBob: Never ever ever! 
Patrick: Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?! 
SpongeBob: Never ever never never ever ever never!! 
Patrick: Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?! 
SpongeBob: [sighs exasperatedly] Never ever... 
SpongeBob and Patrick: Never never never never ever never ever never… 
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door? [throws Chip to the door, opening it, and Patrick and an angry Sandy leave] 
Patrick: Thank you, Chip. [closes the door. Outside, Sandy is still glaring at SpongeBob] I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward! 
Squidward: [pops out of his window] No! [slams his window shut] 
Patrick: Aww! 
Sandy: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of. 
Patrick: And that's when I [holds a boxing glove] punch him, right? [Sandy gives a bummed look. Patrick and Sandy are jellyfishing outside SpongeBob's house] 
Sandy: Look at all the jellyfish out here. Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun. 
Patrick: [catches a jellyfish] I caught one! [puts head in net and his jellyfish sticks to his face] Huh? 
SpongeBob: [Patrick gets electrocuted in the background, making him scream in pain] Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting. [puts on a pair of glasses and a tiny net and waves it in the air] I think I caught one! 
Sandy: We've got to try something else! 
[Patrick and Sandy are holding a cake in front of SpongeBob's house] 
Sandy and Patrick: ♪Three cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob! Three cheers for you!♪ 
Sandy: Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish. 
SpongeBob: I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. ♪I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!♪ Take it away, Penny! [the penny lies silently on the floor] 
Patrick: [sniffles] That penny has the most beautiful voice. 
Sandy: [goes inside the window to angrily point at a smiling SpongeBob] That is it, SquarePants! We're gonna find you something that's so dang fun that you'll have to come outside! [goes outside] 
Sandy: [jumps on a trampoline] Trampoline! 
Patrick: [holds an ice cream cone] Ice cream. 
Sandy: [surfs on an underwater wave] Underwater surfing! 
Patrick: [holds two ice cream cones] Two ice creams. 
Sandy: [rides on a Ferris wheel] Ferris wheel! 
Patrick: [the two ice creams are melting] Still two ice creams. 
Sandy: [struggling with a giant clam] Clam wrestling! 
Patrick: [washes an old man in a tub] Washing an old person. 
Sandy: Patrick, that's not fun. 
Old man: It is for me! 
[SpongeBob is still "filter-feeding", and Sandy and Patrick watch him through his window] 
Sandy: Nothing's working, Patrick! 
Patrick: What do we do? 
Old man: [appearing from below] I say we take a bath! 
Sandy: Wha...will you get out of here? 
[Patrick and Sandy are hiding behind a coral bush and Patrick is in a gorilla suit] 
Sandy: Now remember. Don't jump out until I give the signal. 
Patrick: Right. [he zips up his mask] 
Sandy: [opens the door] All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat! [Patrick comes out in the gorilla suit and acts crazy like a gorilla] Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year. 
Sandy: [Patrick continues dancing] No, really! You've got to come and save me! [Suddenly, a second Patrick shows up out of nowhere with an ice cream] 
Patrick #2: Hey, Sandy, [SpongeBob gives a startled look] who's your friend?
Sandy: [Confused] But you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit.
Patrick #1: I am in the gorilla suit. [unzips the gorilla suit] I thought I was doing a pretty good job.
Sandy: If you're Patrick, then who's that? [The two look at second Patrick who unzips his head, which reveals a real gorilla underneath which scares them!] Ah! A real gorilla!
SpongeBob: [Shocked] Huh?! [The gorilla rips out of the Patrick suit it is wearing. Sandy and Patrick are screaming. The gorilla grabs the scared Patrick and Sandy, puts them in a bag, and repeatedly beats them] Oh, my gosh! [Sandy and Patrick are still screaming while the gorilla beats them] This can't be happening! [The gorilla hits Patrick and Sandy using a chair, then beating them some more] This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about! [the gorilla can be seen still beating up the sack outside the window; it also does things like dribbling the sack and bouncing on it like it's a ball] Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary.
Gary: [eats Chip, killing him] Meow.
SpongeBob: [looks behind] Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world. [gulps and shakes as he reaches for the door. The door shakes as well until SpongeBob opens it] I'm taking my [walks slowly] first step. [continues walking] So far, so good. I think I can do this! [the wind blows a piece of paper onto his face; SpongeBob screams] Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me! [Squidward waters his plants and rolls his eyes and SpongeBob removes the paper off his face] I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now! [the gorilla grabs SpongeBob] Is it too late to go back inside again? [the gorilla rips SpongeBob in half]
1st half of SpongeBob: It's too late. [the gorilla screeches] Patrick? Sandy?
Patrick and Sandy: [still in the bag] Yes, SpongeBob?
1st half of SpongeBob: I'm sorry I caused all this. I'm not scared of going outside anymore. But I'm terrified of gorillas now.
Sandy: [shaken] Ah, that's okay, SpongeBob. Us too.
First half of SpongeBob: You know what I don't understand though? [moves to the second half of SpongeBob]
Second half of SpongeBob: What?
First half of SpongeBob: What's the gorilla doing underwater in the first place? [the gorilla's eyes widen]
Gorilla: [man's voice] Oh! Well, it's funny you should, uh, you see, George, they're on to us! [A zebra rushes onto the screen]
George: Let's get outta here! [the gorilla gets on George and rides away with him. Patrick, Sandy, and the two halves of SpongeBob are watching the gorilla ride on George into the sunset. Text reads: The End. The screen zooms out to reveal a live-action family watching the episode on TV in bemusement. The father turns to the mother and gives her a confused look. He shakes his head, and eventually turns off the TV]


SpongeBob: [Gary is on his exercise wheel] Exercise time is over, Gary. [takes Gary off his wheel] We don't want you getting too thin. [holds up a green, squishy ball] Here, boy. Fetch! [throws it and Gary goes after it but at a slow pace. SpongeBob checks his watch and sits on a chair and takes out the newspaper to read. Morning arrives, the rooster crows and SpongeBob is asleep in the chair. Gary crawls up to SpongeBob and spits out the ball]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? [sees the ball on the ground]  Good job, Gary! [He jumps to Gary] I love you, Gary! [He starts scratching Gary and Gary purrs] Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary! [Gary climbs up on SpongeBob, purring and tickling him] Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha! [Patrick comes through the door]
Patrick: SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
SpongeBob: For what?
Patrick: The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend! [shows his jellyfishing net off until he breaks something and blushes with embarrassment] So, you ready or what?
SpongeBob: That was this weekend? [He looks up at Gary who's still crawling all over him trying to tickle him] I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
[There's a knock on the door. Squidward is seen outside. The door opens, but the first thing Squidward sees is Gary on SpongeBob's head. He looks down at SpongeBob and reveals a pair of underwear.]
Squidward: Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
Squidward: What's a Gary?
SpongeBob: Not a Gary. Gary. He's my pet snail. [shows Gary to Squidward] Say hello! [Gary hisses at Squidward and drools]
Squidward: Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
SpongeBob: I love Gary!
Squidward: Well, I don't. Get somebody else. [walks off]
SpongeBob: I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick. [Squidward stops]
Squidward: Go away? [walks in reverse back to SpongeBob's Pineapple] You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
SpongeBob: Actually, a three day weekend.
Squidward: As in, not here for three days?
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.
Patrick: Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
Squidward: I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
SpongeBob: You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk.[SpongeBob explains the daily routine with Gary, but Squidward is busy thinking of how much fun he'll have with SpongeBob &amp; Patrick away]
Squidward: Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend.
SpongeBob: Let me show you how to feed him. [opens a cabinet with six barrels of Gary's food] The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
Squidward: Sure it's enough? [bus drives up to the pineapple with other jellyfishers inside]
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Patrick: The bus is here! The bus is here! [crashes through the wall and through the bus leaving his starfish shape through each hole] C'mon, SpongeBob!
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Squidward: [pushing SpongeBob out of the house] Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye bye.
SpongeBob: Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
Squidward: I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.
SpongeBob: Gary.
Squidward: Right, yeah, right. [bus drives off] Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers! [laughs with joy] They're gone! [runs inside his Easter Island Head. Gary peeks his eyes out the window]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: [comes out with shorts on and his nose with sunscreen on it and a chair. Unfolds the chair and sits on it] This is going to be the best three days of my life. [sighs and lays back with a sun reflector in front of him] I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob. [The time card "3 Days Later" appears, and now Squidward is badly sunburned, The bus comes back as the group is chanting "jellyfishing"] Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me. [Squidward sees Gary through the window. Gary groans. Squidward's sunburn drains] [screams] The snail! I forgot the snail! [runs inside the pineapple where Gary is old and withered on the floor. Squidward frantically takes him inside to the kitchen] I've got to do something. [takes all the barrels of food and puts it in his bowl] Okay, okay, okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here. [Squidward frantically throws the food at Gary's trying to get him to eat it] [Gary lip syncing what Squidward's saying]: Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat! You've gotta finish this food!
SpongeBob: See you later, Patrick.
Squidward: Come on, eat! Eat! Eat! [SpongeBob gets his house key out. Squidward has to decide about the food] Ohh...
SpongeBob: [sticks the key in the hole and opens the door] Gary! I'm home!
Squidward: [greets SpongeBob with a head full of Gary's food that he ate] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Squidward! What are you doing here? [Squidward swallows all the food]
Squidward: Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
SpongeBob: What a great friend you are, Squidward.
Squidward: So, uhh, well, see you. Goodbye.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. [Gary crawls to SpongeBob, still old and wrinkly] I can always count on you. [Gary moans and SpongeBob screams] Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward! [Squidward frowns ‘cause he can't leave. Later, the doctors snail-mobile is in front of the pineapple]
Brock: Yes, yes, it's just as I thought.
SpongeBob: What?
Brock: This is definitely a snail.
SpongeBob: I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that?
Brock: Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered. Here you go. [hands the shot to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Aren't you going to do it?
Brock: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm too squeamish. [doctor leaves. Squidward runs after him]
Squidward: Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.
Squidward: Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do... [Gary moans and coughs badly]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: Okay, okay, I'll do it. [takes the shot]
SpongeBob: Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady. [Squidward tries to give Gary the shot but SpongeBob pulls him away] Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again. [Squidward keeps trying but gets the same result every time]
Squidward: Will you hold him still? [snail plasma shot in SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.
Squidward: Well, you made me do it!
SpongeBob: What's going to happen to me?
Squidward: Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.
SpongeBob: I don't know, I feel kind of funny!
Squidward: I'm telling you, it's all in your head. [Gary crawls to his water bowl to get a drink. After drinking the water, he gargles, clears his throat, and meows normally again.]
Squidward: He just needed water?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you're better! [hugs him]
Squidward: Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
Squidward: Trust me, SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine. [closes door]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
Gary: [jumps up] Meow! [SpongeBob pours food into Gary's bowl, but decides to see what it tastes like. He likes it so he eats all of it. Then walks to Gary with the empty bowl]
SpongeBob: Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself. [burps] Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top! [SpongeBob begins to walk out of the kitchen. His feet make loud pounding noises as they hit the floor, and he begins to go slower and slower. Soon Gary is going faster than he is.]
SpongeBob: Gary, you're getting a [voice slows, lowers] lot faster! [SpongeBob sluggishly walks into the bathroom, and Gary follows him. He looks in the mirror, and his voice echoes as he speaks.]
SpongeBob:  Look at me. Never better. [He yelps as dramatic music begins to play in the background. His head begins to throb, and his pores begin to grow and shrink, before returning to normal.] I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine! [What he doesn't realize is that the worst is yet to come. His eyes bug out of his head, causing him to yell. The camera rotates around so we can get a side view of SpongeBob. He blinks, and his eyes briefly pop back into his head and return to normal. But this relief only lasts for about half a second. Then, his eyes bulge out even farther than before, and it looks very unnatural. They bulge for a while, and then they begin to transform, taking the shape and form of snail's eyes, with stalks. The sight causes SpongeBob's jaw to drop, and he screams louder. SpongeBob stares in the bathroom mirror at his brand-new eyestalks, which now have skin and eyelids around them. He turns to Gary.]
SpongeBob:  Gary... I'm fine! [But SpongeBob is not fine. Gary watches in horror as his owner falls onto his hands and knees, straining in pain.]
SpongeBob:  [in so much pain that he is barely comprehensible] Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see. [grunts and strains as his hand and arm slowly retract into his sleeve, which then pops off and bounces away] That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway! [Then, SpongeBob's feet and legs retract into his pants.]
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Ha! Now I don't have to buy those new shoes! [his body shortens up like a snail and he screams] I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeee [he loses the ability to talk and completes his snail transformation] ow!
Squidward: [in his bed with his clarinet] I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary. [a knock is heard on the door and the doorbell rings] Who could that be? As if I didn't already know. [Camera goes to Squidward’s front door. Squidward turns on the light, walks to the door, and opens it] SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just-- [attempts to say “fine,” but hesitates and shouts almost hysterically. SpongeBob is now a fully breaded snail.]
SpongeBob: Meow!
Squidward: [screams]
SpongeBob: Meow! Meow. [Squidward touches SpongeBob's left eye and it curls up]
Squidward: [screams and runs back inside shutting the door]
Squidward: SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done? [picks up the snail plasma shot] It's all your fault. [throws it away] Okay, okay, okay, okay, get it together, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Meow! [Squidward screams and puts boards on his door. Turns around and SpongeBob is at his window] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams] Meow! [Squidward puts more boards on his window, but SpongeBob squeezes through the boards holes] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams and runs into his closet]
Squidward: None of this would be happening if I'd only fed that snail! [SpongeBob squeezes in from under the door, and meows. Squidward screams and runs through his door, SpongeBob meows, Squidward runs up and down his ceiling, screaming and mumbling, while SpongeBob keeps meowing at him. Outside, his house is bouncing from side to side until it flips on its side completely. Everything is broken and torn inside. Squidward sits up, but is injected with the snail plasma through his nose]
Squidward: Uh-oh! [now SpongeBob, Squidward, and Gary are on a fence singing "Blow the Man Down"]
Gary: Meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A], meow [F] .
SpongeBob: Meow [A], meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A] .
Squidward: Meow [C], meow [D], meow [B♭], meow [A], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Gary: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G], meow [E] .
SpongeBob: Meow [G], meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Squidward: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [A], meow [G], meow [A], meow [F] .
Gary: [Off-screen] Meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A], meow [F] .
Patrick: [opens his rock. He is wearing pajamas] Will you clam up?! [throws a boot]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen at the same time] Meow [A], meow [C], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A] .
Squidward: Meow [C], me- [D] Ommf! [boot knocks him off the fence]
Gary: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G], meow [E] .
SpongeBob: Meow [G], meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Squidward: Meow [D], meow [D], meow [D], meow [D], meow [C], meow [A], meow [G], meow [A], meow [F].


SpongeBob: See anything yet, Patrick?
Patrick: I need my glasses. [puts two glasses of water on his eyes like binoculars, which are real human eyes.] Hmmm... [a mail truck approaches] ...it's the mail truck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Our package! [Patrick throws the glasses and they both start dancing and hopping]
Squidward: I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day.
Norton: SpongeBob SquarePants?
SpongeBob: That's me! [Norton throws a big box next to him and Patrick]
Squidward: That's a big box!
SpongeBob: Thank you! [still dancing and hopping]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?
SpongeBob: Thirty more seconds, Patrick. [rubs hands together]
Squidward: They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap. [laughs as SpongeBob and Patrick lift up a big-screen TV out of the box] Huh? A brand-new television?
SpongeBob: Easy... easy... [both him and Patrick throw the TV onto a trash-can]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah! [jump into the box and close the flaps]
Squidward: Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider. [walks up to the box with SpongeBob and Patrick inside] Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?
SpongeBob: [as he emerges from the box] Pretty smart, huh?
Patrick: [emerges from the box] I thought it wouldn't work.
Squidward: Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah. [yells in SpongeBob and Patrick's faces] Don't you two have any brains?!
SpongeBob: Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our... [makes a rainbow over his head with his hands] ...imagination!
Squidward: Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?
SpongeBob: With... [SpongeBob jumps on the flap of the box, makes another rainbow with his hands] ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate! [curls his finger in a hook shape] Arrrrr! A football player! [stands in a football player stance] Hup!
Patrick: A starfish!
Squidward: Patrick, you're already a starfish.
Patrick: See, Squidward? It works! You try!
Squidward: [rubs his two tentacles on both sides of his head] Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV... [points to the one on the trash-can] ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sure, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! [Squidward runs to the TV and pushes it to his house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!
Patrick: Let's play Mountain Climbing Adventure!
SpongeBob: Let's go for it! [pulls the flaps of the box over on them] Gloves!
Patrick: Check.
SpongeBob: Hats!
Patrick: Check.
SpongeBob: Underwear!
Patrick: Uh... check!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope.
Patrick: You got it! [climbing noises come from the box]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!
Squidward: I hope they put some air holes in that box. [goes inside his house]
SpongeBob: Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!
Patrick: I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo! Excelsior!
Squidward: [opens his door] Now where's that remote? [walks up to the remote, which is right next to the box. He picks it up, puts it in his shirt and stands next to the box, listening to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: I am the lizard king! Whoo!
SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!
Patrick: What should we keep down?
Squidward: Morons.
SpongeBob: Our voices!
Squidward: Will you two shut up?! [kicks the box, causing the sound of an avalanche, making SpongeBob and Patrick scream and fall, they both start to cry. Squidward is shocked] Sponge... Bob? [he softly touches the box, causing another avalanche]
Patrick: Hold me.
SpongeBob: Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!
Patrick: SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw! [Squidward begins to sweat]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I can't do that!
Patrick: Why not?
SpongeBob: Because I already cut off my own arms! [Squidward kneels down]
Patrick: Nooooo!
[Squidward quickly opens the box and looks in. SpongeBob and Patrick sit inside the box]
Squidward: [confused] What the? How were you two making that noise?
SpongeBob: [laughs] What noise, Squidward?
Patrick: I could only hear the sound of our laughter.
Squidward: Yes! But those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the...
Patrick: Don't forget the second avalanche.
Squidward: Forget it. [closes the box] I don't know why I'm wasting my time out here when I could be watching my brand new television. [helicopter sounds are heard from the box, Squidward looks around at the sky and ducks]
Pilot Inside Box: Attention climbers, please hold on! The saws are on the way!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
Squidward: Grrrr... Aha! [he opens the box again and sees SpongeBob and Patrick sitting inside the box again] How are you two doing that?
SpongeBob: First we establish a base camp at 15,000 feet...
Squidward: The noises! How are you two making those noises?
Patrick: That's easy. All you need is a box.
SpongeBob: And... [makes another rainbow with his hands] ...imagination.
Squidward: [as SpongeBob and Patrick duck down into the box] Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination... [tries to make a rainbow with his hands, like SpongeBob, but is unsuccessful] ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies.
Patrick: That's good. Now all you need is a box. [closes the box]
Squidward: [walks back to his house] I'll show them! [looks in his closet] There's got to be one in here! [finds a small, round green box] Ah! This hat box should do nicely. [pulls out a Mexican sombrero] Why haven't I worn this yet? [throws it off-screen, gets in the box but he is too big for it and then just sits there. He then frowns, looks at his watch and then gets mad and kicks the box. Police sirens are heard]
Policeman Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's box: Attention! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!
Squidward: What do they want with me? What did I do? [he gasps] Obviously I violated some new boxing law! [walks out of his house showing the green box] Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!
Criminal Inside Box: You'll never take me alive, coppers!
Man Inside Box: No, Johnny! Don't do it! [Police sirens are heard. Squidward gets angry and kicks his green box toward SpongeBob and Patrick's box]
Patrick: [opens box and sirens stop] Whoopee! Another box! [Patrick takes the hat box and closes the box they're sitting in and police sirens are heard again]
Squidward: I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV. [turns on TV to see a show with boxes on a conveyor belt in a factory]
Male TV narrator: It is here that the boxes reach their final stage of assembly. [changes channel to an old professor talking about a box equation on a chalkboard]
Professor: The equation is demonstrated here by this box. [changes channel to a soap opera with a man and woman]
Man: I couldn't afford a present this year, so I got you this box. [he holds up a box]
Woman: That's what I got you! [she also holds up a box]
Squidward: Isn't there anything on that isn't about boxes?! [changes channel to a boxing match on TV]
Announcer: And welcome back to Championship Boxing.
Squidward: [chuckles in hope] Heh-heh, I guess this is okay. I mean, it's not really about boxes. [two boxes go at each other in the ring] I give up.
Astronaut Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's Box: 3... 2... 1... blast off! [a loud rocket takes off noises are heard from the box]
Squidward: [fascinated] How are they doing that? That was the most realistic space launch I ever heard! There must be an explanation. Think, Squidward, think! [he imagines SpongeBob and Patrick are giggling so much]
SpongeBob: Shh! [he grabs a tape recorder to play music with real rocket sound effects] Squidward's such a jerk. [both laugh]
Squidward: Laugh at me, will they? [opens box once again] All right, where is it?
Patrick: [comes out of Squidward's green hat box] Here I am!
SpongeBob: Where's what, Squidward?
Squidward: Don't "Where's what, Squidward?" me! Where's the tape recorder?
SpongeBob: We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!
Squidward: Don't "We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!" me!
SpongeBob: But we don't!
Patrick: [holds up a small, white, rectangular box in his hand] We have a tape recorder box.
Squidward: [takes the small, white box from Patrick and throws it offscreen] All right, make way you two, I'm coming in. [gets into box]
SpongeBob: Welcome aboard, Squidward! You've just set sail on the S.S... [makes a rainbow with his hands once more] ...Imagination... where our only destination is fantastic adventure! Where do you want to go first?
Squidward: No, no. Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe.
SpongeBob: Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is about! It's about... [makes one last rainbow with his hands] ...imagination.
Squidward: All right, fine! [as he makes the rainbow go away with his hands] Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is! [SpongeBob and Patrick close their eyes and make pirate and robot sounds]
Patrick: [imitates robot] Beep-beep-beep.
SpongeBob: [imitates pirate] Arr.
Patrick: Beep-boop-bee-boop.
SpongeBob: Ahoy matey!
Patrick: Beep-beep.
SpongeBob: For that you'll walk the plank! [SpongeBob giggles softly, and Patrick starts chuckling goofily]
Squidward: [he gets angry. he growls] Why won't this thing turn on?! [he slams the bottom of the box with his fists] All right, fine. If you don't want to show me, [gets out of the box] I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing. [Squidward paces back and forth in his house] How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that! [he hears real robot/pirate battle noises from box] Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it: when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to! [he sits in his chair until nighttime]
[firework and cheering sounds are heard coming from the box. Patrick and SpongeBob come out of the box and Patrick yawns]
Patrick: I need sleep to refuel my imagination tanks!
SpongeBob: [Squidward looks out of his window] I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots.
Patrick: Yeah, see you in the morning.
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick. [they both go into their houses]
[Squidward sneaks out of his house. He tiptoes over to the box and gets inside]
Squidward: [He chuckles mischievously and then sees a piece of paper on the side of the box] Hello, what's this? [reads] "This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh! [tears paper into pieces with anger] I've got to find that button quick! [looks around the box] It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really was their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises? [pushes his foot down and the sound of an engine revving is heard] What the...? [Squidward turns the imaginary key] It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot! [laughs] Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had! [the noises actually come from a garbage truck, which lifts the box into the other garbage]
SpongeBob: [Squidward cheering in the distance while SpongeBob is reading a book in bed with his bed posts lit like candles] Listen to that, Gary. Squidward finally made the box work after all. That's so great.
Squidward: [the garbage truck begins to drive away with the box that Squidward is in] Vroom! Vroom! Only two more laps to the finish line! [the garbage truck dumps out the trash, including the box] I'm in the lead! Out of my way! I'm almost there! [laughs as the box slides down a trash pile] Whoo-hoo-hoo! Victory is mine! [the box hits something, sending Squidward tumbling down, face first onto a cherry pie. He groans and the box falls on him. The next morning, SpongeBob and Patrick come out of their houses]
SpongeBob: Hey, our box is gone!
Patrick: Oh, well.
SpongeBob: I know! Let's go see Squidward!
Patrick: I hope he's not too down in the dumps today. [he and SpongeBob walk to Squidward's house and a timpani noise is heard in the background as the screen fades to black]


SpongeBob: ♪Mop, mop, mop, mop, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping mopping!♪
Squidward: SpongeBob! [Frank comes in and brings him a dollar] Why don't you mop your way over the kitchen. [points at Frank] We need another Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Sure thing. [SpongeBob walks to make a Krabby Patty. He puts a patty in a half made Krabby Patty and he puts too much mustard on it. Mr. Krabs opens the hot shelter and smells he that he put on too much mustard]
Mr. Krabs: What's that?
SpongeBob: [puts on the last bun] Perfection. [Mr. Krabs walks to see SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: I don't think so. [grabs the Krabby Patty and sees too much mustard. Mr. Krabs gets angry at SpongeBob] You used too much mustard!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I...
Mr. Krabs: You obviously you didn't use your hydraulic mustard gauge. [Mr. Krabs uses a spoon and scoops some mustard. The spoon reads 101%. Mr Krabs gasps in shock] You think mustard grows from seeds? [throws the spoon and Krabby Patty away] Oh, at this rate, I'll be broke in [types the list] 411 years!
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: Your skills are rusty, you're not your usual sharp self! Did you have breakfast this morning?
SpongeBob: Yes, I had a cup of sea kelp and a Neptune muffin.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... well, what about sleep, young man? Did you get enough sleep?
SpongeBob: I did go to bed 2 minutes later than usual.
Mr. Krabs: [looks at SpongeBob] That's it! [pokes SpongeBob's body] You're an insomniac!
SpongeBob: An insomni-wha?
Mr. Krabs: You're a person who can't sleep and if you can't get enough sleep, your mind starts to go! [SpongeBob is surprised] Here. [Gives SpongeBob the spatula and pushes him to the grill] Come on, now, cook! [SpongeBob starts to flip patties. He pauses and glances at Mr. Krabs before flipping the patty. Mr. Krabs stops him] Ha! Ha ha! I knew it! You lifted a patty from one side, instead of straight up! What are you trying to do, sabotage me?! [takes the spatula and shoves him outside] Now you go home and get some rest!
SpongeBob: Oh, but, sir, I can't miss work at the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: Miss work? If you keep making mistakes like that, boyo, there will be no Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: No Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: That's right! [points at the road] Now, get!
SpongeBob: [walks down the road] Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Come back first thing tomorrow after a good night's sleep! [Cut to SpongeBob's pineapple]
SpongeBob: I just don't get it, Gary. I don't usually have a problem sleeping, do I?
Gary: [Chews his snail food]
SpongeBob: Well, I am not going to allow a mistake like today's to happen again. I am going straight to bed! [Cut to SpongeBob's bed.]
SpongeBob: This pillow is hard as a rock! What to do?
Gary: Meow meow meow meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary! Warm milk puts me right to sleep. [drinks it] Now, that should do the trick!
SpongeBob: [Milk pours out of SpongeBob's holes] Boy, it sure is quiet around here. Only 5 hours until I go to work. C'mon SpongeBob, you can do this. 4 hours 59 minutes 50 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 45 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds! [SpongeBob throws the clock away] What if I don't get to sleep at all? [in thoughts] Ohhh, Mr. Krabs was right! [Camera goes on SpongeBob's eyes] I am an insomniac. What am I gonna do? (speaking) I need some help. [SpongeBob runs to Patrick's] Patrick, Patrick, wake up. [SpongeBob pulls Patrick up]
Patrick: Uh-huh. [SpongeBob is speaking gibberish] Mmmm, sponge cake. [Chews on SpongeBob's hand]
SpongeBob: Oh, yuck! Never mind that, Patrick! I need your help, desperately! I'm a insomniac! I need to sleep!
Patrick: Say no more, buddy. I know just the thing! [Takes a deep breath, blows off the sand, and grabs a book] Get comfy!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! A bedtime story! [Pulls up the sand into a pillow and lays down]
Patrick: Okay. Once upon a time, there was a sleepy little boy.
SpongeBob: Ah, yay!
Patrick: The sleepy boy was the sleepiest boy in all the kingdom!
SpongeBob: Mm, sounds like me.
Patrick: One night, he nestled into bed for a long slumber.
SpongeBob: Slumber!
Patrick: And Sir Cecil, the sea sleep king, sprinkled him with mystical sleepy dust.
SpongeBob: Aw, thank you, Sir Cecil.
Patrick: He couldn't have been cozier. When, without warning, [raises voice] an excitable sea troll burst through the window. "Wakey-wakey, sleepy-doo!", he bellowed. Then suddenly he was whisked away by eagle-winged mollusks into the night sky!
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing? And what kind of a bedtime story was that, anyway?
Patrick: It's called The Land of Perpetual Excitement. You know, it's a "get out of bed" story!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep.
Patrick: Oh. [Throws the book on SpongeBob's nose] Right. Oh, I know! I'll sing you a lullaby from my childhood! "Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active, Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
SpongeBob: Um, Patrick, that's...
Patrick: Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, be active! Get up, be active!
SpongeBob: Patrick, this isn't...
Patrick: Get up, be active! Get up, be active! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
SpongeBob: That's a catchy bit...
Patrick: Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
SpongeBob: That's an excellent number, but...
Patrick: Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down! Get up, don't lie down!
SpongeBob: [yelling] Patrick! This isn't helping either!
Patrick: Well, what-what abou- well, I don't know what you want from me. It's not like I have a magic wand to wave. [Gets magic tools] Or do I?
SpongeBob: Oh, barnacles.
Patrick: Hocus pocus!
SpongeBob: Patrick, get serious, please!
Patrick: Abra zeptabra!
SpongeBob: I really appreciate your efforts, but I gotta try something else, buddy. 'Kay?
Patrick: SpongeBob, I see you're serious about this now. I didn't want to do this, but I'm gonna let you in on a little family secret. Old grandma suffered from severe toe barnacles.
SpongeBob: Blech!
Patrick: And she invented the secret elixir for just such an emergency. Drink up.
SpongeBob: Okay... Patrick, How is this gonna-
Patrick: Drink it!
SpongeBob: Hey, that wasn't too bad. What was it?
Patrick: Coffee.
SpongeBob: C-C-C-C-C-Coffee? Oh, for the last time, Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep!
Patrick: Oops.
SpongeBob: Uh-oh.. feeling jittery, heart p-p-pounding, teeth grinding... [Legs start to run by themselves] Uh-oh. [Starts to fly around and then breaks Patrick's rock] N-no! No, stop! We gotta get to sleep. Well, I guess I'll just have to let my legs tire out and catch up with my weary brain.
Sea troll: Wakey-wakey, sleepy-doo!
SpongeBob: Ahh! Sea troll! Huh? Just a shrub. Keep going till you crash SpongeBob.
Warm milk: SpongeBob, why did you drink me?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Warm Milk, you just tasted so good. [Shakes head] Shoo! That billboard is definitely not talking to you.
Warm Milk: Why, SpongeBob, why?
Mustard Krabs: Stop wasting all me mustard, boyo!
[SpongeBob notices a giant Mr. Krabs with mustard spouts for eye stalks and runs]
Mustard Krabs: Me profits! Me profits!
[The mustard gets in SpongeBob's way and he backs up and knocks over mustard barrels]
Squidwards: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Mr. Krabs is going to be upset! Ha, ha, ha, ha! [Drown SpongeBob in the mustard. An eagle-winged mollusk takes SpongeBob and takes him to a giant Patrick]
Patrick: Sponge cake!
[SpongeBob gets eaten by Patrick and breaks a bed when he lands]
SpongeBob: What's this? Another vision? [sees what looks like the sun starting to rise] Oh, why, why? Please, please, please let me sleep for just 5 minutes!
Sir Cecil: Do not despair, my child.
SpongeBob: Sir Cecil, the sea sleep king?
Sir Cecil: Just close your eyes and slumber. With some magic dust! [Picks up the dust and tosses it on SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hm... it's getting all sleepish around here. [Goes back into reality] Oh, thank you Sir Cecil. Hmm? Hey, looks like I finally got some shut-eye. Now to prepare for work. [Puts hat in a hole] Perfect. [Leaves] Bye, Gary. [Goes to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Boyo...? [Snaps his claw. SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hm?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Huh? Y-Yes... SpongeBob reporting for sleepy and tired.
Mr. Krabs: Ew! You're stinking like a swabby short pants after a clam dig! You sure you didn't forget something, boy?
SpongeBob: Forget..? Oh, right, right, Mr. Krabs. How could I be so forgetful?
Mr. Krabs: Heh, that's my boy. [Sees SpongeBob] What the barnacles?!
[SpongeBob washes his hands with the mustard dispenser]
SpongeBob: Employees must wash their hands before cooking. [He smears mustard on his face] Oh, that's nice...
Mr. Krabs: That ain't the sink, kiddo! [SpongeBob gets into the mustard barrel]
SpongeBob: I know, I know, I just need a quiet place... to nap.
Mr. Krabs: Me mustard! [Pulls SpongeBob out of the barrel] You didn't heed my words, did ya? You couldn't be bothered to get some shut eye, could ya?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs! I tried, I really tried! But my insomnia got the best of me! [SpongeBob starts to cry tears of mustard]
Mr. Krabs: Now he's crying away me mustard. That's enough boy! Me profits! [Mr. Krabs is surprised] Huh? Your crying the perfect amount! Hold it boyo, you're a natural born mustard dispenser!
SpongeBob: Is that a good thing?
Mr. Krabs: Dow, uh, nuh, Oh no, no boy. It's- It's terrible.
[SpongeBob cries again. Squidward overhears this]
Mr. Krabs: Just terrible!
Squidward: [smiling, leaning on his tentacle] Best day at work ever!


[The episode opens on a breaking news announcement on the television]
Johnny Elaine: Witnesses are flocking around the unveiling of Bikini Bottom's newest bank: The Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank.
Mayor: [cuts the ribbon] The first one hundred customers who join Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank will receive instant interest on their deposit.
[the view shifts to the Krusty Krab with Mr. Krabs spitting soda at the television screen]
Mr. Krabs: "Instant interest"?! Well, that's practically giving money away! [runs to SpongeBob] SpongeBob! You're in charge while I run down to the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank! I gotta get down there before they run out of dough! [runs very fast out of the Krusty Krab and into the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank] Money, here I co- Oo-oo-oh... [looks around at all of the customers getting their money out and starts speaking gibberish]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Thanks for banking with Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank! [takes out money] And here's your instant interest. [gives the customer money]
[Mr. Krabs continues to speak in gibberish as he watches Pilar throwing bags of into the safe]
Gus: Free moolah, just for joining?! Yes!
Mr. Krabs: I'm in money heaven! [laughs]
Officer John: [talking on a walkie-talkie] Heads up! We got a live one...
Nancy Suzy Fish: Welcome to Bank of Bikini...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, hi! I want to see all of your money!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Excuse me?
Mr. Krabs: Show me where the money lives! I'd bet you got a lot! [Nancy Suzy Fish presses a button] I'd like to see all of it! I'm a huge fan of money! [suddenly gets taken away by Nat Peterson and Officer John] Oh! H-Hey! Get your hands off... [gets kicked out of the Bank by Officer John and flies through the air] [screams and lands on the ground] Anchovies...
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs entering the Bank again but this time, wearing a mustache]
Mr. Krabs: [in a deep voice] Good day, madam! I would like to take a look at your safe, please!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Sure thing, sir... [presses the button again and Mr. Krabs is grabbed by Officer John and Nat again]
Mr. Krabs: Not again... [gets kicked out of the Bank again] [screams and crashes into a cliff] Scallops!
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs entering the Bank again disguised as a woman]
Mr. Krabs: [walks by Officer John and Nat Peterson, speaking in a feminine voice] Good day, gentlemen!
Officer John and Nat Peterson: Good day, ma'am!
Mr. Krabs: [walks up to Nancy Suzy Fish again] Hello, young missy!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Well hello, ma'am. How can we help you today?
Mr. Krabs: [in his thoughts] So far so good...
Nancy Suzy Fish: Ma'am?
Mr. Krabs: [in his thoughts] They haven't thrown me out yet...
Nancy Suzy Fish: Ma'am? [Reaches over to the button and is preparing to press it]
Mr. Krabs: [in his thoughts] It's all coming together now...
Nancy Suzy Fish: Can I help you, ma'am? A withdraw? A transfer? Anything!? Free interest!?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Oh-ho-oh yes! I'll have that please!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Okay, but you'll have to make a deposit first.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, of course! [takes out a penny] Here's me prized penny to deposit it into a new account!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Okay! I'll set it right up! [pulls out a drawer]
Mr. Krabs: [in his regular voice] Wait! [back in his feminine voice] Uh, what'cha doing? Penny doesn't want to be crammed in there with all those other coins. She wants a money condo of her own!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Okay. You want a safe deposit box then?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yes! Penny will have one of those!
Nancy Suzy Fish: Uh, this way please. [leads Mr. Krabs to a bunch other safe deposit boxes. She then is about to open one of the boxes to put his penny in]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Can i...have one moment with me penny? Alone?
Nancy Suzy Fish: [sighs] Make it quick. We're closing in five minutes. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, penny...I'm gonna miss ye...[sniffles and starts crying] It's inhuman I tell ya! Penny, penny...one last kiss goodbye. [gets into the safe deposit box and his female clothes falls to the ground. He goes back to using his regular voice.] It's just you and me now little penny! It's a wee bit cramped in here!
Nat Peterson: [walks by and notices the box open] Oh, well that looks secure...[closes the box and Mr. Krabs goes flying into the safe. Nat then locks the box] Were you people trained in a barn? [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: This can't be true! [picks up some money and starts to sniff them. He then actually sniffs off the hair on one of them] 'Tis true! I landed in money nirvan-er! [jumps up] Me wildest dreams finally come true! [laughs and lands in the pile of money. The scene changes over to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm done watering down the ketchup. Did you want me to...[looks and sees that Mr. Krabs isn't in his office] Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Would you pipe down!?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward! I can't find Mr. Krabs and he said he'd be right back! I'm getting a little concerned...
Squidward: That's nice...and...interesting...
SpongeBob: I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna go look for him! [runs out of the Krusty Krab] Hold on, Mr. Krabs! I'm coming for ya! [walks near a Bus Stop] Mr. Krabs! [walks through an open field] Mr. Krabs! [walks past the Hospital] Mr. Krabs! [walks by the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank] Mr. Krabs! [walks away and the scene changes back over to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Well, time to head home! [slides down a bunch of money] Whoo hoo! I hope to see each and every one of ya on the outside! [tries to climb up the hole and get out but the door is locked] Blimey, I'm locked in! [climbs back out the hole] I guess I'm trapped here all night! [jumps on a pile of money] With all of this moolah! So much moolah... [grabs a bill and blows on it] But no one to tell about it! Time to rustle up me some friends!
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' house]
SpongeBob: [knocks on the door until Pearl opens it] Oh, hi Pearl! Is Mr. Krabs here?
Pearl: No.
SpongeBob: Pearl, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Mr. Krabs is missing!
Pearl: [sarcastically] Oh my gosh.
SpongeBob: I know!
Pearl: Oh, my, gosh.
SpongeBob: Don't worry! I'll find him!
Pearl: [agitated] Oh my gosh! [hands SpongeBob her cell phone] Call him on his cell! [slams the door and the scene changes back over to the Bank]
Mr. Krabs: You look absolutely stunning tonight, Mrs. Greenback. Waiter! [snaps fingers] [speaks as waiter] Oui, oui, monsieur, what can I get you and zee lady tonight? [back to regular speaking] The lady would like to start with a million clams. A side of investments, and hold the taxes. I'll have the same. But with extra no taxes. [pushes the waiter out of view] Eh. Such a friendly fella. Good lookin' too. I'm almost gonna regret not leavin' him a tip. [cell phone rings] Hello?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? Are you okay?
Mr. Krabs: I'm fine boy! In fact, I'm dancing with a beautiful lady.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's nice.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, and she's made entirely out of money.
SpongeBob: What? Where are you?
Mr. Krabs: I'm locked in the bank vault, and having the time of me life. Oh, and I think I'm running out of oxygen, and it's making me lose my mind.
SpongeBob: I gotta save Mr. Krabs! [runs to Patrick's house] Patrick! Patrick, you gotta help me, buddy! I need to break into a bank! [Patrick stops drinking his water, and spits it back on SpongeBob]
Patrick: What?! SpongeBob SquarePants, we have been friends for a long time, and you've asked me to do some crazy things over the years. But breaking into a bank? [SpongeBob looks ashamed] Has to be the coolest!
Mr. Krabs: [at the bank] Ah. This is the life. [imagines a beach] Sun, sand, and surf. And of course. Mrs. Greenback by my side. What's that? Ah, don't start on me now. I'm sure this remote island has a food source! Krabs just hasn't found it yet, that's all. I'll just… eh, Heh eh-heh. So hungry.
SpongeBob: [outside the bank] Coast is clear! What's the plan, buddy?
Patrick: Okay. First we climb up the walls. [points up] Then, we slide down the chimney and eat up all the milk and cookies they left out for us!
SpongeBob: Well, I don't see a chimney. But we could try getting in through a roof vent. If only we had a way to scale this wall.
Patrick: Luckily, I brought the bank breaking kit! Uh. How about this? [holds out several shoelaces]
SpongeBob: A bunch of old shoelaces?
Patrick: It's as close as I'll ever get to having shoes.
SpongeBob: I wish we had something stronger. But this'll have to do. [throws shoelaces up, they catch a pipe, and hold. The shoelaces continue to untie, and SpongeBob jumps to catch each one]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! I got an idea! Let's use this grappling hook! [throws the grappling hook up, it catches. SpongeBob climbs up, while Patrick piggybacks. They tiptoe across the roof]
SpongeBob: This vent will surely lead us straight to Mr. Krabs!
Patrick: Let's get him! [the two jump into the vent, and bump all around the bank, then underground, and then through another building. They land on the ground in front of the bank.] Cool! Let's do that again!
SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick. We're running out of time. And more importantly, Mr. Krabs is running out of oxygen.
Mr. Krabs: [inside the imaginary island, it's on fire] Ohhh! So hungry! [stomach growls] Oh, why did I come to this uninhabit-abl-able island? Why did I do it? What! Huh, why did I say all that to Mrs. Greenback? I miss her… why isn't she? Mrs. Greenback! Where could she be? What have I done? [sees Greenback on the beach] Ah! Ms. Greenback! Oh, Ms. Greenback. [picks her up] You're okay! I was so worried. [mumbles, and rubs Greenback] I'm so sorry, you must never run away like that again. [As he rubs, all the money composing Mrs. Greenback flies away] What's this?! Ah! Little miss! What the Neptune?! [sees money dragon] A slimy money dragon! You're not sucking away me fortune without a fight! [attacks, and comes back to the real vault, shows he is attacking a a vacuum cleaner] Give me back Mrs. Greenback you beast!
SpongeBob: [outside the front doors to the bank] Patrick, you ready?
Patrick: This lock won't know what hit it! [sticks screwdriver into the lock]
SpongeBob: Ah, careful Patrick. Use finesse.
Patrick: Oh, right! [pulls out a crowbar] I'll use the finesse. [swings, and SpongeBob ducks. Closed signs switches to open, and they fall through the doors to the foot of the bank manager and night switches to day]
Bank Manager: Good morning, gentlemen. [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
Patrick: We've been rumbled! Run! Scatter! Scamper! Save yourself!
Bank Manager: What's all this about? [walks backwards to alarm button, SpongeBob pulls off ski mask.] May I help you with anything, sir?
SpongeBob: Ah. Yes, I need to make a withdrawal. I need to withdraw one Mr. Krabs!
Bank Manager: I assure you, Mr. SquarePants, we've received no such deposit. [opens vault]
Mr. Krabs: I've gotcha now, money sucker! That does it, Lizard-breath! It's you or me, now! Just you and me! [wrestles the vacuum, and breaks it. Laughs evilly] Ooh! I conquered the money dragon! Victory! Woo!
Bank Manager: Security! [security throws them out] And don't forget your… eh… deposit. [tosses penny at Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: You know, boyo. Through this whole ordeal, I've learned a little something about greed. A little something about isolation. Heh. Even a little something about love. And you know what I realized through it all?
SpongeBob: That you can't put a price on freedom?
Mr. Krabs: Barnacles no, boy! I realized that they didn't pay interest on me deposit! [shakes fist] Hey, you cheapskates! Give me me interest! [penny is thrown at Mr. Krabs] Well. What do you know? I doubled me money. [laughs as the episode ends]


[A mail truck drives through the mountain range. Patchy the Pirate is driving the truck. He appears to be parodying S.D. Kluger from the song "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town."]
Patchy: Merry Christmas, kids! I bet you're wondering why ol' Patchy has this mail truck. Well, this year, I wanted to be absolutely sure Santa got me letter. So I gave Mr. Mailman the day off.
[He puts his pirate hat on the mailman tied up and gagged in the back of the truck, puts on his mailman hat and closes the door]
Potty: Do you even know how to get to the North Pole?
Patchy: Oh, Potty, you silly parrot. Everyone knows that the directions to the North Pole are in the lyrics of the song "Jingle Bells." ♪Dashing through the snow, in a... [Mumbles] Through the fields we go. La la la la la.♪ Okay. So we're looking for some fields here.
Potty: No, Patchy, the directions to the North Pole are in the song, "There Goes Santa Claus." ♪There goes Santa Claus. There goes Santa Claus. Left on Santa Claus Drive.♪ Scurvy brain.
Patchy: Yeah, well, we ain't turnin' till we see some fields.
Potty: Look out! There's a fork in the road!
Patchy: I don't see no fork.
[The truck spins after the fork gets caught in the wheel and they both scream.]
Patchy: While we wait for the truck to stop spinning, let's see what SpongeBob is up to this Christmas.
[The camera zooms in on Bikini Bottom and into SpongeBob's pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are sleeping. SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off and sleigh bells are heard instead of the foghorn noise. SpongeBob wakes up.]
SpongeBob: ♪Oh, it's drawing very near. My favorite time of the year. [He jumps out of bed and up the ladder] The snow is falling and the cold wind blows. [He gets up on the diving board, and jumps on it] Christmas is almost here. [He jumps up, automatically removing his pajamas and changing into his square pants] And I know that Santa, Santa. Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! [He spins Christmas lights around his pineapple] It keeps me warm and filled with glee to know Santa has his eyes on me. I light my house like a Christmas tree. Fa la la la la la la la lee. 'cause Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little... [A Santa hat pops out of SpongeBob's head] Eyes on me.♪
[He walks over to Squidward's house where Squidward is putting up lights]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! What are you doing today?
Squidward: Stringing lights so Santa knows, in no uncertain terms... [Turns the lights on] ...to go away!
SpongeBob: Okay... [Skips up to Patrick next to a box on a stick tied with string to a cookie] ♪Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me. He sees everything I do, with his left eye on me and his right eye on you!♪ [sees the box] Ooh, what's that?
Patrick: It's a trap! A trap for Santa!
SpongeBob: Ooh. Baited with Christmas treats?
Patrick: [in the tune of "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"] ♪I will trap Santa in my box, locked up like Fort Knox and make him stop the clocks. And we'll have Christmas all year long!♪ Hey, a cookie! [Patrick goes for the cookie and the box traps him.]
SpongeBob: ♪Ohh... Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me! Fa la la la la la la la la lee! [sees Sandy's treedome] And who is that I see? Underneath her Christmas tree?♪
Sandy: ♪Oh, Christmas, oh, Christmas is sweet mystery. I'll mix a dash of Christmas cheer with a candy cane and deconstructed alchemy.♪
SpongeBob: Merry Christmas, Sandy!
Sandy: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob skips to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: ♪Santa, Santa, Santa has his jolly little eyes on me.♪ Hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready for Christmas?
Mr. Krabs: Why, Christmas is me favorite time of the year! After all, 'tis the season of gettin'!
SpongeBob: Don't you mean the season of giving?
Mr. Krabs: Exactly! The more you give, the more I get. [Laughs]
Plankton: ♪Oh, Santa, Santa, Santa has his eye on me. He's seen everything I've done. Every plot, plan, and scheme. It's just a bit of fun. Santa has his eye on me. Every naughty deed is written in his scroll. So every Christmas morning, I get a stocking full of coal!♪ [Dumps out coal from his stocking]
Karen: Maybe you'd get a real present from Santa if you weren't the biggest jerk in Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: I'm way ahead of you, Karen! [Periodic Table lowers from ceiling. Plankton walks over to it and sticks a piece of notepad paper on it. The paper says Jt for Jerktonium] There is one element in the known universe that can turn even the nicest sap into the biggest jerk they can be! And I, Plankton have discovered it. Behold! [Plankton pulls a lever] Jerktonium! [A piece of Jerktonium contained in a glass capsule lowers from the ceiling] I'll give everyone in Bikini Bottom a present of the most innocent of all holiday goodies. The fruitcake! And each and every slice will be laced with Jerktonium! Once ingested, no one can help becoming the biggest, creepiest, meanest jerk ever! Then Santa will realize that Sheldon J. Plankton isn't so bad after all! And then I'll finally get what I really want for Christmas, the Krabby Patty secret formula! [Plankton jumps on an oven and holds the fruitcake] And now for the main ingredient, Jerktonium! Okay, Jerktonium, do your stuff! It's complete! [Laughs] Ha ha! The Jerkmaker 9000 will make doling out tainted fruitcake a breeze! Now, who's gonna be my first victim?
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton! What've you got there? [Gasps] Hey! Is that a fruitcake dispenser? You don't suppose I could have a piece, do ya?
Plankton: Sure thing, fruitcake! Here you go! [Presses button on the dispenser as a robotic arm gives SpongeBob a fruitcake!]
Plankton: Hot from the oven and full in lovin'!
SpongeBob: Ooh! Ooh! Hot! Hot! Hot! [Sighs as he takes a bite] Wow! This is great!
Plankton: So, how do you feel, kinda cranky?
SpongeBob: No.
Plankton: Sorta surly?
SpongeBob: Mm-mm.
Plankton: Maybe just a little bit jerky?
SpongeBob: No. I feel just how this cake tastes! Absolutely delicious!
Plankton: Hmm... He must have gotten a piece without Jerktonium! Here. Try some more.
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do! [He eats the fruitcake]
Plankton: How's your dander? Is it up?
SpongeBob: No. How could I possibly be angry when my taste buds are swimming in Christmas cheer? [He takes another piece; cut to inside of his mouth]
Taste Bud: Oh, boy, here comes some more! Yaaaay!
Plankton: Grrr! Have some more! [He fires a piece into SpongeBob's mouth] Have a whole loaf! [The arm stuffs a loaf into SpongeBob's mouth] Have a baker's dozen! [He fires many fruitcakes into SpongeBob's mouth] Well?
SpongeBob: Well... [He swallows] I think everyone should taste your amazing fruitcake!
Plankton: You know what? Knock yourself out. [He throws SpongeBob the keys to the dispenser] Stupid hunk of junk-tonium! My gift to Bikini Bottom. Boy, oh, boy. [He goes back into the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: [Rides the dispenser up to 3 carolers] Hello, fellow revelers! Would you like a Christmas treat?
Bill: Why, sure, SpongeBob!
Fish 2: Yeah, who doesn't like treats?
SpongeBob: [Dives into the dispenser and emerges with a plate of fruitcake] Nothing loosens up the old pipes like some fruitcake. Dig in!
[They all take a piece]
Fish 2: It's like a present for my mouth!
SpongeBob: I knew you'd like it.
Bill: [Grows bushy eyebrows, bags under his eyes, and five-o'clock shadow] Hey! Did we come here to sing or eat fancy cake?
Fish 2: Whoa, calm down, Bill! What do you want to sing?
Bill: Well, I want to sing the only Christmas song that matters, and that's “Jingle Bells”. From the top! A one and a two and a –
Fish 3: [Turns into a jerk] No, hold your holly! We're singing the best Christmas song ever, and that's “Silver Bells”!
Bill: Wrong bells, buddy!
Fish 2: [Turns into a jerk] Hey, I want to sing “Randolph the Red-Nosed Seahorse”!
[They all continue to argue]
SpongeBob: [Driving away, unaware that they have been poisoned with Jerktonium] Great to see people so passionate about the holidays.
Plankton: [Emerges from the Chum Bucket on a unicycle] What's all the racket? What do you know? The Jerktonium seems to work on these jerks. Very interesting.
[Cut to a shot of a Christmas parade in town]
SpongeBob: Oh boy, a Christmas parade! The perfect occasion to spread some mouthwatering joy. [Singing] Oh, everyone, try some hot fruitcake today. Eat it all up and you will shout “Hooray!”!
Bikini Bottomites: Yay!
SpongeBob: Everyone can get behind a mouthful of warm sunshine, everyone eat a Christmas time cliché. [People start turning into jerks. Somebody pops a kid's balloon. Another person smashes a gift over somebody's head. Pearl squirts water at passers by] Everyone can get behind a mouthful of Christmas time, let's all eat some hot fruitcake today!
Plankton: [Cycling through the rioting town] This just keeps getting better and better.
Costumed Santa: [On a float, with a boy on his knee] Ho ho ho! So, little boy, what would you like for Christmas?
Boy: I want a sled and a truck and a bike and a train ...
SpongeBob: Hi, Santa! Have some fruitcake. [He throws a piece]
Boy: And a water pistol and a helicopter and – and, uh ...
Costumed Santa: [Turns into a jerk] Well, why don't you get a job and buy all that junk yourself? And while you're at it try brushing your teeth, you little -
SpongeBob: Have some fruitcake! [Hands a piece to the float driver]
Driver: Thanks! [He turns into a jerk, which shocks him in surprise] That's it! I'm outta here! [He panickedly leaves the float and it crashes off the end of a cliff]
Boy: [Bouncing on the Costumed Santa's belly] Whee-ee-ee! Oh, yeah. And I want a trampoline!
Plankton: Success! Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks! Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy.
[Cut to Plankton's lab]
Karen: Once again your master plan is fatally flawed. [She brings up a diagram] It seems that SpongeBob's innocent love of the holidays shields his heart from the effects of Jerktonium.
SpongeBob Diagram: Dahahaha! That tickles.
Plankton: Drat! That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off! I guess it's time to introduce Plan B. [He pulls a lever and a giant SpongeBob robot drops from the ceiling] Hahahahaha! Plan B, meet Karen. Now go, my automated agent of naughtiness, go and destroy SpongeBob's good name! [He laughs evilly but nothing happens] Huh? Oh yeah. [He winds up a key in its back]
ToyBob: I am ready, I am ready, I am ready. Ready to destroy Christmas. [Flames shoot from his nose. He leaves the Chum Bucket and destroys a car, then heads for the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: What's goin' on out here? Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. [ToyBob burns the Krusty Krab sign, which collapses on Mr Krabs]
Plankton: Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy!
[The mail truck is still spinning out of control and finally comes to rest. The bound and gagged mailman escapes and jumps away]
Patchy: I can't believe we survived that horrifying car accident without a scratch. [He gets out of the truck and slips on the ice] Ow! [He notices the fork in the tire] Aw, here's the problem. Oh, that's not good. Flat tire, huh? Looks as sad as an empty bag of beef. Brrr! It's cold up here. Why don't you kids at home go make a nice hot cup of cocoa while Potty builds me a fire?
[End of part one; now to part two with a scene of Potty and Patchy huddled around a fire]
Patchy: [Shivering] Hello, kiddies. It's so cold, me eye patch cracked. There hasn't been any food or water or food or food for over 20 minutes. [Coughs] Boy, I could sure go for some buffalo wings right about now. Sounds good. Eh, Potty? [Patchy looks at Potty and imagines him turning into a plate of buffalo wings] With a side of blue cheese dressing. [He grabs a fork, licks his lips, and lunges at Potty who flies up. Patchy bites on the log Potty was sitting on]
Potty: Squawk! What are you doing?
Patchy: I'm sorry, Potty, I don't know what got into me. I'm just so hungry!
Potty: It's okay, Patchy, I can't stay mad at you.
Patchy: Aww. [Potty imagines Patchy's head turning into a suet cake]
Patchy: Why are you looking at me like that, bird? [Potty pecks at his head] What are you doing?
[Cut to SpongeBob's storyline; SpongeBob is riding the dispenser through Bikini Bottom and comes across the three carolers he first gave Plankton's fruitcake to]
SpongeBob: Merry Christmas, fellas!
Bill: Ah, go stuff a stocking!
SpongeBob: Gee. That wasn't very nice. [He drives past Mr. Krabs, who is mending the Krusty Krab sign] Seasons greetings, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Will you get some nerve, SpongeBob! This is comin' outta yer salary!
SpongeBob: What's that all about? [He drives up to Patrick, who is setting another trap] Hey, Patrick! What're you up to?
Patrick: I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob! [He eats a slice of fruitcake] I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now.
SpongeBob: Yeesh, okay. Don't have to be a jerk about it. Everybody's on edge today. Must be the holiday jitters.
Patrick: Nosybody. [He falls into his own trap] Yay, it works! Oh. Hello, big, striped shrimp. [He screams as it attacks him]
[The next morning, SpongeBob steps outside]
SpongeBob: Ah, Christmas Eve! When all of Bikini Bottom is filled with good will.
Johnny: Merry Christmas, Frankie.
Frankie: Merry Christmas to you, too, Johnny. [Throws a snowball in Johnny's face]
SpongeBob: More like bad will! Gosh, if people don't start acting nicer, Santa's going to fly right past Bikini Bottom this Christmas Eve! I'm gonna need some help. [He knocks on Squidward's door] Squidward!
Squidward: [From inside] I'm not home!
SpongeBob: Oh gosh, what do I do now?
Squidward: Why don't you go bother Sandy?
SpongeBob: Good idea, Squidward. I'll have to thank you when you get home. [He leaves, and ToyBob walks up to Squidward's house, pounding on the door]
Squidward: I said I'm not home! [ToyBob wrenches the door off its hinges] SpongeBob, give me back my door! [ToyBob smashes it over Squidward's head]
[Cut to Sandy's treedome]
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy! I need your help! It's Christmas Eve and everyone in Bikini Bottom are acting like jerks! You gotta help me find out why.
Sandy: [Turns around and bares her teeth, scaring SpongeBob, showing that she's become a jerk] Why should I help all them jerks?
SpongeBob: Because those jerks don't care about Christmas any more, Sandy! It's a problem.
Sandy: Problem? My only problem is I'm out of fruitcake. Only thing I've got left to eat are boring old nuts. [She throws one at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, the problem isn't the fruitcake! The problem is that everyone, including you, is acting like a jerk! Oh, I'll have to solve this on my own. [He turns to leave and slips on a nut, accidentally throwing the fruitcake into Sandy's Christmas analyzer] Whoa!
Sandy: Dagnabbit, SpongeBob, you got fruitcake in my Christmas magic analyzer! [An alarm sounds] Well, I'll be hornswaggled. My analyzer's found something in the fruitcake! [She looks at the reading and gasps] This is terrible!
SpongeBob: What is it, Sandy?
Sandy: The fruitcake is contaminated with Jerktonium! No wonder I've been as ornery as a sidewinder on a hot driveway. Jerktonium is the orneriest element of them all and your fruitcake is full of it. Where'd you get that fruitcake, anyway?
SpongeBob: From Plankton, he baked it.
Sandy: You took food from Plankton and fed it to everyone in town?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Sandy: You're an idiot.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Sandy: No wonder everyone in town is a big old meanie.
SpongeBob: Oh! I've eaten tons of that fruitcake! I must be the biggest jerk in town!
Sandy: [Pokes him] Hmm … You don't act jerky. For some reason, it's not affecting you. [She puts a scanner in front of him] It must be a combination of your tiny brain and pure heart. You're immune to Jerktonium, SpongeBob, but the rest of us will need an antidote. I'll set the analyzer to calculate the formula. [She pulls a switch and a music score pops out] Why, this formula for the antidote don't make no sense at all!
SpongeBob: Hmm… That's no formula! It's a song! [He hums it, and Sandy becomes her normal self] Sandy, The song is the antidote!
[Cut to downtown Bikini Bottom, where people are still rioting]
Fish 6: Oh yeah? Well your fins are fat!
SpongeBob: Ahoy, everybody!
[He clicks his fingers and mistletoe appears over the heads of the two fish he fed Plankton's fruitcake to, curing them of Jerktonium poisoning. He clicks again and a pile of presents appears, curing two other fish. A little boy begins to play Christmas baubles like bells]
SpongeBob: ♪Bring joy to the world, it's the thing to do, but the world does not revolve around you. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! [Throws a snowball at Mr Krabs and cures him] Be nice to babies and animals, old folks, too. 'Cause that's how you'd like them to treat you! Use turn signals. Don't screen my calls. Don't you wreck the house when you deck the halls. Spit your gum where it won't wind up on my shoe. Squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube. Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas! It's Christmas![Hands a gift to Pearl, who continues to pass it down a line, curing people as they receive it, except for Squidward, who is unaffected] When others are talking, never interrupt. Don't put people down or leave the toilet seat up. It's the time for families and holly and turkey. 'Tis the season to be jolly, not jerky!♪
SpongeBob's Friends and Co.: [in background chorus' voices] ♪Jolly, not jerky!♪
SpongeBob: ♪Santa brought nearly every gift on your list. Why whine about the one that he missed? Don't be a jerk, it's Christmas! It's Christmas! Don't be a jerk. It's Christmas!♪
Sandy: Congratulations, SpongeBob, your song worked!
SpongeBob: And not a moment too soon. Santa should be here any minute.
Mr. Krabs: You ain't kiddin'. Here he comes now!
[They all clear the way as Santa Claus' sleigh and reindeer land in front of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Santa! You made it!
Santa: Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho! Cool your jets there, son. I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad tidings.
SpongeBob: Oh, no!
Santa: Oh, yes. It seems you're all on my naughty list this year.
SpongeBob: Naughty list?!
Santa: No buts about it. You've all been a bunch of jerks.
SpongeBob: But---!
Santa: But nothing. Coal for everyone! Except Plankton.
SpongeBob, Friends and Co.: Wha-a-at!
Santa: I'm just as surprised as you, but compared to the rest of you, he's been a saint.  [Hands him the Krabby Patty formula] Here you go, Sheldon, I believe this is what you asked for.
Mr. Krabs: Me secret formula? How did you get that?
Santa: I have my ways.
[An elf reaches into Mr Krabs' pocket and takes his wallet]
Pearl: Um... Dad?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Slaps the elf] Get out of me pocket, ya foul goblin!
SpongeBob: But- but- but- but- but- but---! [Patrick slaps him] But, Santa, you've got it all wrong!
Santa: On the contrary, SpongeBob, you're the worst of all. There you go, right now—wreaking havoc!
[The crowd parts and reveals the rampaging ToyBob]
Plankton: Uh-oh.
ToyBob: [Focuses on SpongeBob, Plankton and Santa] I am ready to destroy Christmas. [transforms into his mega mode] Destroy Santa.
SpongeBob: If you want Santa, you gotta get through me!
Mega ToyBob: Okey-dokey. [Karate chops SpongeBob]
Santa: Oh, my.
SpongeBob: Is that all you got?
[Mega ToyBob picks him up and flings him far away and releases a flame]
Santa: I'm outta here. [He hides in the Krusty Krab, but ToyBob finds him and picks him up] You do realize this counts as, naughty.
SpongeBob: You put that jolly elf down, you big tin imposter! [Fires fruitcake at Mega ToyBob] Hot from the oven, full of lovin'! [Rushes back to rescue Santa] Hurry up, Santa, hop on!
[Mega ToyBob shorts out and explodes]
Santa: Thanks again for saving my keister.
SpongeBob: Oh, it was nothing.
Santa: You're clearly a very good lad, unlike the owner of that wind-up monstrosity. [An elf hands him the wind-up key] What have we got there? "If found, please return to the Chum Bucket"? Plankton?!
Plankton: Uh-oh.
Mr. Krabs: Hand it over, Sheldon. Don't make it any worse. [Takes the Krabby Patty formula. Plankton gets flung at Santa's sleigh, and he splatters all over it. He falls off, leaving squish marks on the sleigh]
Santa: O.K., boys, let's give Plankton what he deserves. [The elves pour coal onto Plankton] So long, kiddies! Ho-o-o-o, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! [He flies away as everyone [except Squidward] waves goodbye to him]
SpongeBob: Hey, has anyone seen Patrick?
Patrick: [Hiding on Santa's sleigh]  Hee hee hee hee. I gotcha! [Catches Santa in a net, sending the sleigh off course]
[Potty is still pecking Patchy's head]
Patchy: [Notices a sign] Santa's workshop? I'm here, Santa! I'm here!
Potty: I'm not going in there.
Patchy: Santa! [He sits on Santa's lap and pulls out his letter] There's only thing I wants for Christmas! And it's to meet me hero, SpongeBob SquarePants. [Santa sprinkles magic dust on Patchy to make his wish come true, then the illusion breaks and Patchy realizes he's in a cave with a polar bear who sprinkled him with salt because he wants to eat him. The bear chases him. The scene then cuts to Potty standing next to Santa]
Santa: I think stealing a mail truck definitely counts as naughty. Wouldn't you say, Potty?
Potty: I sure would, Santa.
[They laugh]
Both: Merry Christmas.


[A jellyfish flies in the sky.]
French Narrator: Ahh, another beautiful day in Bikini Bottom's own Jellyfish Fields. An untamed world of natural order where the little jellyfish jellies roam free across the salty seascape. And where there is jellyfish, there is the Jellyfish Hunter.
SpongeBob: La la la la, la la la la la! [SpongeBob catches it] You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you "Twelvey." [tickles it with a feather] Coochie coochie coo! [it sneezes out some jelly] Bye, Twelvey! [Twelvey stings him as it says goodbye and flies away. He sees a blue jellyfish] Oh! It's you! [He mimics the jellyfish's style of floating, then tries to catch the blue jellyfish, but fails] Well, it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name.
No Name: [buzzes] [caption reads: "Bring it on!"]
SpongeBob:  [yells battle cries and tries to catch it. He runs. He steps on a soda can. He then runs so fast he flies like a rocket] Gotcha! [he is unsuccessful at catching it] ...Barnacles, how'd he do that? Someday, I'll catch old No Name.
[cut to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You've got 5 minutes!
SpongeBob: Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch! [he imitates a rocket launching and lifts his bag into the air] [a jar of jelly and a Krabby Patty fall out of the bag. He puts the jelly on the Krabby Patty and starts eating it.] Yum! [makes sounds, moans]
Fred: [Looks behind and stares at SpongeBob in confusion.] Hey, buddy! What the heck is that?
SpongeBob: Why, this is a hole, good sir. You see, I am a sponge, And we typically...
Fred: Not that! [points to SpongeBob's jelly patty] That!
SpongeBob: It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly.
Fred: Could I try some?
SpongeBob: Sure! [gives Fred some jellyfish jelly into his Krabby Patty]
Fred: [Eats the Krabby Patty with jellyfish jelly] Amazing... I've got to tell someone about this! ♪Hey all you people! Hey all you people! Hey all you people, won't you listen to meeeeeee... I just had a sandwich, no ordinary sandwich, a sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly! Hey, man, you've got to try this sandwich, it's no ordinary sandwich, it's the tastiest sandwich in the sea. Ah de ba da ba doo ba da ba de ba da da. Yeahhhhh... [The other Krusty Krab customers applaud him.] Thank you!♪
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?
SpongeBob: No one, Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers. [Showing some fish eating jelly patties happily. Shows love hearts and extremely satisfied customers.] Here you go, Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey.
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs the patty suspiciously] Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!
Fred: Sir, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten! I'm going to come back here for lunch everyday for the rest of my life! [A bill with Fred appears in it] Hey, buddy, you alright?
Mr. Krabs: [speechless, mutters incoherently]
SpongeBob: You okay, Mr. K?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!
Mr. Krabs: Well, keep dreaming. [Mr. Krabs gives him a jellyfish net] This'll be on your time.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Krabs: Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it [SpongeBob holds up a jellyfish in a jar] ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish.
SpongeBob: But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers. [Mr Krabs starts dramatizing depressing emotions] Oh, no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!
SpongeBob:  [gasps] No! Never!
Mr. Krabs: [optimistically] Then go out there and get me some more jellies!
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs:  [sinisterly, to himself] Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet! [chuckles]
SpongeBob: [jellyfishing with many nets. He then shows up with three jars] Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [painting a sign saying "Home of the Jelly Patty"] I'm gonna need more than that, boy.
SpongeBob: [cuts a rope. Many jellyfish are inside it. He shows up with five jars] More jellies, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [painting jellyfish on the walls of the Krusty Krab with the words "I Love Jellyfish" on his shirt] Oh, that'll never do. More!
[SpongeBob has a mustache on. A sign next to a jellyfish hive reading "FOR RENT" is shown. Jellyfish come in. They are trapped in a large net]
Mr. Krabs: [customers are lined up] More, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob is driving a large replica of himself. Its hand shows up at the Krusty Krab with a jar full of jellyfish]
Mr. Krabs: What don't you understand about... more?!
[Many SpongeBobs catch jellyfish]
Mr. Krabs: More! [SpongeBob catches two jellyfish with a net] More! [SpongeBob catches a jellyfish with a jar] More! [SpongeBob catches some jellyfish with a net while jumping leftwards to the screen] More! [SpongeBob tries to catch some jellyfish with a net by jumping rightwards to the screen] More... [SpongeBob manages to catch some more jellyfish with a net by jumping leftwards to the screen. Mr. Krabs now appears as a hideous caricature, popularly known as "Moar Krabs."] MOAR. [SpongeBob's catching goes wildly fast. Mr. Krabs now appears normal, but continually appearing] MOAR, MOAR, MOAR, MOAR. MOAR, MOAR. MOAR! [Cut to night. A sign reading "Jellyfish Fields. Pop. 0" is seen. "4 Million" is crossed out]
SpongeBob: Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!
[No Name secretly follows him]
SpongeBob: It feels like somebody... WANTS TO SELL ME SOMETHING! [Turns around and sees nobody]
Businessman: [hiding behind rock with another businessman] I told you he was on to us.
SpongeBob: [running away] I'm not interested in anything you're selling! [opens the door to his house and gets in as he looks out the window] I sure felt like... [laughs] I must be working too hard. [telephone rings] I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?
No Name: [breathing]
SpongeBob: [laughing nervously] Wrong number. [No Name has pliers and cuts the living room fuse and the lights go out. SpongeBob laughs nervously] I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill! [door opens and a small, black figure comes in] Gary, is that you? Gary? [the figure goes inside the kitchen] Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen. [light shines on a Krabby Patty with blue jellyfish jelly] Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly. [gasps] Blue jelly?! [No Name shows up] Hey, old No Name? What's happening?
No Name: [buzzing, shows a net and jar]
SpongeBob: [inside the jar] No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business? [No Name shows a factory] Hey, I don't remember that factory! [No Name shows him the inside] Huh? [Jellyfish are inside tubes. They are being sucked of their jelly. The dried out ones are put in trash cans. SpongeBob gasps] What is this horrible place? [a robot is tickling a jellyfish]
Robot: Coochie coochie coo. [jellyfish sneezes the jelly out and dries up]
SpongeBob: What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?
[Mr. Krabs is riding on an exercycle. It turns out that he's the monster who's responsible for this when SpongeBob caught the jellyfish of the fields]
Mr. Krabs: That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do?
[Mr. Krabs is shown wearing headphones and listening to an upbeat pop tune] 
Singer in the recording: ♪Give it all you got! Dance, dance, dance, get on it! Take it to the top...♪
SpongeBob: [breaks in, riding on No Name] Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!
Mr. Krabs: Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! A tea party! [No Name taps him] You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!
Mr. Krabs: Easy, boy, what are you doing with that?
SpongeBob: [holding an alligator wrench]  Something that should've been done a LONG TIME AGO!
Mr. Krabs: NOO!
SpongeBob: The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!
Mr. Krabs: [relieved] Whew!
SpongeBob: And now, I'm gonna set these jellyfish free! [tries to open it, but is unsuccessful]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say "open"! [Mr. Krabs realizes what he just said, and he covers his mouth, but it's too late. The sign on the door lights the words "OPEN" and the jellyfish escape.]
SpongeBob: Freedom! FREEDOM!!!
Mr. Krabs: YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME!!!! [He tries to pedal away as he laughs madly, then he looks down.] What?!
[Mr. Krabs sees that pedaling away didn't work, meaning that the excercycle never left the floor, and it remained intact on the floor, namely that an exercycle is meant for working out on it. The scene cuts to the jellyfish just right behind him, hovering over Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Blasted exercise craze...
[The jellyfish sting Mr. Krabs and he screams in pain. The jellyfish escape out the doors, possibly back to Jellyfish Fields.]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, friends!
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the factory and is incredibly burned] I'm taking jelly off the menu. [leaves]
SpongeBob: He really got burned on that deal! [laughs] All is as it should be. [brings out his jellyfish net] I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever! [No Name floats in SpongeBob's net. He gasps] Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... "Friend." [reaches his arm out. No Name does, but accidentally stings SpongeBob. He nervously smiles]


[SpongeBob is lurking around, heading home, looking for Sandy because they are playing karate. He suspects the pineapple of being Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! Oh, sorry, pineapple house. I thought you were someone else. [walks inside] Ah, what a great day at work. [hears something] Huh? Yeah... [tip toes over to the couch, but makes duck sounds as he tip toes. He realizes he's been stepping on three squeaky toy ducks, and in frustration, he kicks them away. Then he runs in front of his couch] I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge... [jumps behind the couch and no one is there] ...Bob. [has his back to the couch while he squeezes his eyes through the couch looking for Sandy. When he thinks he has spotted her, he runs out from behind the couch and in front of the TV] I got you now! Hi-yah! [no one is there, so he sits on the couch and watches TV] Well, I guess the coast is clear.
TV: [shows a royal gramma fish] Yeah, shopping's weird. Did you ever go into the seafood aisle and say “Who eats this stuff"? [TV audience and SpongeBob laugh]
SpongeBob: I love this show! [Sandy is sitting next to SpongeBob]
Sandy: Me too! [SpongeBob screams and begins to fight]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [Sandy puts on her green karate gear]
Sandy: Hi-yah! [SpongeBob high-kicks in slow-motion]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [Sandy runs off then drives forward, but SpongeBob jumps his upper half of his body to avoid Sandy] Uhh, just a second. [runs off, but returns with his red karate gear on] Safety first! [he winks] And now, spin technique! [spins around and lunges towards Sandy]
Sandy: Hi-yah! Yah. [SpongeBob grabs her hand and spins her around]
SpongeBob: Double overhand squirrel knot! [turns her into a round knot and throws her through the door like a bowling ball]
Sandy: I'm gonna get you tomorrow, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: That'll be the day. [spins his arms and legs around. Pans over to nighttime at Sandy's treedome, when the phone rings]
Sandy: Hello? [SpongeBob's arm tries to karate chop Sandy, but Sandy takes SpongeBob's hand and puts it through the phone to karate chop himself] Nice try, SpongeBrain! [hangs up phone. Later, at Barg’N’Mart, Sandy is shopping when a box of Kelpo falls. She thinks it's SpongeBob, so she gets in her karate stance] Yah! [notices the box of Kelpo] Heh, silly me. [But when she walks a few more steps, SpongeBob is there in his karate gear]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?
Sandy: I don't think so.
SpongeBob: Well, it goes like this! [stretches his arm to ricochet off a shelf and the ceiling to come at Sandy] Oh, wait, I forgot the punch line. [His arm stops right before hitting Sandy] Oh, yeah! [hits the loose board on the floor, sending Sandy into a pile of tin cans] That's a good one, isn't it? [later, SpongeBob is walking down the road] What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful... [sees a pile of tin cans on the ground] pile of cans? Mmm, mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet. [He puts on karate gear]
Sandy: No it's not, SpongeBob. [shows him a squirrel mask] This is! [jumps in front of SpongeBob] Now, prepare for a long, merciless whooping! [grabs SpongeBob's tongue and takes out a bottle of hot sauce] Mmmm, my favorite.
[SpongeBob whimpers in fear as a drop of hot sauce hangs over the edge of the bottle and Tom Kenny's face appears on the drop]
Volcano Sauce Drop: Eheheheheheh! [cut to SpongeBob's confused face, and then back to the Volcano Sauce Drop] By the powers of naughtiness, I command this particular drop of hot sauce to be really... really... hot!
[SpongeBob gasps.]
SpongeBob: Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours.
Sandy: I knew you'd come to your senses, SpongeBob.
[Sandy drinks the bottle of hot sauce. While she is doing this, SpongeBob takes out his tongue revealing a label that says "Novelty Toy" and he wraps the fake tongue she was holding around her and spins her]
SpongeBob: Yah.
[Sandy karate chops SpongeBob far away]
Sandy: Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Curses! [Now at the Krusty Krab, the line is very long]
Customer: With extra cheese. To go!
Squidward: Three patties, four large oyster skins, on the double, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is still wearing his karate gear]
SpongeBob: Oh yeah. Gotcha! [SpongeBob opens a door]
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What? [karate chops Squidward's face]
Squidward: I'm going to pretend that didn't happen. [throws two pieces of paper at SpongeBob] Now fill these orders or leave, SpongeBob. We're very busy today! [SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen with tray of patties in his hands]
SpongeBob: Order up. [stops as he sees a customer karate chopping a fly. The customer turns into Sandy who is in her gear and winks at SpongeBob]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Now are you gonna... [SpongeBob throws the tray backwards at Squidward, causing the Krabby Patties to land on Squidward's head]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward. I was going through some records back in me office and--Huh? So, you got the hairpiece after all.
SpongeBob: Hi-yah!
Fred: [under the floor] My leg!
SpongeBob: Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! ‘Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this! [does something with his hands] Ssss! [Points at Fred, then walks backwards] Took care of her, yes I did. [bumps into Mr. Krabs] Oh, ahoy, sir!
Mr. Krabs: What was that?
SpongeBob: But, sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo.
Mr. Krabs: Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?
SpongeBob: No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it.
Mr. Krabs: Kara-tay? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward. [he walks off. Later, at closing time, Squidward is mopping the floor]
Squidward: SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet? [SpongeBob is staring at his hands]
SpongeBob: Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah!
Squidward: [frustrated] Go!
[SpongeBob walks into the bathroom with a mop and a bucket in his hands. He hears a sneeze, so he opens a door, but nobody is there]
SpongeBob: Hah! [opens the next stall door and jumps in it] Sandy! [Mr. Krabs walks out of the stall with SpongeBob in his hand]
Mr. Krabs: No more.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs grabs a hold of SpongeBob's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Shh! No more of this karate stuff, lad. Or you're fired. [lets go of his mouth and walks away]
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Fired? [walks out] No more karate? How am I gonna tell Sandy?
Sandy: Hi-yah! [jumps at SpongeBob and starts karate chopping him]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate.
Sandy: [stops] Uh-huh. Sure, SpongeBob. [Sandy karate chops him again]
SpongeBob: No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop.
Sandy: [stops] I'm not falling for it, SpongeBob! [karate chops him even more]
SpongeBob: No, really! Please, stop! [Mr. Krabs looks out the window]
Mr. Krabs: What the? [walks outside] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams]
SpongeBob: Ahh, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What did I just get through telling ye, lad?
SpongeBob: But I, uhh, she...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're fired!
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Fired? [his face gets smaller until it's not there anymore]
Mr. Krabs: Eh?
Sandy: SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's face reappears and he then bursts out crying and runs everywhere] Wait, Mr. Krabs, it's not his fault! It's- it's mine! He tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen! [SpongeBob is crying into a cup and drinking his tears. Now he's flipping over and over around Sandy and Mr. Krabs] Give him another chance, please?
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm. [grabs SpongeBob as he runs] Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind. [sniffs Sandy] Mmm, mammals. [walks off]
Sandy: Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing. [she and SpongeBob sigh] Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about [karate chops SpongeBob] this?
SpongeBob: [laughs, then suddenly stops] Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!
Sandy: We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.
SpongeBob: We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh. [picks up a rock] We can squeeze things! [squeezes the rock and drops it] Woo! How much fun was that?
Sandy: Almost some.
SpongeBob: I know! We can act like plants. [lies on the ground and opens and closes his legs and arms] Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.
Sandy: Wanna go to the park? [SpongeBob and Sandy are at the park. SpongeBob is holding a basket in one hand]
SpongeBob: Karate sure is dumb.
Sandy: Yeah, you can say that again.
SpongeBob: I feel dumb just thinking about it. [puts the basket down] Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!
Sandy: You like what?
SpongeBob: Not karate.
Sandy: Ha! I don't even know what that is.
SpongeBob: Me, too. I don't know what anything is! In fact...
Fisherman: [casting off his fishing rod] Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: [giggles] For a second, that sounded like.
Sandy: Karate?
SpongeBob: Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate? [opens up the basket] Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?
Sandy: Karate.
SpongeBob: What did you say?
Sandy: Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich. [takes out some mustard] There we go. [SpongeBob pulls out some barnacle loaf]
SpongeBob: How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?
Sandy: One. Just one.
SpongeBob: One for you! [karate chops a slice off]
Sandy: Hmmm?
SpongeBob: And one for me! [chops off another slice in slow-motion]
Sandy: Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hmm?
Sandy: Maybe just one more. Uhh, I'm kinda hungry.
[SpongeBob brings out the barnacle loaf again]
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Sandy. [lifts up his hand]
Sandy: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Sandy: Do you think, umm, do you think I could cut this one?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sure.
Sandy: Thanks. Hi-yah! [chops one slice] Is that enough?
SpongeBob: Maybe just one more. Or two!
Sandy: Or three!
SpongeBob: Or ten!
Sandy: Ten! Yes, ten! Because we're really hungry!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right! [chops off more slices and they fly everywhere]
SpongeBob: Time for buns! [throws a bunch of buns in the air and chops them in half]
Sandy: How about some tomatoes?
SpongeBob: And I'll cut the cheese! [both throw the cheese and tomatoes in the air while chopping them into a bunch of slices that land on the patties]
Sandy: And, what else should we slice? [SpongeBob grabs more buns]
SpongeBob: More buns!
Sandy: [Sandy grabs two heads of lettuce] And lettuce!
Both: Yeah! [both slice up more food to complete their Krabby Patties and one of the buns lands on an earthworm]
SpongeBob: Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy? [Sandy has a dazed look on her face] Right? I guess I'll eat one now. [reaches for a patty, but Sandy karate chops his arm with her green foam hand]
Sandy: You're mince meat!
SpongeBob: [in his red karate gear] In your dreams! Hi-yah! [both start to karate chop each other. Later, Mr. Krabs is walking through the park, carrying an umbrella]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? What the barnacle? [Everything in the park is chopped in half. Sandy is chopping wood while SpongeBob rests on a rock]
SpongeBob: Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate?
Mr. Krabs: [clearing his throat to get SpongeBob's attention]  Bleuhahugh!
SpongeBob: [screams] Mr. Krabs! [tries to hold a tree back in one piece] Uhh, hey, Mr. Krabs, how’s it going? [holds the rock in one piece] Nice day, huh? [half of the tree falls on SpongeBob's head] Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.
Mr. Krabs: Fire ya? [grabs a couple Krabby Patties] I've got something else in mind. [at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Sandy are karate chopping up Krabby Patties for the customers. Sandy is chopping up the meat and SpongeBob is chopping up the mustard]
Sandy: I love karate!
SpongeBob: I love kara-tay!
Mr. Krabs: I love money-ay! [He holds some money]
Squidward: I hate all of you.


SpongeBob: [squeezes some shell wax onto Gary's shell] All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob grabs his nose and uses his back to wax Gary's shell]
SpongeBob: Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood. [opens Gary's shell and jumps in] Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Still? From New Year's Eve? [Gary blows his horn. SpongeBob sees something in his shell] What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary. [laughs] My favorite novelty t-shirt! [holds up a shirt that says I &lt;3 Krabby Patties. Doorbell rings] Oh, someone's here. [jumps out of Gary's shell]
Mailman: Special delivery for SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special? [hugs the mailman]
Mailman: Alright, do we have to go through this every time I give you your mail? Sheesh. [leaves]
SpongeBob: What could it be today, Gary?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [opens package] A videotape? [reads it] "You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants! [inserts videotape into VCR. Videotape plays]
Announcer: Karate Island: A serene and exotic location where nature and beauty abound, and hundreds of fighting styles collide in a wave of non-stop, pulsating, no-hold barred action! For centuries, the world's top karate artists have journeyed to this land to be crowned King of Karate.
SpongeBob: King of Karate?
Announcer: Now it's your turn...
Announcer 2: ...SpongeBob SquarePants.
Announcer: You've won an all-expense paid trip to Karate Island! Hi-yah! Where you'll be crowned this year's King of Karate!
SpongeBob: Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned... [shouts karate yells] King of Karate! [jumps to the door, leaving his arm in the ground] Whoo-hoo! [shouts karate yells]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.
Sandy: Karate Island? I've never heard of Karate Island.
SpongeBob: Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.
Sandy: But, my karate is better than yours by a country mile, and I've never been invited.
SpongeBob: Maybe your karate was the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.
Sandy: There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along with you and see if it's on the up-and-up.
SpongeBob: All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment. [laughs. Scene cuts to both in a boat heading towards Karate Island] Are we there yet?
Sandy: Yup. That's it over there.
SpongeBob: What make you think that's Karate Island? [big sign that says "Welcome to Karate Island" is pointing at the island]
Sandy: I don't know -- lucky guess? [three fish are waiting on top of some rocks for SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Sandy arrive on the island]
SpongeBob: Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.
Fish: Welcome to my island, SpongeBob-san. [bows]
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you. [bows]
Master Udon: I am Master Udon.
Sandy: Howdy, Master Udon, I'm Sandy Cheeks. I do a little karate, myself.
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty.
Sandy: Oh, brother.
Master Udon: Please, show me some of your moves, Master SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You hear that, Sandy? He called me "master." Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em. [three fighters appear]
Sandy: SpongeBob, your karate's not good enough to handle those sidewinders.
SpongeBob: Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister. [shouts karate yells at the first fighter. He falls to the ground] Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?
Sandy: Something smells like rancid rodeo around here. [all the fighters are knocked out]
Master Udon: Excellent. Truly, you are King of Karate.
SpongeBob: The one and only.
Master Udon: We must make ready for your coronation.
SpongeBob: I'm ready to be King of Karate! [gong sounds]
Master Udon: King of Karate-san, it is time for you to take your rightful place on your throne.
SpongeBob: My throne. [floats over to the throne]
Sandy: All right, Udon, I'm on to you. This place is as crooked as a dizzy sidewinder.
SpongeBob: [sitting on his throne] Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement. [claps twice] Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend. [chair is brought]
Sandy: SpongeBob, y'all are getting a bit wily.
SpongeBob: Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?
Sandy: Heck, I could karate you into a country fiddle with one paw tied behind my back.
SpongeBob: [laughs] But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.
Sandy: I'm getting off this crazy train! [mumbles]
Master Udon: Master, don't worry about her. She is missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime. [laughs] Let the coronation begin!
SpongeBob: Sandy's going to miss out, big time. [suddenly SpongeBob is chained down to the throne. Master Udon reaches into his robe and takes out a pen]
Sandy: That dang SpongeBob. Who does he think he is? I taught that yellow egomaniac everything he knows about fighting -- and that ain't much.
SpongeBob: No!
Sandy: SpongeBob's in trouble! [SpongeBob screams] SpongeBob is the "King of Karate". He doesn't need me. Eh, he can handle this himself.
SpongeBob: [in the distance] Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself.
Sandy: Hold on, buddy! [enters a building where Master Udon is watching from above]
SpongeBob: No, Sandy!
Master Udon: She will never reach you. She must first pass through the 'Four Floors of Fear'.
Sandy: [enters first room] SpongeBob?
The Tickler: Ha. Ha-ha-ha. You cannot pass unless you defeat me, The Tickler, and my iron-finger style. [both get ready then attack] Ha-ha. Look!
Sandy: Huh? [laughs as she is being tickled]
The Tickler: Prepare for the tickling of your life!
Sandy: Taste these! [has a plate full of jelly-filled donuts]
The Tickler: Oh no! Jelly-filled donuts? How did you know they were my weakness?
Sandy: No one can resist jelly-filled. [throws the donuts into The Tickler's mouth] Sticky around, I'll be back with the glazed.
The Tickler: I could use a wet napkin.
Sandy: [enters floor two] All right, who's next?
Lip Service: Halt! No one advances past me, Lip Service, and my power-flexi dynamo-lip thruster style. [attacks Sandy]
Lip Service: Dance, squirrel, dance. [her lips send Sandy backwards]
Sandy: Advanced hair-dryer style!
Lip Service: [laughs] What do you expect to do with that? [Sandy uses the hair-dryer to blow air on Lip Service’s lips, making them chapped] Oh, no! Not chapped lips! [takes out some lip balm. Applies some, but it breaks her lips]
Sandy: That's enough lip out of you. [enters third floor, but slips on her way in, because it's covered in mud. She slides into a big green Jabba The Hutt look-alike]
Filthy Phil: No one has ever made it to the lair of Filthy Phil. No one passes except me. Now, feel the steam of my horrible body odor. [strains to get body odor out. The body odor tries to get into Sandy's helmet, but can't]
Sandy: Ha-ha, Phil! Your foul stench can't permeate my fresh-air dome.
Filthy Phil: Fresh-air dome? [inhales his own body odor] Man, I really do stink. [passes out. Sandy breaks through some boards to enter floor four where Master Udon is]
Master Udon: You are one impressive squirrel. You even made a costume change.
Sandy: Release SpongeBob!
Master Udon: Never. [as Sandy is going to attack, she is trapped in a bird cage. She strains to break through, but she can't] He is forbidden to leave until...he signs this contract.
Sandy: What are you talking about?
Master Udon: Real estate.
Sandy: You mean this whole thing was a scam to get us to buy real estate?
Master Udon: Yes. If there was a real Karate Island, I'd be a millionaire.
SpongeBob: You mean I'm not King of Karate?
Master Udon: No. But you could be King of Condos. Here, let me explain. It's really quite simple. [pulls down chart] See, if you invest in a time share here on Condo Island, you can see your equity increase ten-fold. Perhaps you and your yellow friend would like to set up a timeshare plan?
SpongeBob: Don't do it, Sandy! [Sandy chants something]
Sandy: [breaks the bird cage] I won't give in to your timeshare vacation scam!
Master Udon: Then give into my fists. [rips off robe and exposes his speedo and to show a more buff Master Udon. Sandy does the same by ripping off her jumpsuit then exposing her bikini to reveal a buff Sandy. Both flex their bodies, starting with the extra muscles like Sandy’s Tail along with Master Udon’s Eyebrows next The Chests,Arms,Legs and they both do primal roars,then fight.They miss each other from Charging.Master Udon turns back to get her. Sandy jumps on top of Master Udon's head, then slaps him with her feet. Master Udon then grabs Sandy by her ankles then spins her around and throws her into the wall. Sandy retaliates by springing of the wall and landing in front of Master Udon They karate chop some more before Sandy grabs him and throws him on the ground over and over. She then throws him in the air and kicks him in the face, sending him outside of the tower and falling into the ocean]
Sandy: You're in the soup now, Udon! [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy walking toward their boat]
SpongeBob: Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from... [swallows hard] buying a condo.
Sandy: Aw, shucks, SpongeBob, that's what friends are for.
SpongeBob: I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?
Sandy: You are in my book, SpongeBob. You are in my book. Now let me tell you about real estate. It's all about location... [boat drives off as another boat, carrying Squidward, arrives]
Squidward: I'm here! The King of Clarinets has arrived! [Master Udon is waiting on top of the rocks again]
[scene cuts to black, then fades to dedication of Pat Morita (1932 - 2005)]


SpongeBob: [At SpongeBob's House, SpongeBob is chopping a smaller pineapple in half] HIYA! HIYA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! Ta-daa! A gift, in your likeness. [hands Gary the pineapple which looks like him]
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: ‘Cause you're so sweet... Get it?! 'Cause pineapples are sweet, and you are sweet also as well. Get it?! [laughs, Gary leaves, SpongeBob continues laughing until a fly from the gift flies into his mouth, SpongeBob chokes]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. You still got that bucket of cheese? [SpongeBob tries heimliching himself, Patrick realizes SpongeBob's choking] Oh no! He's... not right! Don't worry, pal! I'll help you! [Patrick punches SpongeBob and the fly comes out]
Patrick: Buddy! You okay?
SpongeBob: Ahhh. Patrick, Thank you so much! If it weren't for your tremendous gorilla strength, I would've been a goner! If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises. [gets a watermelon] Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again, buddy. HIYA! [chops the watermelon]
Patrick: [gets the cheese bucket and eats some] [SpongeBob continues chopping items] Hey! I want to learn how to do that. [points to chopped up bread]
SpongeBob:  What, what, you mean karate?
Patrick: Uh-huh!
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to...
Patrick: If I recall correctly, I seem to remember saving your life a few minutes ago.
SpongeBob: Yeah... However...
Patrick: I also remember you saying, "If there's anything you can do to return the favor, anything at all... to let you know.
SpongeBob: Well, I did say that, Patrick, but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface. [Patrick runs over]
Patrick: Then teach me.
SpongeBob: As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility.
Patrick: Oh yeah! Mama! [cuts to training]
SpongeBob: Okay. Let's start off simple. This is a basic move called "the inverted whirlpool".
Patrick: Inverty whirpey... Got it! [SpongeBob lays on head and twists feet, he starts moving and blasts through the objects]
Patrick: Woohoo! That was awesome!
SpongeBob: Think you can handle that?
Patrick: Yeah! Yeah! [does the same thing as SpongeBob] Ha Ha Ha Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah! [continues laughing] Hey, how do you stop this thing? [heads towards lemonade stand]
Harold: Neptune's trousers! What's that?! [screams and runs away. Patrick destroys lemonade stand; cuts to next stage of training]
SpongeBob: Now, this is very easy, watch closely. [Does a move] Haa-haah. You got it?
Patrick: Definitely! [Patrick does the same but spins out of control, SpongeBob stops him and he falls]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable. [walks away]
Patrick: What?! I...! [gets mad and chops through cinder blocks] Barnacles!
SpongeBob: [looks in amazement] Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No one's ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through solid cinder!
Patrick: Wow!
SpongeBob: You're a natural! A karate genius!
Patrick: Clamo!
SpongeBob: [holds a sword] Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- [Patrick cuts it in half]. Wow. Amazing! [cuts to an old abandoned ship]
SpongeBob: This is an abandoned, broad-ironed steamboat, solid as a rock. Think you got what it takes? [Patrick misses]
SpongeBob: Ahhh... better luck next time. [the boat breaks]
Patrick: Yeah! I bet I can chop anything! [goes over to Sadie and Baby Rechid]
Sadie: AAAAAHHHH!
Patrick: HIIIII-
SpongeBob: [stops Patrick] Noooooo! What did I tell you?!
Patrick: I'm a genius?
SpongeBob: Not that! [pulls out a tape recorder] ...this. [SpongeBob's voice on recorder]: With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?
Patrick: Yesss...
SpongeBob: Good! [his watch beeps] Oh man, I'm late for work. [runs] See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said.
Patrick: Okay! I'm a genius! [cuts to Patrick's rock]
Patrick: [chops hot dogs] Karate power! [eats part of the hot dog, cuts to Patrick at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [looking at magazine] What's this? Hhmmm... haven't seen this before.
SpongeBob: Hey, look, it's Patrick!
Patrick: Hi-yah, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What are you doing... [Patrick chops the door]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Dear Neptune!
Patrick: Good day, gents! Ahhh, Squidward, I would like a HIYAAA!
Squidward: A... What?
Patrick: I said one Krusty Combo. Don't you speak karate?
Squidward: [sighs]
Patrick: [chops the meal in half] Looks delish.
SpongeBob: Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice a bit too far?
Patrick: I don't know what you're talking about. You're the one who called me a karate genius. And, frankly, I'm offended by your previous accusation. I don't need this! I beg you good due.
SpongeBob: But, but, but-
Patrick: No buts! Just hands. [chops door again]
SpongeBob: Oooohhh!
Mr. Krabs: You do realize I'm taking that out of your pay check.
[cuts to Patrick at the ice cream shop]
Patrick: Uuuuuhhhhh... Seaweed Surprise! Also!... uuuuuuhhhhh... Malted Coral Crunch! [ice cream is really tall] Oooh... Ooh, also, Lipids and Creme!
Lou: We're all out. In fact, we're out of everything, which means you owe us $86.50
Patrick: What do you say to a trade? [pulls out a disgusting lollipop]
Lou: I say, pay up before I call the cops.
Patrick: You dare refuse my barter?!?! Then accept my chop! [chops tip jar and ice cream flies into Patrick's mouth, he eats it and becomes fat. He becomes frozen, chops out of the ice and rubs his tummy] Ahhh... I don't feel so good.
Billy: Aha! Hand in the tip jar again, eh! [Patrick is stuck in door and chops it open]
Patrick: [sniffs] What is that wonderful stench? [walks to Harold Fish] Whatcha got there?
Harold: Spinach and chocolate spaghetti in calamari sauce. You wanna bite?
Patrick: [chops the food] NO! It's more fun to chop! Hahahahahahaha! [cuts to Bikini Bottom Arcade, Patrick chops a game]
Patrick: I win, I win, I win! [cuts to Krusty Krab]
Patrick: HIYAA HIYAA-
Lifeguard fish: Help! Help! There's a mad chopper on the loose!
SpongeBob: Mad chopper?! Patrick!
Lifeguard fish: We need the cops, kid!
SpongeBob: Cops? No, that won't be necessary. I'll handle this, citizen.
Lifeguard fish: Don't do it kid. [grabs his ankle]
SpongeBob: Unhand my ankle, sir, my friend needs me.
Lifeguard fish: You don't know what you're doing. Don't walk out that door! NOOOOO! [SpongeBob on his unicycle, Patrick chops a car]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: SpongeBob, just the man I was looking for. I wanted to thank you, buddy. [chops his unicycle]
SpongeBob: For what?
Patrick: For teaching me how to karate chop, silly.
SpongeBob: You gotta stop, buddy, you're destroying the entire town!
Patrick: [looks at the destruction] Wooooooooooo.
SpongeBob: Just stop chopping, okay, Patrick?
Patrick: You got it, buddy. No more karate chops! [chops a jail truck]
SpongeBob: You're still chopping!
Patrick: I know! Weird, huh?
SpongeBob: Patrick, stop it!
Patrick: Oh. Okay. I know, I'll stop a chop, with a chop! [Patrick chops his hand and it hits his face]
SpongeBob: [grabs Patrick's arm] You must resist! [flings SpongeBob on a fire hydrant] AHHHHHAAHH! [Patrick's hand pulls him away and his hand chops Squidward's hedge sculpture]
SpongeBob: Wait up, Patrick! [gasps] Triton's tunic!
Fish [off-screen]: He's headed straight for the Barg'N-Mart!
[Everyone screams and runs away]
Patrick: [in the store] HIYA YA! Oh, no! Not the muffin display... YAAAAH! [chops it]
News Reporter: This just in, a mad man is chopping everything.
Patrick: Not the giant-screen TVs! [chops it] Oh no!
News Reporter: The suspect is considered fat, pink, and dangerous.
Patrick: Oh, oh! Gianter TVs! HIYAAA! [chops one and falls]
SpongeBob: Pull it together, buddy!
Patrick: I'm trying to, but this thing has a mind of its owwwnnnn... [punches SpongeBob, SpongeBob hits a rack] YAAAAAA! [then the counter, until the whole store collapses. He emerges from the rubble.]
Patrick:  SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [spots a kitchen sponge] Oh, no! I'm so sorry, my best friend, crushed by all this rubble, entombed in this cheap, plastic bag. [cries and hugs it]
Dennis: [Emerges from the debris] That isn't your friend, you kelp-for-brains. Those are cleaning sponges.
Patrick: [Looks at the pack closer and throws it away, becomes relieved] So I haven't crushed the life of my best friend in the world?
Dennis: Ummmm...I wouldn't say that. [Points him to rubble covering SpongeBob]
Patrick: [sees the pile of rubble] SpongeBob! Oh no! [pushes rubble off SpongeBob and gasps] Ohhh, I'll never forgive myself [cries] No! I'll never forgive you! [points to his and, pulls it off]
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Oh, hi, Patrick. What did I miss?
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're okay!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Your arm!
Patrick: Ha! Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm a sea star. My limbs grow back. See?
SpongeBob: Hooray for regeneration!
Patrick: And in the spirit of healing, I vow to use my hands only to join things together, starting here! [rebuilds the Barg'N Mart]
SpongeBob: Hey, great job, Patrick! I like the architectural details.
Patrick #2: HIYAAA! [chops shopping cart]
SpongeBob: Patrick! I thought you gave up chopping!
Patrick: Oh, I did. Unfortunately, we sea stars have limbs that grow new bodies.
Patrick #2: HIYYAA! [Barg'N Mart collapses again]


[The episode starts in the Chum Bucket where Karen drops chum from a paper bag]
Karen: Another bag of chum... [smells it] Bleh, now to shape this into his Highness' dinner request. [Karen's screen shows a drink, pizza, a hamburger and pie, then releases a laser from her head and shoots it to the chum pile and the chum becomes a drink, a pie, and more chum; delivers it to Plankton.]
Plankton: [using welding tool on circuit board] Almost done.
Karen: [gives Plankton the food] Here you go. Eat up.
Plankton: What's this supposed to be?
Karen: Chum seaweed, chum pot pie, chum con coral, and chum tea. Also known as dinner.
Plankton: Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again. I did not request chum pot pie. I requested chum stir fry.
Karen: Well, I told you months ago that my memory is full but you've been too busy with your latest project. So tell me, Plankton, how do you plan on failing to steal the Krabby Patty formula this time?
Plankton: Computer wife, don't start with me! This plan is foolproof I tell you, foolproof! [laughs evilly and picks up circuit] Not only will I soon grasp the formula, but I'll get rid of your bad memory as well. [places circuit board into motherboard of the same size and shape and presses button on motherboard] [the outer core of the button begins to transition from left to right as if identifying the percentage of time left for the robot to start up]
[A robot screen turns around and points towards Plankton]
Plankton: Karen, I want you to meet my new computer wife!
[Screen lights up and then straightens out to a red line matching the original Karen's]
Plankton: Karen 2!
Karen: [gasps] Karen 2?! I've been...replaced?!
Plankton: I'm afraid so. But can you blame me? She's got triple the processing, all the latest software, and a sleek space-age design. [chuckles] The whole package!
Karen: I can't believe this! And after all I've done for you! You dumped me for this cheap pile of plastic?!
Plankton: Well, I had to cut cost somewhere.
Karen 2.0: Who are you calling cheap?! At least I don't rust!
Karen: You know, you're going to wish that you'd deleted that comment!
Plankton: Hey, come on, babe. Don't take it so hard. You'll find love again. Maybe you'll meet a nice...uh...adding machine.
Karen: Oh that does it! [Karen's screen shows "Loading: Jealousy Scheduler; the screen has a bar that indicates the amount of percentage it has loaded]
Plankton: Oh, why did I program her with a jealousy scheduler.
[When the scheduler becomes fully loaded, a laser ejects from Karen's head]
Plankton: And why did I outfit her with a molecular re-arranger ray?
[Karen's screen then shows a picture of a pie and then a stir fry. She aims the laser at Plankton.]
Karen: Here's your stir fry, little man!
[She blasts the ray at Plankton, but he evades it.]
Plankton: Uh, uh. Let's not do something we might regret! [He runs the other way until Karen appears in front of him]
Karen: You should know regret's the one thing you left out of my operating system! [Karen charges up her molecular rearranging ray preparing to zap Plankton, but then Karen shuts down.]
Plankton: Huh, what happened?
Karen 2.0: I accessed the Chum Bucket's power grid, remotely cutting off Karen's power at the source.
Plankton: Ha! Karen 2, I knew you were special the moment I laid eye on your motherboard! Goodbye, Karen Classic, [leaps onto Karen 2.0] hello, Karen 2! [He then laughs maniacally and the camera zooms out to the Chum Bucket at night. It pans over to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are outside.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, the end of another lucrative work day, SpongeBob. [He takes out his key and locks the doors to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [in a depressed tone] Yes, the end. [filling with tears] Quitting time is almost too much to bear.
Mr. Krabs: Seriously, son, you gotta lighten up. Well, good night, kiddo. [He walks away]
SpongeBob: Good night, sir. [catches up to Mr. Krabs] See ya tomorrow.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet.
SpongeBob: Catcha later, so long. Bye Bye [Mr. Krabs narrows his eyes in annoyance as they pass the Chum Bucket.] Toodaloo! Whoa! [SpongeBob trips over something. The camera then zooms out to reveal that SpongeBob tripped over a box with Karen's body inside it.]
Mr. Krabs: Phew, would be the first I've been saved by a pile of trash. [continues to walk away]
[SpongeBob gets himself out of the box and looks at it]
SpongeBob: This isn't a pile of trash. [picks up Karen's head] It's a free computer system.
Mr. Krabs: [zooms back and taking Karen's head] Free! Now what kind of barnacle would throw out a perfectly good computer?
SpongeBob: Judging from our location, I'd say Plankton.
Mr. Krabs: Huh. He always has been a knucklehead.
SpongeBob: Could this be one of Plankton's elaborate ruses?
Mr. Krabs: Perhaps. But who could pass up a free computer? [packs Karen's head in the box and brings it in the Krusty Krab] Let's plug her in, see what she can do.
[The scene bubbles over to Mr. Krabs' office. Mr, Krabs turns on Karen's monitor. Then Karen's screen shows Loading]
Mr. Krabs: She's loading up. Now let's see how this dial up thingy works. [places the telephone receiver on top of Karen and her screen shows an hourglass turning.] This thing does text mails right?
SpongeBob: Yeah, I think so.
[Karen's screen shows the words Karen Classic with her picture on it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that sounds promising.
[Karen starts crying on her screen and scaring Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Our computer's suppose to emote? No need to cry, little lady.
Karen: Don't tell me not to cry! [continues crying and scaring Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob again.]
Mr. Krabs: She's malfunctioning!
SpongeBob: Must be the dial-up thingy!
Mr. Krabs: You're right, must be interfering with her circuitry! [grabs the telephone and throws it against the wall destroying it in the process]
Karen: Oh it's not the dial-up thingy. It's Plankton, he dumped me for a newer piece of hardware. [continues crying]
Mr. Krabs: Help me out here, buddy. [pushes SpongeBob next to Karen]
SpongeBob: Hey, there. Dry those computer tears. I'm sure you two will get back together. Plankton just need some time to realize how much he needs you. I mean, you guys were made for each other. Well, you were made more for him and more specifically by him, and now, he's built someone with more modern features who's better in every way. There's no- what was my point again?
Karen: [sobs] You men are all alike! [hops off Mr. Krabs' desk and onto her mobile body. She hops out of the box and then rolls out of the office.]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Where ya goin’? Smooth, SpongeBob, real smooth. [comes out of his office and sees Karen looking outside the window] Let's talk this out.
SpongeBob: Careful, Mr. Krabs. This still could be a ruse. Karen's loyalty maybe still be with Plankton.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what part of "free computer" are you not understanding?
[Cuts back to the scene where Karen is looking at the Chum Bucket through the Krusty Krab windows. Plankton's laughter is heard. The scene then shows one of the Chum Bucket door entrance window and we can see silhouettes of Plankton and Karen 2.0 having a romantic dinner with each other]
Plankton: Tonight, we celebrate, and tomorrow, the secret formula. [He continues laughing and the scene pans back to Karen looking out from the Krusty Krab window]
Karen: I don't ever want to see that low life again as long as I live. Goodbye, you miserable little bug! [Karen's screen shows a mouse picking up a Plankton icon and placing it in the recycling bin.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, in the case, welcome aboard! [puts a Krusty Krew hat on Karen's head]
SpongeBob: All right!
Mr. Krabs: Yeehaw! [They give each other high fives while Karen shows an annoyed face on her screen]
[Bubble transitions to morning where we see Squidward going inside the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Huh? [he stops and sees Karen at the cash register]
Karen: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
Squidward: My order?
Mr. Krabs: I see Squidward must not have gotten the last company text mail. Karen will be taking over your duties from now on, Mr. Squidward. She's efficient and more importantly: I don't have to pay her.
Squidward: So, I'm fired? No more taking orders? [more happily] No more interacting with customers? No more SpongeBob?! I'm free! Ha Ha! I'm free! [cheering] Whoo.
Mr. Krabs: Not so fast, Mr. Squidward.
[Bubble transitions over to Squidward in the bathroom holding a mop. It turns out that Mr. Krabs had given him bathroom duty. Squidward sighs in disappointment. The scene then cuts to three fish in line waiting to take their order.]
Ivy (gray): Hi there, can I get a Krabby Patty and a side of coral bits please?
Karen: You'll get your Krabby Patty when I'm good and ready! [she turns to SpongeBob] Sorry, I'm just... [sniffs] ...going through a lot emotionally, right now.
SpongeBob: Well, you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling down?
Karen: You defragment your hard drive?
SpongeBob: No, putting in a hard days work at the greatest job in the world: The Krusty Krab.
[He hears thumping. The customers look to the door to see Karen 2.0 trying to get in the Krusty Krab, but she couldn't open the doors due to her not having any arms. Plankton peeks out of a secret compartment in Karen 2.0]
Plankton: Hey, what's the hold up, Karen 2? That secret formula's not going to steal itself, you know.
Karen 2.0: I'm trying to open the door. You didn't exactly design me with arms, you know.
Plankton: Yes, I suppose that's true. All right, I got this. [He is about to climb out of Karen 2.0, but then he gasps when he sees Karen at the cash register.] What's she doing here? Karen, working at the Krusty Krab? What the?! 
[Karen 2.0 gets pushed into the Krusty Krab by some fish wanting to come in. Karen 2.0 gets pushed in front of Karen.]
Karen: Well, if it isn't Little Miss Home-Wrecker.
Karen 2.0: And if it isn't the washed up analog has-been.
[Plankton pops out of his compartment in Karen 2.0 to listen in on the two Karens' argument.]
Karen: Analog? Who you calling analog?!
[Plankton quickly goes back inside the compartment sensing a fight is about to begin]
Karen 2.0: I see you've taken your proper role as a "Cash Machine."
Karen: At least I don't look like I was designed to be a glorified vacuum cleaner!
Karen 2.0: Well, at least I can say I was designed.
Karen: [Gasps] Why I oughta...!
Karen 2.0: You rusty bucket of bolts.
Karen: You glorified toaster oven!
Karen 2.0: You poor excuse for a house wife.
[The fish gasp and start talking]
Nazz-Mini: Hey, what's going on?
Dave: I don't know, but my money's on the one with the chrome back side.
Mr. Krabs: Seriously? Did you just say money?
[Microphone lowers down and Mr. Krabs grabs it]
Mr. Krabs: Welcome to the fight of the century! Where for only $5.99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question. Which is superior? High-speed integrated circuits?
Karen 2.0: Prepare to have your motherboard rattled.
Mr. Krabs: ...Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?
Karen: You're about to have your cookies crumbled!
Karen 2.0: Bring it.
[Karen and Karen 2.0 start fighting]
Plankton: Wait! This isn't getting me any closer to the formula.
[Karen grabs Karen 2.0 by the neck]
Karen: [Growls]
[Karen 2.0 kicks Karen]
[Karen uppercuts Karen 2.0 and she flies backwards]
[Karen 2.0 headbutts Karen]
Karen 2.0: That will defrag your algorithms. [A crunching noise is heard]
Plankton: Ow!
Karen 2.0: Plankton?
[Karen 2.0 moves back from a squished Plankton]
[Plankton groans in pain and audience gasps]
Karen: [shakes her head] Stop! He's hurt!
Karen 2.0: You're throwing in the towel?
Karen: You heartless homepage-wrecking hussy!
[Karen's arms start spinning around rapidly and she moves towards Karen 2.0]
[Karen 2.0's screen is broken off by Karen's arms and Karen 2.0 falls to the ground and breaks]
[Audience cheers]
Karen: No one runs down my man. Planky, say something...
Plankton: Take me home, baby...
Karen: Even though you are a tiny green loser, I could never stay... [Static] ... mad [Static] ...at [Static] ...you. [Static] [Screen turns off]
[Karen falls to the ground, Plankton screams and dodges]
Plankton: Karen! Don't you leave me, Karen. Not again!
[Plankton opens up Karen 2.0's compartment, takes her battery out and places it in Karen's compartment]
Plankton: I hope this works... Oh, Karen, please wake up! I promise never to take you for granted again!
[Karen's screen shows a spinning hourglass]
Karen: [Screen changes to her speaking line] What happened?
Plankton: I had a reality check, that's what happened.
[Audience claps and Karen stands up]
Plankton: Come on. Let's go home to the Chum Bucket, honey.
Karen: I had the strangest dream. I dreamt there were two of me!
Plankton: Two of you? Heh, well that is strange.
[Karen 2.0's screen explodes. Karen and the customers leave the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, great. There goes me revenue. What am I gonna do now?
SpongeBob: [Holds up Karen 2.0's broken screen] Well, we could rebuild Karen 2.
[Squidward is wearing Karen 2.0's screen as a mask]
Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order, beep, beep?
Mr. Krabs: Keep it up, Mr. Squidward. The kids love robots.
Squidward: Oh, well. I wouldn't do to have my face in a toilet right now.


[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket. Karen is pacing back and forth, waiting for something to be delivered. As she paces, her monitor continuously sparks. Karen groans impatiently and numbers scroll on her screen. At that same moment, Plankton comes in.]
Plankton: Karen, I— [gets run over by Karen]
Karen: [gasps] Oh, sorry, Planky-Bear! [picks Plankton up] I'm just a little distracted waiting for our baby to be delivered.
Plankton: Oh, well, that makes sense. [beat] A baby?! I don't want a baby!
Karen: It's too late to stop it now. [shows the marketing website on her monitor] It's been nine months and the baby is no longer on back order. [shows the order button, which clicked into in stock, then scrolls up to show the out for delivery button]
Plankton: Can we ask for store credit instead? [gasps as he sees the stork drone outside]
[The stork drone flies over the Chum Bucket with Karen's baby. The drone rings the doorbell.]
Karen: My baby's here! [laughs]
Plankton: Not if I have anything to say about it.
[Plankton hops onto a computer and activates the Chum Bucket's hand. The hand closes the roof and goes to fight the drone. The drone holds out a laser and zaps the hand away, opening the roof in the process. The drone drops the bundle and Karen's happily catches it. Karen unwraps the bundle to reveal the baby, which happens to be a little calculator.]
Karen: [giggles and happily squeals] Oh, Planky-Poo, look how cute our baby is!
Plankton: Oh, please, that thing isn't even a graphing calculator. Weak.
Karen: Oh, come on. [holds out her baby] How can you look at our baby's itty wittle keyboard and say he's not the cutest? [gasps as an exclamation point shows on her screen] I have the perfect name for him. Well, don't you wanna know the name?
Plankton: Not really.
Karen: It's Chip. [shows the word "chip" on her screen, then shows an old computer chip] He's named after my grandfather.
[Chip starts to cry.]
Plankton: [groans] Great, here we go with the crying! Will you please hush that thing up?!
[Karen taps on Chip's buttons and Plankton groans angrily. Suddenly, Chip stops crying.]
Karen: There you go. All better.
Plankton: Wow, how did you do that so fast?
Karen: Simple, I just typed 4-4-4-5 in his cute little keyboard.
Plankton: I don't get it.
Karen: [turns Chip upside-down and the numbers show the word, "Shhh" on it.] Shhh.
Plankton: [groans and continues his work] At least it can't get more annoying.
SpongeBob: [giggles as he flies in with a present] Hello! [giggles and a background audience is heard cheering]
[Plankton groans angrily and stomps over to Karen and Chip.]
SpongeBob: [giggles] A little drone told me you two are new parents. So, I just had to bring over a little present for the baby. Hello, baby. [gently rubs Chip's face, making him giggle]
Karen: Oh, I think little Chip likes you.
Plankton: Obviously not the brightest diode in the box.
SpongeBob: Look, Chip, your uncle SpongeBob got you a little something. [opens the present and reveals a can of compressed air] It's a can of compressed air to keep your keys nice and clean, like this! [pushes button and the sprayer flies out, nearly hitting Plankton]
Plankton: Phew.
[The sprayer bounces on the wall and flies back at Plankton, knocking out his eye. SpongeBob giggles, pushes the button on the compressed air can and flies out of the Chum Bucket. The scene changes to Chip, who has appeared to have grown arms and legs, learning how to walk. He goes to walk, but falls down.]
Karen: Come on, walk to Mommy.
[Chip stands up and goes walking to his mother.]
Karen: That's it. You can do it.
[Chip nearly falls down, but continues to walk.]
Karen: You're walking, baby!
Plankton: [chuckles] You call that walking? This is walking. [walks around in place] This is how you do it. This is how it's done.
[Chip goes to walk over to Plankton. When suddenly, Chip's screen shows the word, "upgrade" on it.]
Karen: Ah! Mama's big boy is upgrading!
[Chip upgrades himself and grows out of his diaper and becomes a walking calculator. Chip happily runs over to Karen and hugs her.]
Karen: Aw.
[Plankton slips on some long sheet of paper.]
Plankton: Whoa, ah! [flies over to the trashcan filled with Chip's stinky diapers and groans] This stinks!
[The scene changes to Karen taking Chip to the arcade on a stroller.]
Karen: Let's see if we can find some friends for Mama's special little boy. [enters the arcade] You need to interface with someone fun. Try that video game over there. It doesn't look too dangerous.
[Chip hops out of the stroller, opens the video game's door, and enters the game. Chip appears on the video game's screen and jumps onto the submarine. Chip begins to play the game and goes to collect coins. Karen slowly starts to become worried about Chip's safety. Chip then starts to zap various stuff with the submarine's laser.]
Karen: Careful, Chip.
[Chip continues to zap the video game items.]
Karen: Uh, those monsters are too big. Come out of that game right now!
[Chip ignores his mother's warnings and starts to become more violent in the video game.]
Karen: Chip, get out of there!
[Karen knocks on the game's door, but it wouldn't budge open. She grabs the machine and shakes Chip out. Suddenly, the word, "error" appears on Chip's screen and Chip upgrades himself into a teenage video game console with a red cap.]
Karen: [laughs] So you think you can do whatever you want because you're a teenager now? You just wait until I tell your father.
[Chip makes a loud screeching sound on his screen, indicating that he said a curse word in front of his own mother.]
Karen: What did you just say to me?! [groans angrily as she grabs Chip by the button ears and takes him home]
[The scene changes back to the Chum Bucket. Plankton is still working until Karen comes in with Chip.]
Karen: I told Chip that game was too dangerous, and do you know what he said to me? [makes the same loud screeching noise as red scribbles appear on the screen]
Plankton: And?
Karen: [angrily growls and spins her monitor around] Just talk to your son! I need to cool my circuits. [leaves]
Plankton: [slides himself over to talk to Chip] Ooh, uh, hey, buddy. Heh, what you doing?
Chip: [depressed] Eh…
Plankton: Yeah, I hear you. So, uh, what happened at the arcade?
[Chip mimics every detail of what happened at the arcade. He shows that he was having a fun time playing in one of the videogames by making gun noises. Then he inhales and exhales himself, saying that his mother sucked him out. And then he shows various symbols on his screen with a dolphin sound heard in the background, saying that he said a curse word in front of his mother.]
Plankton: What? You mother stopped your game, even though you were crushing it? Your mother clearly doesn't get you, man. But I have the perfect solution to your problem. Run away.
Chip: Huh?
Plankton: Yes, I said run away. Take off, see the world. You do you.
[Chip was confused about what Plankton said. But after seeing an image of himself running away, he was happy about it.]
Plankton: Eh, now get out of here, you little scamp.
[Chip gets up and leaves the Chum Bucket. Plankton goes back to his work right when Karen comes back in.]
Karen: So, how was your talk with Chip?
Plankton: Oh, it went great. He's a good boy.
Karen: Yeah, he wh— [notices Chip is missing] Where—where is he?
Plankton: Oh, he ran away.
Karen: What?! Why would my baby run away?
Plankton: Because I told him to. Duh.
[Karen screams in an uncontrollable rage. Her hands gather up green electricity and form into a green rolling pin and a green frying pan. Plankton screams in terror as Karen goes to hurt him. Karen throws the green rolling pin at Plankton, which turns into an electric trident and pins him to the wall.]
Plankton: Karen, baby, let's be reasonable here!
Karen: [picks up the trident holding Plankton] You find our son and bring him home this instant or don't bother coming home! [her green frying pan turns into a spiked glove]
Plankton: [screams as Karen flings him out of the Chum Bucket] I'm going! I'm going!
[The scene changes to Plankton driving in a tank while searching for Chip.]
Plankton: Chip! Chip! Where are you, boy? Come to Daddy! Ugh, what am I saying? Chip! Chip!
[Little did Plankton know, Chip is sitting by himself in a dark alley near a garbage can. Just then, a strange looking machine comes out.]
Weird machine: Psst, hey, kid, you lost?
Chip: [shrugs] Meh.
Weird machine: Running away from home, huh? Cool! Why don't you come hang with me and my buddies? [grabs Chip and pushes him over to meet his friends] Oh, don't be scared. In here. Check it out, guys. I found us a new friend.
[Three other weird machines come out and all look at Chip. They all give him a friendly greeting.]
Weird machine: I know, right? It is cool here. There's just one thing. If you wanna be part of us, we're gonna need your parts.
[Chip turns and sees a machine about to be taken apart.]
Machine #1: Uh-oh. [his monitor is unscrewed]
[One of the machines takes the spare part and puts it on another machine, making it into an arm. The machine giggles happily. Chip beeps in terrible fright and goes to run away.]
Weird machine: [grabs Chip] Oh, come on, kid, don't be like that. We've all done it.
[Chip runs off to escape.]
Weird machine: Get him!
[Chip screams in horror as he tries to escape. One machine takes out a huge magnet and uses it to drag Chip back. Chip tries to fight off the magnetic pull, but ends up getting dragged backwards. He gets stuck onto the magnet and the machines prepare to tear Chip apart. Chip struggles to break free and then lets out a loud screeching sound as a call for help. Meanwhile, Plankton is still driving around, looking for Chip.]
Plankton: Chip! Your mother's gonna kill me if I can't find you. [hears the screeching sound] Huh? [his antennas act up and point in the other direction] That's him! He's in trouble! Don't worry, son! Daddy is coming! [drives the tank around and goes to the direction to where Chip's call for help is coming from; plows through the wall near the dark alley] Get away from my son! [one machine chops the tank into pieces] Get away from me!
[The machines chase Plankton around.]
Chip: Father! [breaks free from the magnet] Leave my father alone!
Plankton: [Overhearing Chip and touched] Your first word was "father." Wait until I rub this in Karen's face. [chuckles as he continues to run]
[Chip hops onto an old ice cream machine and hacks into it, making it his own tank. He then shoots ice cream at the machines, breaking several of them into pieces. He shoots ice cream onto the ground, making one of them slip and break apart.]
Weird machine: No! The delicious horror! [gets sprayed by Chip's ice cream machine] Ah!
[The scene changes back to the Chum Bucket. Plankton and Chip are telling Karen what happened in downtown Bikini Bottom.]
Plankton: Oh, you should've seen it, Karen. Chip was all like, "Stay away from my daddy, who is the most brilliant, handsome genius in the world."
Karen: [rolls her eyes in disgust] Oh, brother.
Plankton: [hops onto Chip's monitor, making him drop his ice cream] Aw, we have got the best kid ever!
[Suddenly, Chip starts going through another upgrade. As Chip upgrades, Plankton loses his balance and falls in the ice cream on the floor. Chip upgrades himself into a young adult computer with a backpack.]
Karen: Oh! [giggles] Aw.
Plankton: [pulls himself out of the ice cream] Come on, son, let your old man buy you a quart of oil. [hops onto Chip's screen] Whoo-hoo! [giggles] Yes!
Chip: [removes Plankton from his screen] Sorry, Dad, I'd love to, but I'm leaving for college. [sets Plankton down on Karen's hand]
Plankton: [gets teary-eyed] I went to college. [sobs alongside with Karen as a waterfall appears on her screen]
[Chip exits the Chum Bucket, climbs onto a bus parked to the curb, waves good-bye to his family, and drives off to college.]
French narrator: Eight semesters later...
[The scene changes to the First Nautical Bank. Chip, now a full grown adult, is working as an ATM there. Just then, Mr. Krabs comes in. But little does anyone know that Plankton and Karen are secretly spying on Chip at his first day of his job.]
Plankton: [chuckles before Karen flicks him] Ouch! Watch it, Karen! We don't want Chip to know we're spying on his first day of work.
[Mr. Krabs inserts his credit card and types in the numbers 1234.]
Chip: [scans Mr. Krabs' credit card numbers] Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[Mr. Krabs giggles excitedly and money comes out of Chip's money slot. Mr. Krabs goes to get it, but Chip pulls the money back in. Mr. Krabs does it again, but the money gets pulled back in again. He does it a couple of time, but Chip still wouldn't give Mr. Krabs the money.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what? [groans while shaking Chip]
[Mr. Krabs bangs on Chip's monitor and goes to grab the money. But discovers that Chip pulled the money back in.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! [tries to grab the money, but fails when Chip pulls them back] Hey! Give me my money! [sobs]
Plankton: [laughs while Karen smiles with a heart on her screen] That's my boy!


[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket. Karen is spending some quality time with another computer named Hanna.]
Karen: Oh, it was so great catching up with you, Hanna. [she and Hanna give a toast to each other] It's been too long.
[Hanna eats a green microchip and sneezes on Karen's computer screen.]
Karen: Oh, you poor thing. Sounds like you have a bug. Better go home and reboot. [escorts Hanna to the door] Remember, only keywords tonight. You need to rest your processor.
Plankton: [off-screen] Karen!
[Plankton is shown waiting for his meal.]
Karen: What do you want? [sneezes and groans while showing the thermometer on her screen]
Plankton: Oh, no. Your nodes are swollen. That old bucket of bolts gave you a computer virus.
Karen: Oh, nonsense. I'm the fastest computer alive. [stammers as she short-circuits and goes haywire]
[Karen rams into the wall.]
Karen: Uh-oh. [laughs] My ones and zeroes look like 10, 10, 10, 10.
Plankton: Someone's gonna have to get inside you and kill that virus. It's probably a suicide mission. [lifts Karen's hand] But who would be stupid enough to—[hears someone knocking on the door; he opens and it turns out to be SpongeBob hitting it with a hammer on his head] What now?
SpongeBob: [falls over and uses his tongue to get himself up] Oh, I'm just helping out the Health Department.
Plankton: Hmm. [puts on glasses and reads the sign on the door] "Sanitary notice. The Chum Bucket hereby gets a grade Z from the Health Department." [throws away the glasses] Hey, that's up from a negative Z last week.
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Plankton. In a few more years, you're sure to get an F. [stuffs his hammer in his hammer, pulls his right leg off, and trips over] Whoa!
Plankton: [throws SpongeBob's leg away] Never mind about that. I have a snow job—Uh, job for you. Karen needs your help. She asked for you personally.
Karen: [off-screen] ♪Who lives in a crabapple under a pea♪
SpongeBob: Hey, catchy song.
[The scene changes to Karen being placed on the examination table.]
Karen: ♪Observant and yellow fellow is he♪
[Plankton straps SpongeBob with a jet backpack with weaponry items in it.]
SpongeBob: We need a name for this mission. How about, "Journey to the Center of Karen?" No. "The Mainframe Mission." Nah. Ooh, I know. "Operation: Save Karen." [holds up a drawing of SpongeBob with the words "Operation: Save Karen" on it]
Plankton: Whatever, just blast the virus when you see it.
SpongeBob: Oh, like this? [pushes the button and lasers fire all over the place, causing them all to explode] Oops.
Karen: [laughs] That tickles. [laughs]
Plankton: [blows the fire out on his antenna] Here, use this. [gives SpongeBob the flyswatter]
SpongeBob: But Plankton, how am I supposed to—[gets zapped by Plankton's teleporter] Whoa!
[SpongeBob appears on the computer screen about Plankton.]
SpongeBob: [laughs and gets poked by Plankton's injector] Ow!
[Plankton absorbs SpongeBob in the injector and pokes it into medical liter bag. SpongeBob then flows through the bag and into the Karen's computerized blood stream.]
Plankton: [climbs down and comforts Karen] Don't worry, baby. Help is on the way.
Karen: Get away. [smacks Plankton]
[Plankton is sent flying over to some cut wires and gets himself electrocuted.]
Plankton: Ow!
[The screen zooms into Karen's hard drive while she downloads SpongeBob. The screen shows Karen's hard drive being created and SpongeBob is digitally teleported in her.]
SpongeBob: [shakes the data particles off] Whoa! [sees the inside of Karen for the first time. Tall structures on the motherboard spread out before SpongeBob like a bustling city.] Super-awesome-ular-tastic! [his eyeballs inflate and pop] Wow! [restores his eyeballs] Huh?
[A computerized megaphone appears next to SpongeBob.]
Plankton: [via megaphone] SpongeBob, can you hear me? [normal] Come in, SpongeBob. [dodges Karen's incoming arm] Talk to me, you digitized doofus!
SpongeBob: Plankton, I do not respond to insults.
Plankton: [via megaphone; sighs] Okay. Just look for any destruction and follow it to the virus. Sweetheart.
SpongeBob: Got it, Honey. [skips backwards until he comes to a hole created by the virus; he falls downward] Whoa!
[SpongeBob grabs onto a loose wire to prevent himself from falling. But he loses the flyswatter as it falls and gets eaten by the virus. Meanwhile, outside of Karen's body, Karen gets off the examination table and rips the medical bag off her.]
Karen: [laughs] I want a Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Baby!
Karen: [plows through the door] Bye-bye!
Plankton: [follows her outside] SpongeBob, hurry up and kill that virus before it completely destroys Karen!
[Karen picks up a boat and throws it in the sky, destroying the Krusty Krab sign and making a flower cloud fall. Plankton's jaw drops and his eyeball falls on his tongue in shock.]
Karen: Knock, knock! [rips the front door off the Krusty Krab]
Plankton: Huh? Great Neptune's nostrils! [sticks his eyeball back and runs to the Krusty Krab]
[Back inside Karen, SpongeBob falls into the hole and lands in a puddle of green slime.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [picks up a sample of the green slime] Hmm. [gasps] The virus!
[SpongeBob follows slime trail and sees the destruction the virus created.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, it looks like the virus is heading to Karen's memory banks.
[Back at the Krusty Krab, Karen is going on a rampage all over the place.]
Plankton: Listen, if it gets to her memory, it'll fry her hard drive completely. I need you to destroy that virus right now!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, I need you to control your wife. Er, computer, or whatever.
Plankton: Mind your own business, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: This is my business!
[Karen grabs and throws Squidward away. She then climbs into the register boat and begins flirting with the cash register.]
Karen: Hello there, baby! Where've you been all my life?
Mr. Krabs: [screams and grabs the cash register] Please don't break up our happy home. I forgive you, baby. [kisses the cash register, heads into his office and closes his door]
Plankton: Wow, I can never unsee that.
[Back inside Karen, SpongeBob pulls himself up a ledge and sees everything dark. He looks around to see if there's any destruction caused by the virus, but he accidentally activates a security button.]
Karen: Intruder detected.
[The floor glows and lasers fire at SpongeBob. But just as SpongeBob was about to get blasted, someone pushed him safely out of the way. It was a computerized version of Plankton, but he's taller, muscular, and more heroic than his evil counterpart. He is called Ideal Plankton. Ideal Plankton pulls out a laser gun and blasts the lasers with it. He opens the floor, grabs SpongeBob and falls through it. He and SpongeBob land safely on the ground.]
SpongeBob: Plankton?
Ideal Plankton: That's my name. [his teeth glimmers] Actually, I'm Karen's version of Plankton. You know, how she'd like to see me. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Ooh, you have beautiful eye. [rubs Ideal Plankton's eye]
Ideal Plankton: We'd better get moving.
[Ideal Plankton runs off while SpongeBob follows. Meanwhile, the virus is eating up everything in Karen's hard drive. The virus eats up the House of Anger.]
Karen: Anger control center abolished.
[The virus then eats up the Tunnel of Love.]
Karen: Love center destroyed.
[Ideal Plankton climbs up a wall with SpongeBob on his back. He punches a hole through the wall and climbs through it. The wall turns right-side up, revealing itself to be a floor. SpongeBob and Ideal Plankton climb out from the floor while all of a sudden, a virus version of Mr. Krabs appears.]
Money Krabs: Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, is that you?
Ideal Plankton: It's Karen's version of Krabs.
SpongeBob: Hey, looking good, Mr. K.
[Then a blue, slimy, and ugly virus version of Squidward appears.]
Gnarly Squid: I hate everything. [drops to the ground and leaks slime]
Ideal Plankton: That's how Karen sees Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hmm? [puts make-up on] Uh, nothing like a little make-up couldn't fix. [chuckles] Hey, I wonder if Karen has a version of me down here.
[A virus version of SpongeBob appears.]
Off Model SpongeBob: Woop, woop, zing, zing. Woop, woop, zing, zing.
SpongeBob: Ooh, now that guy's a hunk.
[Suddenly, the siren goes off.]
Karen: Intruder in section B. Eliminate.
[Off Model SpongeBob, Gnarly Squid, and Money Krabs fire laser beams at SpongeBob and Ideal Plankton. SpongeBob and Ideal Plankton dodge the incoming lasers. Ideal Plankton blasts Money Krabs into little pennies, which have faces of Money Krabs on them.]
SpongeBob: [gets hit by the pennies] Ow! [blows the pennies out of his holes and grabs one of them; the penny then bites SpongeBob's thumb] Yeowch! [drops the penny]
[Ideal Plankton grabs Gnarly Squid and squeezes him really tight.]
Gnarly Squid: Owie, owie, owie. [explodes into a puddle of slime]
Ideal Plankton: What a drip.
[Off Model SpongeBob comes charging towards SpongeBob.]
Off Model SpongeBob: Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
[SpongeBob screams and runs over to Off Model SpongeBob.]
Off Model SpongeBob: Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
[SpongeBob continues to run and scream as he rams into Off Model SpongeBob. But in doing so, he transforms into an exact copy of Off Model SpongeBob himself.]
SpongeBob: Duh.
Off Model SpongeBob: Duh.
SpongeBob: Doy.
Off Model SpongeBob: Doy.
SpongeBob: Duh.
Off Model SpongeBob: Duh.
SpongeBob: Doy.
Off Model SpongeBob: Doy.
Ideal Plankton: Neptune's network! Which one of you is the real SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob and Off Model SpongeBob point at each other. Then stare at themselves in confusion.]
Ideal Plankton: I'll have to use all the computation power I have to figure this out. Eeny, meeny, miney, moe. [blasts Off Model SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Duh, duh, doy, doy. Duh, duh, doy, doy.
Ideal Plankton: Oh, no. I think I destroyed the wrong SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Duh, duh, doy—[shakes himself back to his normal form] How do I look?
Ideal Plankton: Stunning.
[Just then, an explosion knocks over Ideal Plankton from behind. Out from the smoke appears the virus. It roars and lets out blobs of green slime everywhere.]
Ideal Plankton: Hmm. Voracious virus!
[The virus slithers over to Karen's memory banks. Ideal Plankton sees a wire dangling from above.]
Ideal Plankton: There's still time to save Karen. [pulls off one of his antennas, ties it to a wire and through it to the lose wire for them to swing across] You first.
[SpongeBob swings across while imitating a Tarzan-like yell. He barely makes it to the ledge.]
SpongeBob: Whoops. Did I do good?
[Part of the ledge crumbles under Ideal Plankton's feet.]
Ideal Plankton: You did great. But I think you could use a little push.
[Ideal Plankton uses his eyeball to push SpongeBob closer to the other side.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, okay, your turn.
[But before Ideal Plankton can have his turn to swing across, the ground beneath him gave way and he falls into the ravine below.]
Ideal Plankton: It's up to you, SpongeBob! You must save Karen!
SpongeBob: No!
Ideal Plankton: What do you mean, no?!
SpongeBob: I mean, yes!
[Meanwhile, Karen is driving crazily in a boatmobile with Plankton sitting in the passenger seat.]
Plankton: Uh, sweetie, maybe we should slow down and pull over. Honey? Precious?
Karen: No way, Plankie! It's me and you, amigo! Whoo-hoo! [drives over to the Wagon Wheel] Oh, hot dog! Let's go dancing! Whoo-hoo! [crashes the boat and enters the Wagon Wheel to join some square dancers] Whoo-hoo, yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Plankton: How are all these people able to dance here in the middle of the day? Don't they have jobs?
Karen: Whoo! [laughs and spins]
[Plankton is flung over to a female square dancer.]
Plankton: SpongeBob, come in, SpongeBob! If you're gonna do anything, do it now! Karen's about to melt down!
[Karen's computer screen begins to glow red and heat up.]
Female hick: Oh, such a cute one-eyed baby.
Plankton: SpongeBob!
[Back inside of Karen, SpongeBob makes it to the memory banks, in which he dashes to the entrance off. Inside, SpongeBob sees various memories Karen stored from the past. All the memories are pink, brain-shaped structures and they're showing footage from older episodes. The virus slithers over to one memory and takes a bite from it. The screen shows nothing but static after he's eaten it. SpongeBob runs between some columns, with one destroyed as a casualty of the virus. He runs up to the virus and forms himself into a stop sign shape as a confrontation to the virus.]
SpongeBob: Stop munching on those memories, you monster!
[The virus turns and charges in on SpongeBob. But SpongeBob dodges it and the virus roars out green slime, and it splatters onto SpongeBob, in which he spins around and has on his karate gear after he stops spining.]
SpongeBob: [having donned his karate gear] Hi-yah!
[The virus morphs itself into a towering dragon and blows fire at SpongeBob. The fire engulfs SpongeBob and when the flames dissipate, SpongeBob's karate gear is replaced with pink cat attire.]
SpongeBob: [nervously]Meow?
[SpongeBob makes a run for it, with the virus trailing right behind. SpongeBob runs past more memories until he runs into a brick wall, which is a dead end.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, I'm at the edge of Karen's memory! She has to create more memories! I need space to run.
[Karen bursts out from the Wagon Wheel and heads straight for Bikini Bottom.]
Plankton: [running after her] Is my running after here enough of a memory?
[The wall only moves a few inches.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm afraid not.
[A shadow looms over SpongeBob, who presses his back against the wall in fear. The virus dragon blows smoke from his nostrils like a bull, and he closes in on SpongeBob, only for his body parts to disassemble and scatter as the virus reverts back to normal.  SpongeBob spins and puts himself back together, holding one yellow cube in his hand.]
SpongeBob: I always wind up with one extra piece. [He throws it on the ground and the virus eats it.] Oh, you must be hungry. That's why you're eating through Karen.
Virus: [with a pleading face] I'm always hungry.
SpongeBob: [rubbing his face sympathetically] You poor, ugly, disgusting little virus. I know what you need.
[Back outside, Karen grows tired and her screen steams up smoke. Then she finally stops moves and shuts off.]
Plankton: SpongeBob, I've decided to pull you out! We're abandoning Operation: Save Karen.
SpongeBob: [opens up Karen's screen like a door] I got the virus. [jumps out with a microscope] Look.
[Plankton looks through the microscope and sees the virus.]
Virus: Hi, there!
SpongeBob: [grabs the virus and puts it on a Krabby Patty. The virus may have been huge when SpongeBob journeyed through Karen, but it looks a lot smaller on top of the Krabby Patty.] Here you go, little fella. It'll take the virus 300 years to chew its way through this sandwich.
Virus: Whoo-hoo!
Karen: [wakes up] Oh. Huh?
Plankton: [being shown as Ideal Plankton as Karen looks at him] Baby, you're all right!
Karen: Nope. I'm still delirious. But I like it! [laughs]


[Squidward comes out from his house and breathes happily.]
Squidward: Another beautiful Sunday in Bikini Bottom. Nothing can ruin my good mood today!
SpongeBob: [looks out of his window and goes to the door] Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: [walks by] Ignoring, ignoring! La la dum. La la dee. La la doo. [cha chas down the street and trips on a gum] Chewing gum!? That's disgusting! [pulls his foot away but the gum stays on his foot] Oh, c'mon! [tries pulling it off with his hand but it gets stuck, then tries both of his hands but they get stuck, then he pulls harder but his head gets stuck. Then uses head and hands but gets even more stuck. He struggles but he gets completely covered in gum. He then screams angrily, blowing a bubble that bursts the gum and Squidward gets covered in gum. Tries to get it off again and it turns into a bow-tie and he gets it off] People who litter really bug me! [throws it away. Laughs] Litterbugs. [laughing] Litterbugs! [continues laughing]
Officer John: [gum ends up in front of him, he picks it up, squeezes it, smells it, chews it, blows a bubble, and spits it] Litter! [sees Squidward] Aha!
Squidward: [continues laughing] Bugs... litter... litter... bugs.
Officer John: Hey, you! Did you throw this gum away?
Squidward: Yes I did, and I like to complain!
Officer John: Ah... So you admit that you are a litterbug?
Squidward: I do... What? No! No no, I just stepped in it!
Officer John: Oh, you sure did, buddy. You disgust me... [Puts the gum in Squidward's mouth and writes a ticket] Maybe this will teach you not to treat the world as your own personal trash can!
Squidward: Bikini Bottom P.D. Ticket for littering. Penalty: Community service?!
[camera zooms to a park where people are picking up trash]
Squidward: Stupid Policeman, I'm no litter bug! [sees there's no more trash left] Hey! No more trash! Looks like I'm done!
[camera zooms out a little to show a thug fish]
Thug Fish: Here, you can have mine. [gives his trash to Squidward to clean up]
Squidward: [sighs] Can things get any worse?
Squilliam: Of course they can!
Squidward: Daagh! Squilliam Fancyson! My arch foe from band class!
Squilliam: Stuck doing community service eh? Court ordered?
Squidward: No! I... um... I'm... volunteering! Yeah, I'm cleaning up Bikini Bottom, selflessly devoting my time to a worthy cause.
Squilliam: Oooh! Maybe if you clean up Bikini Bottom, they'll build a statue of you! Oh, wait! They've already built one... of me! [camera zooms out to show a statue of Squilliam with a trash stick and a trash bag] I cleaned up all of Bikini Bottom in one week.
Mable Monica: Bless you, Squilliam Fancyson! Bless you!
Squidward: [growls] Hmph! I'll clean up Bikini Bottom in a day!
Squilliam: Ooh! Let me help you out. [blows his nose on a tissue and drops it] There! That should get you started. Tah-tah! [leaves]
[Officer John walks by, growls when he sees the tissue and writes another ticket for Squidward. Later, Squidward is picking up trash]
Squidward: Squilliam thinks he's sooo amazing! [picks trash] Phew! [wipes his forehead and sees that his trash bag is getting full] Hmmm, I've gotta find some place to dump this litter. [sees a trash can] Oh oh oh! Perfect! [opens it] Full! They're all full! How am I gonna hold all this... [sees a kid with his wagon, thinks and trips him]
Taylor: Whoops!
[Squidward uses the wagon for keeping the trash and an old lady walks out]
Mabel: Oh is it trash day? I thought it was Tuesday!
Squidward: What? No!
Mabel: [puts her trash in the wagon] Hey everybody, it's trash day!
Other Fish: Trash day?! [they start putting their trash in the wagon]
Squidward: Hey! Hold on! Stop! I'm not the garbage man! [there's a lot of trash on the wagon] Help.
[a hand gets out of a bag, unties the string and out comes SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I'll help you Squidward!
Squidward: Why are you in a trash bag?
SpongeBob: I wanted to study the complete life cycle of a Krabby Patty. [takes out a Krabby Patty] Tch-tch-tch, all alone. Poor guy. [jumps to the ground] I could get rid of your trash, Squidward!
Squidward: No thank you! I'll do it myself. [begins walking away while SpongeBob follows him]
SpongeBob: Please let me help!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Please?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Pretty please?
Squidward: No way!
SpongeBob: Pretty please with candy sprinkles on top?
Squidward: [stops walking] Listen closely, I don't need your help! I would rather be beaten to a pulp!
Taylor: That's him, mommy! That's the man who stole my wagon! Beat him to a pulp!
Taylor's mother: Hmmm!
SpongeBob: Hi, lady!
[The muscular mother beats up Squidward, dumps the trash on Squidward and leaves with her son and his wagon. The officer shakes his head in disapproval and writes another ticket for Squidward]
SpongeBob: Can I help you now?
Squidward: Alright! Fine! You can help me.
SpongeBob: [spins in a circle] Yay! [as he does this, trash comes flying out of his spot] Thank you, Squidward.
Squidward: Well... you gonna help me!?
SpongeBob: First, close your eyes!
Squidward: Why?
SpongeBob: C'mon!
Squidward: Fine! [closes his eyes] Now what?
SpongeBob: No peeking. [metallic noises are heard]
Squidward: Oh brother.
SpongeBob: Okay! You can open your eyes now!
Squidward: Oh this is so stuuuuuu... [sees that the trash has vanished] ...pid. It's gone! Where did you put the trash?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] I put it in...
Squidward: Know what? Don't care! The trash is gone. Thanks, SpongeBob. I hate you a little less now.
SpongeBob: Squidward, that... that's a beautiful thing to say!
[Squidward and SpongeBob walk to their houses]
Squidward: Well, I don't know how you did it, but thank you for getting rid of all that trash. They'll have that statue of me built in no time! [he enters his house which is made out of the trash where is junk kettle is steaming. He pours out junk into his junk cup. He drinks it and has some junk toast with junk butter. He then has a junky bath and starts to sleep in his junk bed. He then sniffs, realizes all the junk, then screams while running out of the house and gasps] My house!
Officer John: Is this yours?
Squidward: Yes.
Officer John: [gives Squidward his fourth ticket and leaves. The ticket falls down so he walks back] Tch-tch-tch, some people never learn. [gives Squidward his fifth ticket and he walks away. Squidward gets angry and his veins crunch up to form 'I AM ANGRY']
SpongeBob: I am angry? Squidward, why are you angry?
Squidward: [angrily pulls the ticket from his face. Calms down] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes.
Squidward: What's this?
SpongeBob: Your garbage.
Squidward: Where's my house?
SpongeBob: On top of your garbage. [camera zooms out and shows Squidward's house] The dump was closed. [Squidward sighs] So I bought it here.
Squidward: [sighs again] How?
SpongeBob: Like this. [absorbs all of Squidward's garbage and Squidward gasps] Do you wanna try? [garbage falls out of his mouth]
Squidward: Of all the garbage that comes out of your mouth, this is the least annoying. [laughs and the officer comes and gives him another ticket]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward... [more garbage falls from his mouth and the officer takes out his notepad and pencil]
Squidward: Wait! Wait! Zip it! I have an idea! [Squidward goes and comes back with a trash can] Here stand in this. [SpongeBob stands in the bin] See ya sucker! [laughs]
Officer John: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
Squidward: Neptune no!
Officer John: [sees the trash can belongs to SpongeBob] Uh-huh. Oh you got your kicks out of putting trash in other people's bins, eh? [gives Squidward another ticket. Squidward and SpongeBob walk through the streets]
Squidward: They were gonna build a statue of me! [starts crying in despair]
SpongeBob: Oh, a statue, eh? [a few moments later, hammering and drilling noises are heard] Hey, Squidward! Look! [shows a blanket which has a figure under it]
Squidward: What is that?!
SpongeBob: Your very own statue!
Squidward: [gasps] Really?! [SpongeBob throws the cloak away to reveal a smelly statue of Squidward made out of the garbage Spongebob absorbed] Garbage. I'm made of garbage.
SpongeBob: You sure are!
Squilliam: [laughs] Great job, SpongeBob, you even captured his smell. The scent of failure. [the smell melts Squilliam's statue] My glorious statue!
Officer John: This is your statue?
Squilliam: It was. [the officer gives Squilliam a ticket]
Squidward: Ha! Thanks, SpongeBob!
[Officer John coughs to catch Squidward's attention and a can falls down from the statue. The officer gives Squidward and SpongeBob a ticket]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab and Squidward is doing his duty at the cash register. Just then, something sucks through the window behind him. He looks in and sees SpongeBob trying to hold his breath]
Squidward: SpongeBob, how about more Krabby Patties and less heavy breathing?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob uses his spatula to stop the alarm clock and he breathes out the air he's been holding onto Squidward causing his head to expand. Squidward pushes backs out of the window] Wow! That's the longest I've held my breath: three whole seconds. I'm gonna try for five seconds next. [takes a very deep breath]
Squidward: Keep that up and you'll lose consciousness. [under his breath] Tentacles crossed.
SpongeBob: [trying to hold his breath as his face turns blue] Silly Squidward. I'm not going to-- [loses consciousness as Mr. Krabs bursts in the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: What's going on around here? [notices SpongeBob lying unconscious on the kitchen floor. He takes out the bottle containing the secret formula and the smell of it revives him. SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob [speaking gibberish]: What's going on?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I could be asking you the same thing, boy.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was merely emulating my latest media obsession... [points to a poster saying "KENNY! The Cat" with a picture of Kenny on it] ♪ Kenny the Cat ♪
Mr. Krabs: Kenny the Cat? What in clams' name is a... "the cat"?
SpongeBob: He's the greatest undersea athlete to originate from above the wet and briney. [points to several pictures of Kenny's famous career] And he's been shattering records all over, holding his breath as he walks the ocean floor. I want to be just like Kenny the Cat. [takes a deep breath and holds it as he walks to Mr. Krabs] That's what he does: he walks like that and holds his breath like that. Kenny is a sensationality. [takes out a tray of uncooked patties with lettuces cut in the shape of Kenny the Cat's head] Haven't you noticed my recent lettuce customization?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: [runs up to a huge collection of magazines with Kenny the Cat on them] And you haven't perused my collection of Kenny the Cat periodicals? [turns on the tv] Or noticed Kenny on every TV channel known to fishkind?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, no.
SpongeBob: [opens the door and a blimp shaped in the head of Kenny the Cat is flying] But what about the Kenny the Cat blimp which hovers over Kenny the Cat Sports Stadium?
Mr. Krabs: Never noticed it. [walks away, unimpressed]
SpongeBob: Huh. You haven't seen him in your wallet?
Mr. Krabs: [stops and gasps as he takes out his wallet] Me wallet?! What's he been doing in there? [takes out a couple of dollar bills with Kenny the Cat on them]
SpongeBob: Oh, he's on all the new $50 bills.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that Kenny the Cat. Well, he's a sensationality.
SpongeBob: Yeah! And he's visiting Bikini Bottom tomorrow with hundreds of his rabidly, loyal fans.
Mr. Krabs: Hundreds, you say?
SpongeBob: Maybe even a thousand! [Mr. Krabs poses himself as a dollar sign in joy and triumph]
Mr. Krabs: Say, kiddo, why don't see if you can't get old Kenny and his throng of fans to visit the old Krusty Krab for a while?
SpongeBob: I shall do my Krustiest, sir. [cuts to SpongeBob visiting Sandy's treedome but with no water helmet]
Sandy: [notices SpongeBob not wearing a water helmet and gasps in horror of his safety] SpongeBob, don't you want your water helmet? [tries to give him one as SpongeBob walks in holding his breath]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Not necessary, Sandy. Like my personal hero, Kenny the Cat, I'm A-ok. [SpongeBob makes an A-ok hand-gesture. He suddenly dries up and falls flat on the grass]
Sandy: [sprays water on SpongeBob with a hose] Well, if you ain't going to use your helmet, I suggest you make it quick, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [restores to normal] Hey, Sandy, you're kinda like a cat, aren't you?
Sandy: [flips her head upside-down in disbelief] Cat?! [turns her head rightside-up] In what way am I kind of like a cat?
SpongeBob: Well, aren't cats and squirrels basically the same thing?
Sandy: We are both mammals, but that is where the similarities end. Cats are no good scoundrels and I ain't never trusting one of them!
SpongeBob: Well, you can trust Kenny the-. He's the heroic cat who has been holding his breath for days at a time.
Sandy: [continues to spray water on SpongeBob with her hose] I hate to precipitate on your party, SpongeBob, but that is impossible. No air breather could ever do that. Not even me! [quivers in fear]
SpongeBob: Very well, Sandra. If that is your stance, then so be it. Could "someone" be jealous of Kenny's dazzling lung capacity? [cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick in sleeping bags, and wearing foam hands on the street waiting for Kenny the Cat]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Kenny the Cat! Kenny the Cat! Kenny the Cat! [Nat Peterson walks by]
Nat Peterson: You do know that Kenny won't be here until 10:00.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Nat Peterson: Tomorrow morning.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh, yeah. 14 hours is cutting it close but I had to work all day.
Nat Peterson: Hopeless. [walks away]
SpongeBob: You know, I read in Kenny Fancy Magazine that he's so used to holding his breath that when he's topside, he forgets to breathe.
Patrick: Wow! [laughs] Oh, that'd be like me forgetting to-- [panicking] Oh! Oh, oh, oh...[takes out a taco from his pocket] Oh, there you are, pocket taco. [eats it]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick, have you ever gazed up into the starry night and see Kenny the Cat's face?
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: [makes shapes with his fingers like he's connecting the dots] Find the goober constellation and the dorsal constellation, then squint your eyes and let the details fall into place. [a picture of Kenny the Cat is seen in the starry sky]
Patrick: [tries to see it but can't] Uh... Nope, I don't see it. Kenny's really gotten into your head lately.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Kenny's awesome. Hey, that reminds me! [takes out his make-up kit] Let's paint our faces to look like Kenny! [puts make-up on Patrick's face] Perfect! [Patrick's face is painted in a really ugly looking design of Kenny the Cat] We're the biggest Kenny the Cat fans ever!
Patrick: [Patrick looks at himself in the mirror] This, uh, is getting creepy.
SpongeBob: [paints a nasty looking cat face on himself] Hey, buddy. Check it out.
Patrick: [SpongeBob's make-up scares Patrick] Sweet Neptune! Uh, SpongeBob, uh, I'm going to go now. Your obsession with Kenny is getting weird.
SpongeBob: But you didn't even get to see my new Kenny the Cat temporary tattoo! [pulls down his pants and shows Patrick his tattoo]
Patrick: Oh, that's okay. See you, SpongeBob! [runs away completely freaked out]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess it's plain to see who the true Kenny the Cat fan is. [cuts to SpongeBob still awake in his sleeping bag until his alarm clock goes off] 10:00! Kenny Time! [jumps out of his sleeping bag and stands next to the announcer]
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time you've all been waiting for. Kenny the Cat will do his signature walk. [Kenny comes down the street, photographers take pictures]
SpongeBob: [head turns into the shape of a heart] Kenny!
Harold: Thanks, Kenny! [Kenny signs his fin]
SpongeBob: Kenny, sir, it would mean a lot if you'd sign my official Kenny the Cat spatula. [Kenny signs spatula] Thanks, Kenny. You're so real. [Kenny nods in agreement] Oh, you're hungry? What do you say we move this autograph session to the Krusty Krab? [Kenny gives him his A-ok handsign. SpongeBob stutters] Did you see that?! Kenny just gave me his trademark A-ok handsign! [does a silly dance] Swoon! Swoon! [cut to the Krusty Krab where a huge crowd is in front of it]
Crowd: [random chatter]
Mr. Krabs: One at a time, one at a time, please! Kenny the Cat will have time to meet each and every one of you's. [quietly] And I will have time to take each and every one of your dollars. [normal voice; shocked] Look at myself. I'm not being a very good host. [goes to Kenny Uh, excuse me. You just make yourself at home, Kenny. I mean, Mr. the Cat. [takes out two ketchup packets and one mustard packet] Here you go! Condiments. On the house. Don't tell anybody. Welcome to the Krusty Krab family. [laughs]
[Kenny's oxygen tank slips from his back]
SpongeBob: Mr. the Cat? Everything OK? [Kenny draws a toilet and shows it to him] Say, Mr. Krabs, this is gonna be a long day for Kenny. How about we give him a minute to freshen up?
Mr. Krabs: What an excellent idea, SpongeBob! "A clean cat is a moneymaking cat," I always say. Please avail yourself of the lounge facilities. [Kenny goes to the washroom]
SpongeBob: Well, I'd best get back manning the grill.
Kenny: [takes out the oxygen tank and throws it on the ground] This gets real uncomfortable after a while. [breathes in. His face turns blue. He runs to the oxygen tank] 
SpongeBob: [enters the bathroom with a Krabby Patty on a plate] Sorry to bother you, Mr. the Cat, but I thought you'd just like a bite to… [drops the patty] Whoa!
Kenny: [breathes through the oxygen tank and sighs. SpongeBob starts to panic] Good thing I've got this oxygen tank and mask, or otherwise there's no way I'd be able to hold my breath for this long.
SpongeBob: [camera zooms in to his heart which has a face similar to his. It loses a tooth and eye, then breaks] How could you, Kenny?! You broke my heart! Here I was this entire time believing your act, only to discover that it was nothing but... an act!
Kenny: But it's not what you think!
SpongeBob: There's no room for thoughts now. Only for tears. [runs away, sobbing]
Kenny: SpongeBob, wait! [trips over the oxygen tank, and uses it again]
SpongeBob: I can't believe I fell for such a phony! Oh, well, time to move on. Guess I don't need my Kenny the Cat fan club membership card anymore. [rips card and sniffles] Or these Kenny the Cat posters. Oh, Kenny, how could you? [sobs]: You were my idol! You know, I should really talk about this with someone, or I might get... [close up of his face] depressed.
Kenny: SpongeBob, please, let me explain! I'm just a cat with a dream. A dream to give the gift of hope. See, above water, I'm a nobody: just another annoying cat. But down here, I'm someone special: someone who can make people happy. And if making the world a happier place makes me a criminal... [starts to sob] ...then lock me up and throw away the key. Have mercy! [sobbing]
SpongeBob: All right, Kenny, all right. I promise I won't tell anyone.
Kenny: Really?
SpongeBob: Yes, really. 
Kenny: All right! Thanks, Bob. You're the best friend I ever had! Now if you'll excuse moi, I've got to sign some autographs. [exits the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, the cat of the hour is back!
Crowd: [cheering]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollars—I mean, uh, suckers—I mean, uh, some autographs? [Kenny nods his head]
Crowd: [cheering]
Mr. Krabs: Well, alrighty then. That's what the consuming public wants to hear.
Billy Fishbowl: Sir, I just want to say that you're the biggest inspiration myself and my friends have ever known. Your ability to hold your breath changed our lives... forever. [looks at his three friends. They are holding their breath while their faces turn purple. One of them falls down]
SpongeBob: [looks worried. He reads the note that Kenny wrote] "You're welcome. I've been holding my breath for more than 20 years, no problem." [gulps] "You can too. Signed, Kenny the Breath-Holding Cat"?
Sandy: Hiya, Kenny. Mind if I get your signature? [Kenny writes the signature] Gee, it sure is nice to meet another air-breathing, warm-blooded varmit down here.
Kenny: Mm-hmm.
Sandy: Just out of scientific curiosity, how do you hold your breath for so long? [SpongeBob and Kenny react]
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Uh, we needn't burden ourselves with such needless scientific technicalities, Sandy.
Sandy: I'm just wondering, SpongeBob. I mean, he does defy all scientific logic, [Kenny starts to sweat] considering the fact that all air breathing mammals need oxygen to the brain and lungs to survive for more than 3 minutes. [Sandy makes a serious face at Kenny. SpongeBob pushes her]
SpongeBob: Hey, maybe we should show our fine guest a little more hospitality, hmm?
Sandy: [pushes him back] What has gotten into you, SpongeBob? Can't I talk about what must surely be happening from a biological standpoint? I mean, like the lack of oxygen will heighten the capillaries in the lungs, causing a dangerous level of carbon monoxide to rise in the bloodstream, which in turn leads to a ghostly blue color to the skin, [Kenny's skin turns blue] followed by eventual unconsciousness.
Kenny [screaming]: I can't take it! I need oxygen! [punches himself for his oxygen tank]
Crowd: [gasps]
Kenny: [uses the oxygen tank and sighs]
Sandy: I knew Kenny was a fake! 
Crowd: [boos and leaves]
Crowd Member: Liar!
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! [to Kenny] Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too! [takes back the condiments he gave Kenny. Cut to outside]
SpongeBob: Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career.
Kenny: [in a suit like Sandy's] Aww. It's okay, SpongeBob. Maybe the whole shamble is a big wake-up call to be honest. 
SpongeBob: Hey, I've got an idea. Most cats hate water, right? Well, you can be the cat that likes water. That way, you're still special.
Kenny: I like it! [does the A-ok handsign. SpongeBob does it back]
Sandy: Just get out of here already. [pops part of his suit, and he is rocketed back to the surface] You can never trust a cat. Or is it a dog?


[The episode begins with a group of strange creatures called sea chimps singing in harmony while doing their daily chores. Suddenly, everything starts shaking and the sea chimps screech in fear. It turns out that they reside in an aquarium owned by SpongeBob. SpongeBob is dragging the aquarium down the street singing the same tune as the sea chimps. Fred and his wife are having a date at café when SpongeBob passes by singing and hopping around while dragging his aquarium.]
Fred: You know that child we were planning on having?
Fred and his wife: Let's forget it.
[SpongeBob skids the aquarium to the front doors of the Chum Bucket where he meets up with Karen.]
Karen: SpongeBob, I could hear you caterwauling a mile away.
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, [hops off the aquarium] and thanks for watching my sea chimps while I'm at work. [inhales and blows out his work hat from his head]
Karen: They're already in an aquarium. Why don't you just leave 'em at home?
SpongeBob: [puts earphones over the aquarium and leans in closer so Karen could hear] I think Gary might be trying to eat them. I found saliva on the glass.
Karen: So what do I need to do for them?
SpongeBob: Nothing! They'll take care of themselves. Oh! [feels the wind] Hm! [takes out an umbrella] Well, I got to go. Here's my breeze. [opens his umbrella and flies away with the wind] Whoa-ow-ow-ow!}
[Meanwhile at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs has once again prevented Plankton from stealing the Krabby Patty formula and is carrying him out of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: When will you ever learn that a tiny pipsqueak like you will never, ever take over anything? [stretches and squishes Plankton like putty] What do you call this gizmo you made anyway? [points to a very odd-looking device that is completely unfinished]
[Plankton's device goes haywire and puffs smoke in Plankton's face.]
Plankton: [coughs] The Takeover-er-er.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] That's just stupid. [stretches and flings Plankton back to the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: [flying by Plankton] Morning.
Plankton: Morning…
Mr. Krabs: And don't forget your rube goldfish device! [picks out the machine and hurls it away] There we go.
[Plankton lands at the front doors of the restaurant as usual. But as he got back up, the machine runs on him. Plankton crawls out from under the doors. Plankton straightens his out his back before entering the main room.]
Plankton: Honey, I'm home. [sees SpongeBob's aquarium near the doors] What's this stupid thing?
Karen: Those are SpongeBob's sea chimps. You don't need to bother with them. I'm going back to my shows now. [turns on the screen and watches her soap opera through the mirror; she sees two women fighting and slapping each other] Oh, my!
Plankton: Hmm. Huh? Sea chimps, huh? [gets a closer look through the glass and sees sea chimps continuing their happy-go-lucky lives] Wait a minute. Maybe I've been going about this world conquest thing all wrong. Maybe I should start small and work my way up! [cackles evilly]
[The scene changes to Plankton climbing up the aquarium wearing a shrinking belt.]
Plankton: This shrink belt will allow me to walk among those little monkeys. [turns the dial and shrinks smaller] Alley-oop!
[Plankton jumps and dives down the aquarium. He dives through the clouds and cackles evilly once more before landing in a pile of bananas. One sea chimp, mistaking him for a banana, grabs Plankton, peels his skin and prepares to eat him.]
Plankton: Too small, too small! [turns dial, makes himself bigger, and pulls himself out of the sea chimp's mouth] Huh?
[All of the sea chimps look at Plankton with bizarre looks. They had never seen another creature that is not of their kind in their aquarium before. Plankton then examines the sea chimps and notices that he's taller than them.]
Plankton: [giggles] Hey, why are you idiots so short? [picks up a sea chimp and forms it into a ball; he bounces it and throws it away] You afraid of me? You gonna cry?
[Plankton flicks a baby sea chimp's banana lollipop to the ground and makes it cry. All of the sea chimps run around in fright, screeching and chattering. Plankton grabs three sea chimps and ties them up together.]
Plankton: Listen here, you pint-sized twerps. I'm taking over your monkey town, see? [the sea chimps chatter nervously] Do you little cretins have a king or a queen or something?
[The sea chimps push one of their kind to show Plankton their ruler. It is a purple sea chimp with a gold crown.]
Sea chimp king: Um, I am the king.
Plankton: Yeah? Well, now I'm the king! [takes the crown from the sea chimp king and puts it on his head]
Sea chimp king: Wow! [shakes Plankton's hand] Thank you, sir! I mean, sire. [hops away] I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king! I'm not the king-ing-ing!
Plankton: Why was that so easy? It's so easy because I'm so big and smart! [buffs up his muscles] That's why! [slips on a banana peel and falls backwards] Well, what are you all waiting for? Follow your leader! Fall! [the sea chimps obey their "king" and fall on the ground]
[The scene changes to Plankton taking over the aquarium's castle. He decorated the throne room with portraits and statues of himself. Some of the portraits have Mr. Krabs and Karen on them. Plankton is sitting on his new throne and has made the sea chimps his loyal servants. Some of them gave Plankton their gold and jewelry.]
Plankton: That's right, bring me all your valuables. [an elderly sea chimp holding a big bowl of bananas reveals dentures in his mouth] What are those? Dentures? Hand them over. [the old sea chimp gives Plankton his dentures and puts them in his mouth] Now that's more like it. I want to be the only one in town with stuff! [slips on another banana peel and falls backwards, losing his dentures and crown; the sea chimps fall down as well; Plankton picks up the crown and puts it back on] I'm tired of walking. Carry me!
[The scene changes to the sea chimps carrying Plankton on his throne. Plankton is eating grapes. He takes a grape and throws it in one of the sea chimps' face.]
Sea chimp child: Father! [goes back to licking her lollipop]
Plankton: [laughs] Right in the head! You guys are idiots. I'm the smart one. I've got the best ideas. Hey, you! Here's a grape-flavored idea! [picks a grape and throws it] Hi-yah! [throws three grapes at three sea chimps] Okay, that's enough. I'm bored.
[The sea chimps set Plankton down. Plankton rides a motor bike out from the castle window and drives down the village.]
Plankton: Yeah! [points to various sea chimps as he gloats and drives] I rule you, I rule you, I rule you. I rule you, you, you, and you. [crashes into a fire hydrant and is sent flying onto the back of an old sea chimp lady] Ow! [the sea chimps look at him in confusion] Ta-da! Piggyback for the king! Let's see how fast this old lady can go. [pulls on the old sea chimp lady's hair and kicks her] Hi-yah!
[The old sea chimp lady runs and gallops around like a horse.]
Plankton: Yee-haw! Today, sea chimps, tomorrow, the world! [as Plankton rides the old sea chimp lady down the path, one sea chimp pops out from a bush and shoots a dart] I rule you, I rule you, [gets hit in the head by the dart] and I...rule...you...
[Plankton falls backwards and groans on impact as the screen turns black. Plankton wakes up from his coma and finds himself tied in between two sacrificial poles.]
Plankton: Hey, what is this? Where am I? Okay, ha-ha. Very humorous. Having a bit of fun with the king, [chuckles] I get it. I think my armpits are dry now. You can cut me down. [the sea chimps continue to stare angrily at Plankton] I demand you obey your king! Let's go! Come on, you little bozos! Get me down! [the sea chimps no longer listens to him] Guys? My people? Loyal subjects? [gulps nervously] Buddies?
Sea chimp king: Oh! Hello! Remember me? You took my crown and became the new king? I just wanted to say thanks again. Oh, and, uh, have a nice sacrifice! [leaves]
Plankton: Sacrifice?
Sea chimps: [chanting "tongue"]
Plankton: Tongue? That's a weird request. But as king I'll be benevolent. [sticks out his tongue; suddenly, drops of water come raining down; one drop hits Plankton's eye] Gah! What in Neptune's navel?!
[Just then, as the sea chimps continue chanting, a giant pink tongue descends downward from the clouds and begins attacking Plankton.]
Plankton: [dodges the tongue's attacks] Hey! Whoa! [gets licked by the tongue] Yuck! Time to un-shrink! [tries to reach the dial on his belt, but couldn't due his hands being tied up] Can't...reach...I take it back. I don't want to be king!
Sea chimp king: Nuh-uh-uh! No takee-backsees.
[The tongue closes in on Plankton. The sea chimp king runs off to prevent himself from being licked. Just as the tongue was about to attack again, Plankton bites the tongue and sends it packing.]
Sea chimps: Aww!
Plankton: What do you mean, "aww?" Don't aww!
[The scene cuts back to the Chum Bucket. It turns out that the tongue belongs to Patrick. It also turns out that Patrick was the one trying to eat SpongeBob's sea chimps, not Gary.]
Patrick: Ow! [pulls his tongue back out of the aquarium] That hurt! [his tongue was a severe bite mark; he giggles] Now that snack's got a bite. [picks up the aquarium and drinks the water]
[Due to Patrick moving the aquarium, the sea chimps fall down Patrick's throat. Three sea chimps bind together like barrel monkey toys to prevent themselves from falling further. Plankton is left dangling above Patrick's mouth.]
Sea chimp king: Oh, don't worry, sire! I will cut you loose from the sacrifice. [gnaws on the rope that's holding Plankton's right hand]
Plankton: Hey, stop! Nice old chimp king. Don't do that!
[The sea chimp king cuts through the rope and Plankton swings to the other sacrificial pole. Plankton sees most of the sea chimps descending down Patrick's throat. Patrick continues drinking the aquarium's water. The sea chimp king saws the other rope that's holding Plankton's left hand.]
Plankton: Huh? How did you get over there? [the sea chimp king cuts the rope and Plankton falls] Ahh!
Sea chimp king: [falls alongside Plankton] Hey, you're welcome!
Plankton: Hey, dumbbell! [takes off his shrink belt] Take this end of the belt and wrap it around all the other falling numbskulls and bring it back to me! [stretches the shrink belt] It stretches. Go! [they both wraps the shrink belt around the other sea chimps] You morons should cushion my fall nicely.
[Plankton and the sea chimps all fall down Patrick's throat. Just then, SpongeBob comes back from the Krusty Krab and enters the Chum Bucket. He sees Patrick drinking the aquarium water.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Oh, oh, oh! Patrick! It was you trying to eat my sea chimps the whole time.
[Patrick puts the aquarium down and exit the Chum Bucket in a huff. SpongeBob follows him outside.]
Patrick: I can't believe you'd accuse me of-of-of such a delicious thing! [belches and his stomach rumbles]
[SpongeBob hears his sea chimps chattering in Patrick's stomach.]
SpongeBob: I hear 'em in there. [forms an ear and listens carefully]
Sea chimp king: [inside Patrick's stomach] Hey, King, what's this dialy-doodle-mojig on your belt do?
Plankton: [inside Patrick's stomach] No, don't touch that!
[The sea chimp king turns the dial on Plankton's shrink belt and Patrick's body begins growing and expanding.]
Patrick: Whoa-oh-oh-oh! [the growing stops and it gives Patrick a bad taste of indigestion] I take it back. They weren't that delicious.
[The sea chimp king crawls out from Patrick's mouth.]
Sea chimp king: Whoa! Hey, guys, come on out! There's more room out here.
[All of the sea chimp crawl out of Patrick's body. Patrick flips himself over and sticks his tongue out. Plankton appears to be partially digested and bruised from being inside Patrick's stomach.]
Plankton: [his right antennae is damaged] Partially digested antennae.
SpongeBob: Welcome, sea chimps. I'm SpongeBob, your owner.
Sea chimp king: Forget it, man. We're through with owners, and kings, and aquariums. Whoa! Now that looks like a swell place to live.
[All the sea chimps run into the Chum Bucket. Karen comes out with banana peels all over her monitor.]
Karen: [screams] Plankton! Abandon bucket!
Plankton: Well, that's a write off. [takes out a remote and pushes a button]
[The button activates the Chum Bucket's hand. The hand picks up the restaurant and spins it around and around. The hand throws the restaurant out into the distance with the sea chimps still inside.]
SpongeBob: Bye, sea chimps! Have a good flight! It was so nice of you to help relocate the sea chimps, Plankton. You rule!
Plankton: Not today, SpongeBob. Not today. [takes out his crown] But...someday! [puts it on and cackles evilly before Patrick swallows him and burps out the crown]


Plankton: Oh, come on, Karen, please!
Karen: Well, if you must know...
Plankton: [interrupting] There's nothing wrong with Chum Bucket fare. Why, look! Here's a fresh batch of a delicious new chum sauce. It's called Spicy Chum Surprise. [Shows sauce melting through pan and onto floor where it then starts to melt through the floor] [Pause] Delectable!
Karen: [sarcastically] Oh, I'm sure it'll be a huge success!
[Siren]
Plankton: Sorry, no time for your senseless chatter. I've got a customer to attend to!
[Ding Ding]
Billy: Okay, so what about the Krabby Kola?
Plankton: We don't serve Krabby Kola, we carry Bucket Bubbler and Chum Cherry Blast.
Billy: Okay, well then, can I just make sure I get those Krabby Fries with extra Krabby Sauce?
Plankton: [frustrated] Ugh! How many times must I say it?! We don't carry Krabby Fries, we don't carry Krabby Kola, we don't carry Krabby Sauce, and we don't carry Krabby Patties! So, if you want any of those things, you're gonna have to go to the Krusty Krab, which is located directly across the street!
Billy: Okay, thanks for the directions.
Plankton: [annoyed] Any time. What is wrong with people?! Honestly, I don't think anyone in Bikini Bottom would know a decent meal if it looked them right in the eye and said, "Hello! I'm a decent meal, wonderful to meet you! Please pay money for me and then put me in your mouth so your old pal Plankton doesn't lose everything he's spent his entire life working for!"
Karen: Yeah, and if anyone ever did order one of your meals, it probably would look them in the eye.
Plankton: You know, Karen, sometimes I wonder if you're here to help me run the Chum Bucket or just to make me feel like I'm two inches tall. [Notices ruler right next to where he is standing showing he is indeed two inches tall]
Karen: Maybe in heels. If it wasn't for me, you probably wouldn't even remember to blink!
Plankton: Oh, come on! When we first met, you were little more than a jumbled mass of diodes and wires. I made you what you are today! [Pause] Literally! So don't think you couldn't be replaced in a heartbeat! Ow!
Karen: What's the matter?
Plankton: My eye is burning and I don't know why!
Karen: Blink.
Plankton: [blinks] Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Now where was I!?
Karen: You were threatening to replace me.
Plankton: Oh yeah! I don't need you! I can make a whole army of computers that might actually help me steal the formula!
Karen: Oh, puh-leeze.
Plankton: I'll show you woman! [Marches away]
[Later]
Plankton: Oh, Karen!
[Shows Karen watching a computer movie]
Karen: Now what!?
Plankton: Could you come here for a moment?
[Karen rolls in to the kitchen]
Karen: What do you want?
Plankton: Feast your, uh, screen on this. [Presses red button]
[Contraption rolls out]
Karen: That’s my replacement!? It’s a toaster!
Plankton: Ha ha ha, that, my dear, is a T-119A Compumatic, the finest of its kind.
T-119A Compumatic: Good morning, sir.
Plankton: Good morning, T-119A!
[robot short circuits]
Plankton: They're supposed to do that. [another robot is revealed] Next, behold! The Noxious Enterprises Super SPU-31 Liquid-Cooled Mobile Processing Unit, a mind staggering combination of both power! And refinement.
[Robot tries to come through the doorway but can't, making the glass top break] [Water squirts everywhere]
Karen: [Sarcastically] That'll help you get the formula.
Plankton: And now, Karen, the piece de resistance. [shows robot] Have you ever witnessed such marvelous machinery?
Karen: It sorta just looks like an old hair dryer taped to the back of a miniature windmill.
Plankton: I can see how someone of your level of technical knowledge would think that, Karen, but in actuality what you are looking at is... oh, right.
Karen: I don't recall you ever having reason to own a hair dryer, Plankton.
Plankton: Okay, here we go! Are you going to make me get the picture down again!?
Karen: What picture!?
[Plankton walks down hallway and takes picture off the wall]
[Shows Karen wedding picture of the two of them. Plankton has a full head of hair]
Plankton: You see! Plenty of reason to be using a hair dryer.
Karen: Why are we even talking about this?
Plankton: Because you were the one that said—
[interrupted by torch sounding noises]
Karen: What's going on!?
Plankton: Dear Neptune!
[Shows robots attacking each other]
[Plankton tries to separate robots]
Plankton: Karen, do something! Quick! They're tearing each other apart! Just press a button or something!
[Karen presses the red button Plankton had been using]
Plankton: Not that one!
[Siren sounds]
[Plankton screams as a panel in SPU-31 flips open to reveal a hammer. It immediately targets Plankton and smashes him three times. Plankton walks back up to Karen, smushed.]
Karen: Well, it's good to see that that strategy didn't fall flat!
Plankton: You know, Karen, with you around, I'm beginning to wonder how I'm still alive.
Karen: Ohhh, so it's my fault is it?
Plankton: That's right! Now it's all clear! It's you that's been holding me back! In fact, if it weren't for your constant stifling, I'd have the whole world running for the safety of their mommies!
Karen: You and your crack team of robots, huh?
[Shows robots again beating each other up]
Plankton: Well maybe I could iron out a few bugs, but then you'll see just how much I need you! [looks around] Karen? What's this? [Sees note on the ground] It's words on paper. It says: "Dear Plankton, I've logged onto another network. I just can't go into sleep mode at night knowing that you'll continue blaming me for all of your failures. Anyway, you're a grown single celled organism, and allowed to make your own syntax errors. Nice knowing you, Karen." Dah! who needs her!? Not me! I'm going to steal that Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs once and for all. And then we'll see who's made the error. [Laughs menacingly] Ow! [looks at note] "P.S., don't forget to blink." Oh yeah. [blinks]
[Later]
Plankton: Okay, team, listen up. We're on our own now so we don't have anything holding us back. Now I know you all look upon me kindly since I am your creator, but the last thing the Chum Bucket needs is, if we're going to be victorious, is a bunch of soft, uh, software. Does everybody understand?
[All robots but one make their noise of recognition]
Plankton: I said, does everybody understand!?
[Last robot makes noise of recognition]
Plankton: All right, then let's do this! T-119A to position! [Shows robot fly through the air] SPU-31 to position! Command Module to position!
[Shows Plankton in the command module]
Plankton: Heh heh heh. Now let's see Krabs stop this. I'll show him. I'll show them all!
[Plankton laughs menacingly again]
Perch Perkins: This just in, a diabolical albeit haphazardly thrown-together machine is attacking Bikini Bottom and is headed straight for the Krusty Krab! [click]
[Squidward turns off the TV at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Why is the local news always such rubbish!?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, look! I figured out how to get my mop wet without dipping it in the bucket.
Squidward: SpongeBob, nobody cares about... [interrupted by rumbling and shaking]
[Plankton's robot silhouette is seen in the dust approaching the Krusty Krab]
[Plankton laughs menacingly]
[Propeller from his windmill hits his head knocking off his hat]
Plankton: Hey! Krabs, I wanna see you.
[Mr. Krabs ducks down in the window]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, get out there. [Throws SpongeBob outside towards Plankton's robot]
SpongeBob: Um... hello... what do you want robot thing, sir? [Plankton walks out on a boardwalk] Oh, hey Plankton! What are you doing here?
Plankton: I'm here for the secret formula you twit! Now I want you to go in there and tell Krabs that if he doesn't turn over the formula to me, that he'll be subjected to utter annihilation at my... Are you getting this?
SpongeBob: Uhhhhh, uuh uuh.
Plankton: Uuhhhh, moron! Okay, I'll make it simple: Krabs give me secret formula or I bring big boom boom to Krusty Krab. Got it?
SpongeBob: [Writing on clipboard] Krabs give me secret formula or... uhhh... what was that other thing?
Plankton: [Frustrated] Uhhh! Forget it! [Marches back into his command module, drops SpongeBob] Bring on the Boom Boom!
[Planktons laugh]
[Robot starts marching toward the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Battle stations men! Here he comes!
SpongeBob: We're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed, we're all doomed!
Squidward: [Walking out of the Krusty Krab] Later.
[Robot marching again with Plankton] [You notice that the extension cord that is powering the robot is about to be unplugged]
[Robot stops only feet from the Krusty Krab]
Plankton: Hey, what gives?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs emerge from the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs laughed at Plankton's failed attempt and the two walked away. ]
[Robot collapses]
Plankton: [Crying] Oh curse you cruel fate. Once again, you've left me covered in the sticky goo of my own folly. Only this time, I'm all alone. [More crying]
Karen: Ahem.
Plankton: [Looks up and sees Karen] Karen! You've come back to me!
Karen: Actually, I just came to get my keyboard.
Plankton: Oh, I knew you couldn't stay away, I knew it!
Karen: [sigh] Let me guess, another failure?
Plankton: What you gonna do, machines these days, right? Umm, listen sweetie, I'm sorry about what I said. Truth is, I could never replace you honey-bunch. Lets go home hun?
Karen: [sigh] Okay.
Plankton: Hey, I could whip us up a little dinner, what do ya say?
Karen: Do you want me to leave you again?
Plankton: Or we could go out! That'd be fun too.


TV narrator: [SpongeBob is watching the movie while eating popcorn] We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot.
Man being chased: [screaming while being chased by a giant robot]
SpongeBob: Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on. 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out! [scene cuts to SpongeBob lying in his bed, whimpering and shivering] What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary? [Gary is sleeping] Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear? [pokes Gary's eye, causing him to wake up] 
Gary: Meow! 
SpongeBob: Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right? 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep. [goes to sleep. Dreams about running from the giant robot from the movie earlier. Scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab, with SpongeBob in the kitchen, panting] Robot! OH MY GOSH! [robot turns out to be a sack of potatoes, a dust pan and broom, and a bucket] Huh? [chuckles nervously. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs holding down his money on his office desk] 
Mr. Krabs: How about a little music to count me money to? [turns on the radio that is next to him] 
Radio DJ:  [From the radio] And now for the #1 song in Bikini Bottom: "Electric Zoo." [techno beat is heard. Mr. Krabs starts counting his money] 
Mr. Krabs: Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad! I love this young people's music! [scene cuts to the kitchen. A buzzer goes off] 
SpongeBob: I SURRENDER!!! Oh... 
Squidward: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams. His hat flies onto Squidward's nose] 
SpongeBob: Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose? 
Squidward: [removes the hat from his nose and puts it back on SpongeBob's head] I'm not wearing your hat on my nose! I'm waiting for #17's order! 
SpongeBob: #17 -- [holds up a tray with food] Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh? 
Squidward: [sarcastically] Hilarious. Just deliver the food. 
SpongeBob: [delivers the food to Thaddeus] There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you? 
Thaddeus: No, I'm not. 
SpongeBob: Well, keep your eyes peeled. [in a deep voice] They're everywhere. Back to work! [he runs away, Thaddeus shrugs his shoulders. SpongeBob walks by Mr. Krabs' office] 
Mr. Krabs: [from office] I feel completely recharged! 
SpongeBob: That sounds like Mr. Krabs. [peeks in the window] 
Mr. Krabs: Come on, little buddy, play it again. [shakes his radio] Please? One more time, for me. 
SpongeBob: That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels "recharged." [laughs] If I didn't know better, I'd say he was... [scene zooms in on SpongeBob] ...a robot! Nah. 
Mr. Krabs: [calls the radio station] Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again. 
Radio DJ: [From the phone] Hmmm... which one, man? 
Mr. Krabs: The one that goes "bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep." 
Radio DJ: No, man, you're thinking of wee-wub-wub-womp-wub-wub-womp.
Mr. Krabs: Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop, [Garbled telephone noise] bee-boo-boo-bop, [Garbled telephone noise] boo-boo-bee-bop? [Garbled telephone noise] Not bee-boo-boo-beep? [Garbled telephone noise] Bop...? [Garbled telephone noise] Beep?! [Garbled telephone noise] Boo-boo-bop?! [SpongeBob screams] 
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot? Nah. [peeks into the window again and sees Mr. Krabs doing a robot dance on his desk. He jumps onto Squidward's arms] Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot! 
Squidward: [picks up SpongeBob off his arms] That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen! [throws him in the kitchen. Squidward laughs, but SpongeBob reappears beside him. Squidward is confused and looks around for how he did it] 
SpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too. 
Squidward: [confused] How did you...? 
SpongeBob: Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter] What is it, boy? 
SpongeBob: Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it. 
Mr. Krabs: Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious? 
Squidward: Umm... yeah, sure. 
Mr. Krabs: Well, let's hear it, lad. 
SpongeBob: Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward? 
Squidward: [chuckles nervously] Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie? 
Mr. Krabs: Why? 
Squidward: It was rated "ARRGH!" [laughing] "Arrgh!" Because it's... about... pirates. 
Mr. Krabs: I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's... [scene zooms in on him] ...a robot! 
Squidward: There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you... 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What? What is it, boy? 
SpongeBob: Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad? [pretends to cry] 
Mr. Krabs: Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break. Now get back to work! 
SpongeBob: Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either. 
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much! 
SpongeBob: That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love. 
Squidward: No, wait, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [runs up to the counter again] What is it, SpongeBob?! 
SpongeBob: I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you! [Mr. Krabs makes a blank expression on his face] 
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, Mr. Squidward. 
SpongeBob: [gulps] Squidward? [Mr. Krabs is at his desk writing something when the radio stops working. Radio breaks with electronic breakage sound effect.] 
Mr. Krabs: Aw, me radio died! [takes out the batteries] Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas. [puts the batteries in his back pocket. A bell rings and then Mr. Krabs walks over to a pot of boiling water] Me hard-boiled egg is ready! [picks up a pair of tongs] I can already taste it. Come to Papa. [takes the egg out of the water with his tongs] Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt? [picks up a salt shaker] 
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: [breaks the egg and accidentally tosses the full salt shaker into his eyes, then proceeding to scream in pain] OH, MY EYES!!!! [continues screaming] 
SpongeBob: Mr...! [Squidward puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth] 
Squidward: Will you be quiet?! Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like? 
SpongeBob: Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries. 
Squidward: Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?! 
Mr. Krabs: [Barges out; his eyes are piercing red, his pair of the tongs snip, then it shows the batteries in his pocket] AHHHH! AHHHH!! AHHH!!! AHHH!!!! OHH!!! AHHHH!! AHH! AHHH!! AHHH!!! AAAAHHHHH!!!! AAAHH! 
SpongeBob &amp; Squidward: AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Mr. Krabs: [continues screaming as he goes into the bathroom] 
Squidward: I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy! 
SpongeBob: [runs over to the phone] Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy! 
Operator: Hello. You've reached the Navy's automated phone service. 
SpongeBob: Squidward! The robots are running the Navy! 
Squidward: NOT THE NAVY!!!! [over loudspeaker] Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! [everyone is silent] Our world! [all the customers run out screaming] What do we do now? 
SpongeBob: I don't know! [notices a nickel] Hey, a nickel! [he points at it] 
Squidward: SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob: Sorry. 
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the bathroom, his eyes back to normal] Ah, that's better. [walks back to his office] Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop. 
Squidward: We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how? 
SpongeBob: Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot. 
Squidward: They poop on the robot? 
SpongeBob: Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information. 
Squidward: I never thought I'd say this but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! [grabs the book titled “How To Torture” and reads it with SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs some rope while Squidward grabs a hammer and a saw. SpongeBob also grabs some old comedy records. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' office, where SpongeBob &amp; Squidward enter] 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hello, boys. [they are at the door with angry expressions on their faces] What can I do for you? [SpongeBob &amp; Squidward lock the door] Heh-heh, why did you lock the door? [nervously as they slowly and menacingly approach him] Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?! [shot of outside the Krusty Krab where loud crashing and everyone screaming can be heard. Back in the office, Squidward ties Mr. Krabs to his office chair] SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!
Squidward: Shut up! [slaps Mr. Krabs] 
Mr. Krabs: Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?! 
Squidward: I said [slaps him again] "shut up!," you bucket of bolts! 
SpongeBob: I can't take it! [runs off, crying] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you okay? 
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch! 
Squidward: No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs. [Mr. Krabs is trying to get out of his chair] 
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. 
Squidward: And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know. 
SpongeBob: Right. [runs up to Mr. Krabs and then slaps him] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first. 
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear? [slaps him again] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, let me handle this. [turns a light on Mr. Krabs] Where's Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs: [confused] What are you talkin' about? I'm Mr. Krabs. [Squidward slaps him again] 
Squidward: We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!
SpongeBob: This is one stubborn robot.
Mr. Krabs: [confused, then angrily yells] WHAT?! [his yelling knocks over the light and SpongeBob] You think I'm a ROBOT?!?!
Squidward: We don't think; we know.
Mr. Krabs: That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: [walks over to SpongeBob] He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.
SpongeBob: I got an idea. [pokes Squidward's nose] Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robo tricks. [runs out and returns later] If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will. [holds up a blender]
Squidward: SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender. 
SpongeBob: Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his "little buddy."
Squidward: Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.
Squidward: We're just gonna see what your "little buddy" knows. [SpongeBob sets the blender on Mr. Krabs' desk. Squidward holds up a bat]
Mr. Krabs: [panicking] No, wait! What are you going to do to me blender?! That cost me money!
Squidward: Where's Mr. Krabs? [shot of the blender] Not talking, eh? [breaks the blender with the bat]
Mr. Krabs: NOOOO! That cost me $24.95! 
SpongeBob: I guess it didn't know anything.
Squidward: Go get the toaster. [SpongeBob gets the toaster then puts it on Mr. Krabs' desk]
Mr. Krabs: No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50! [Squidward breaks the toaster and then SpongeBob sets a food processor on the desk] $62.67! [Squidward breaks it with the bat. SpongeBob picks up a coffee maker and puts it on the desk] Four... well, actually, that one was a gift. [Squidward breaks it] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
SpongeBob: [while trying to put the cash register on Mr. Krabs' desk] This is the last robot, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator. [crying] No! [sobbing and then sobbing louder]
Squidward: I thought you said robots can't cry.
SpongeBob: I also said they couldn't love.
Mr. Krabs: [crying] I loved it like it was me own.
SpongeBob: Uh, at least he's not laughing. 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share! [sobbing]
Squidward: SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?
SpongeBob: The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their... [slows down, as he realizes his mistake] imagination. [chuckles nervously, timpani noise, as if he anticipates Squidward to be angry at him, then checks his watch] Hey, it's time to feed Gary. [runs out while Squidward smiles nervously at Mr. Krabs and then grabs a broom and sweeps the broken pieces on the floor. Mr. Krabs becomes infuriated, the scene then exits from the office to the exterior of The Krusty Krab outside.]
Mr. Krabs: [Growling, starting the background shaking] SQUIDWARD!!!


SpongeBob: [reads the newspaper while sipping a drink] Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.
Gary: [sitting at the counter] Meow.
SpongeBob: [puts on his hat] Well, time to punch that clock.[walks into his living room] But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.[calendar reads "June 21"] You are a winner.[hugs himself then looks back at the calendar and gasps] And today's the first day of summer![cut to the Krusty Krab where the bored Squidward is at the register. SpongeBob walks through the doors with a pink flower around his head. He tosses flower petals into the air]Happy first day of summer, Squidward![walks over to Squidward] Care to join me for solstice caroling?[sings in a high voice]Walking in the grass,it's so fine,don't need shoesin the summertime![tosses flower petals at Squidward]
Squidward: I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: [does a few back flips in the air] Whee-hoo! [runs over to the window]
SpongeBob: [walks up to him] Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever! [turns around] What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?
Mr. Krabs: The money!
SpongeBob: The money?
Mr. Krabs: Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!
SpongeBob: Oh.
Mr. Krabs: You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break. [sits down on a barrel and SpongeBob sits on his lap]
SpongeBob: Tell me more about summer break. [a school bell rings and all the kids run out of the school]
Mr. Krabs: Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance. [a child runs by with a full pocket of coins] Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever. [pulls down a menu] I guess that's what I like best. [puts a sticker labeled '4.99' next to the Kiddie Meal] Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal. [goes over to the front window] Come here, you little piggies!
SpongeBob: I've been taught the true meaning of summer.
Narrator: Later... [Mr. Krabs is still standing at the window with the same expression on his face]
SpongeBob: [walks up] Almost closing time, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs: What? But that's impossible. [sobs] What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children? [SpongeBob shrugs as Mr. Krabs sighs] I guess summer isn't coming this year.
SpongeBob: Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there. [points at a playground where kids are playing]
Mr. Krabs: Playground? Luring away me young customers? Warm up the boat, SpongeBob. [cut to the playground. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs pull up in their boat. They peek out using a pair of binoculars]
SpongeBob: See anything, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob. [two kids are swinging] So weak and malnourished. [one of the kids is eating a lollipop] With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing. [a kid slides down a slide] Breaks me heart. [cries] No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
Mr. Krabs: True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do. [drives off]
SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey! [cut to SpongeBob walking to the Krusty Krab] Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment. [stares at something in the distance] Huh? [a group of kids are lined up at the Krusty Krab where a sign reads "Krabby Land" is hanging. A giant sheet is covering some sort of area. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [sticks the hammer in his belt] You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!
SpongeBob: Krabby Land, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, Krabby Land! [holds up a sign] Where a kid can have fun... for the right price. [laughs] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?
Monroe: Monroe.
Mr. Krabs: Nice to meet you, Monroe. [picks him up and laughs]
Monroe: Whee!
Mr. Krabs: [shakes Monroe and hears change in his pocket] Mmm... a-ha! [his pupils become dollar signs] Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land! [the kids cheer] Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.
Kids: We promise.
Mr. Krabs: All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land! [pulls off the sheet that covered the play area]
Kids: Yeah! [kids' cheers soon turn into frowns and shocked expressions. The play area is a bunch of cheap rides that break down. Tyler tries a slide but it collapses as he tries it]
Tyler: Whoa! Ooh, where am I?
Mr. Krabs: Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability waivers! [holds up a stack of paper] Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!
Kids: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties. [holds up a Krabby Patty] Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.
Kids: We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!
SpongeBob: [while kids are chanting "We want Krabby" eight times] Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.
SpongeBob: Stall 'em? How do I do that?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. Be entertaining. [leaves]
SpongeBob: [turns around and sees the kids, angry; he laughs nervously and waves] Hey, kids!
Monroe: You're not Krabby the Clown.
SpongeBob: No, I'm not. I'm, uh... [puts on a mask] I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!
Tyler: Lame.
SpongeBob: Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles? [picks up a bubble wand]
Monroe: No.
SpongeBob: Well, you've never seen my bubbles. [blows a jellyfish bubble] Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?
Tyler: Still lame. [bubble pops]
SpongeBob: [dips wand again] Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins. [blows a seahorse bubble] Ta-da! [Tyler pops the bubble] Uh... huh.
Kids: You stink! Bring on the clown!
SpongeBob: Okay, uh... and now for a finale! [starts blowing a bubble]
Kids: Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!
SpongeBob: [the bubble pops in his eyes making it red. He screams] My eyes! [scream and trips over a barrel] Whoa! [crashes into The Pit of Doom which is actually a dumpster then swings over a tire. Lands in a pool of bowling balls then the tire lands on him. Kids start to laugh SpongeBob then begins to think...] [Inner Monologue] They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery. [Normal speech] Hey, kids, check this out. [picks up his bubble wand and dips it in the bubble soap then throws the wand away. Pours all the bubble soap in his eyes which swell up and he screams]
Kids: Woo-hoo!
SpongeBob: I got 'em right where I want 'em. [SpongeBob puts a piece of tape on his face and rips it off, revealing a portion of his face is missing and he screams]
Kids: Woo-hoo! Yeah!
SpongeBob: [lies on the ground with his tongue sticking out. A truck runs over his tongue over and over and he screams]
Kids: Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha! [SpongeBob walks up to a muscular guy and hands him some money. The muscular guy hits him with a big hammer. SpongeBob gives the thumbs up] Yeah, woo! [muscular guy smashes SpongeBob with a wrecking ball] Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gives a thumbs-up. Later, SpongeBob is tied to two poles with a muscular guy holding a can of lima beans; screams as muscular guy shoves a spoonful of lima beans in SpongeBob’s mouth. All the kids cheer]
Kids: [laughing]
SpongeBob: [being used as a ball in the two muscular guys' ping pong game] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Kids: Yay! [SpongeBob’s arms are getting stretched by two muscular guys] Yeah! [SpongeBob is in two pieces but gives two thumbs up. Cut to Mr. Krabs' office where he is counting the money he has received from the kids. SpongeBob enters his office in pieces]
SpongeBob: Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
Mr. Krabs: Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?
SpongeBob: The kids are using them as... boomerangs. [one of SpongeBob’s legs flies in and back out]
Mr. Krabs: Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!
SpongeBob: What are we gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!
SpongeBob: [hops on top of the table] Really? He's here? [bounces up and down] Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
Mr. Krabs: Get out there and tell 'em!
SpongeBob: [walks outside] Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!
Kids: Yay!
SpongeBob: Who do you want?
Kids: Krabby!
SpongeBob: When do you want him?
Kids: Now! Krabby, Krabby, Krabby! [all running up to Mr. Krabs] Krabby! Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?
Kids and SpongeBob: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: All right, here you go! [turns around with a blue nose and tie on] Hey, kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties! [laughs and walks back toward his office, leaving the children including SpongeBob shocked and puzzled] Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!
SpongeBob: I'll say you have.
Mr. Krabs: [turns around] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [frowning while almost in tears] How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, I ain't cheap! [takes off his fake nose and rubs the blue paint off it] Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.
SpongeBob: But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?
Mr. Krabs: [walks to the window] The children? I don't care about the children! [starts to climb out the window] I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose! [climbs out] Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest. [laughs]
Kid: Ahem.
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [angry children are standing behind him] Oh, hey kids. [smiles nervously] Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.
Monroe: Get him! [all the kids run after him]
SpongeBob: [inside, sounds of Mr. Krabs getting beat up by the kids is heard as SpongeBob sighs] I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.
Squidward: You mean this morning?
SpongeBob: Yeah. [a noise is heard outside]
Monroe: Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!
Kids: [money is falling from the sky] Yay! Hooray!
SpongeBob: Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.
Kids: Hooray! [a kid on top of the Krusty Krab is throwing money down]
SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.
Mr. Krabs: [is tied to poles like SpongeBob was earlier] Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff! [a muscular guy places a spoon of lima beans in front of him] No! Not that green stuff! [a lima bean truck backs up] Noooooooooo!


[Episode begins in front of the Bikini Bottom Jail. It is thunderstorming badly]
Frank: …and this is the maximum security level. Since this is your first day, I'll let you peek at our number one inmate. [He begins to whisper… The police officers walk into a huge room that the floor is just a thin line and a huge jail cell in the middle of it] He's too dangerous to let him around the other inmates.
Police Officer: Why? What he'd do? Rob a bank?
Frank: Worse! He'd tried to steal the Krabby Patty formula.
Police Officer: Oh! Oh-kay.
Frank: So that's why we keep him behind these impenetrable 6-inch steel doors. [knocks on the door and the door opens] Of course, it helps to lock it. [They both run into the cell] He's gone! He's so small, he could be anywhere!
Police Officer: He could be right under our noses! [cut to Frank's mustache; the mustache then jumps off of Frank's face, running away] Umm… Frank, where's your mustache?
[Cut to outside of the jail, with the siren sound heard and spotlights everywhere. The mustache run through the halls and then under the door. Plankton pops off the mustache.]
Plankton: Ha-ha! Those fools will never find me now! [cut to the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is talking to Karen] Ah, come on, baby. You know how long I've been in stir.
Karen: Get out! [kicks Plankton out of the Chum Bucket] And stay out! You two time loser!
Plankton: After everything I've done for you!
Karen: BEAT IT, YOU JAIL BIRD, AND TAKE ALL OF YOUR JUNK, TOO! [Kicks out a box of his stuff out of the Chum Bucket too. Plankton tries to struggle out under the box]
Plankton: Well, that's just great. [notices his Electric Guitar] Hey! It's my old guitar. I used to play it when I was in that band as a kid. Man, those were good times. [A flashback starts and it shows Plankton in a 2 year old bedroom, with his electric guitar and a drum set. Plankton pretends to play band with his stuffed animals] Okay, everybody! One two… one two three! [Baby Plankton tries to play it and the rest of them do nothing, as they were stuffed animals. His cocoa falls over and Plankton feels annoyed. Then the flashback ends] You know, I don't think I've had any good times.
SpongeBob: [walks on the street behind Plankton, singing a song] ♪Oh, I wish I was grinding up the Krabby Patties. That's what I really love to do. Take a couple Boo-Ooh-Ooh! And a pinch of Awoogah! A teaspoon of *raspberry*♪ [Gibberish] ♪Then I mix some of this and put it over there, as I write this song.♪
Plankton: [right after the "Then I mix some of…" line] He's singing about the Krabby Patty. If I could just get him to explain that song, I'll have the Krabby Patty formula!
SpongeBob: ♪Mix in some…♪
Plankton: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: ♪Nyah-Nyah-Nyah♪
Plankton: That's a real nice song.
SpongeBob: ♪Add a splash of wee…♪
Plankton: But could you explain those "wee" parts?
SpongeBob: [takes out giant knife] ♪And when I'm done, I chop up some… Love.♪
Plankton: [right after the "I chop up some…" line] Gahh! [runs from the knife being tossed on the ground after the song ends] Are you out of your mind? Er, I mean, that was a delightful song you were singing.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Plankton. [waves at Plankton] Mr. Krabs makes me censor out all the patty ingredients from my lyrics.
Plankton: Oh, that's terrible. Krabs shouldn't stifle a true artist like you! Go ahead and sing your patty song uncensored!
SpongeBob: [gasps] I know what you're doing!
Plankton: What, me? I'm not trying to steal the patty formula!
SpongeBob: [points at Plankton] You want me to… join your band!
Plankton: What band? I don't have a band.
SpongeBob: Oh, but you can't fool me! Not when you got an awesome guitar like that! And only a true rocker would have hair as greasy and nasty as yours. It'll be so cool! We could write songs together!
Plankton: Songs? [smiles with a brilliant idea] Yes! And you could teach me your Krabby Patty songs!
SpongeBob: Yay! Come on, let's go get our band together!
[cut to in front of Squidward and SpongeBob's houses. SpongeBob is holding Plankton's guitar and Plankton is on it. SpongeBob and Patrick start yelling in excitement]
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I've got big news!
Patrick: Me, too! Me, too!
SpongeBob: What's your news?
Patrick: [Both calm down] I found out where boogers come from. [Whispers into SpongeBob's ears indistinctly, and tells him where they come from. SpongeBob is shocked, but then is a little grossed out]
SpongeBob: Ew, really?
Patrick: [Nods in agreement] Uh-huh. What's your news?
SpongeBob: Plankton just asked me to join his Rock-N-Roll band! [gets excited again, and asks Plankton] Can Patrick join our band?
Plankton: Sure, whatever.
SpongeBob: Hear that, Patrick? You're in.
Patrick: All right! I play a mean belly. [Starts playing to the tune of "The William Tell Overture," playing his belly to create a timpani solo. It ends, and he bows at Plankton and SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, we're gonna be famous! [hugs Patrick while still holding onto the guitar, and they hear Squidward laughing. Squidward walks towards them and talks]
Squidward: Give me a break. You don't know anything about music! Too bad you're not a musical genius, like me.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward… [trips Squidward over by holding his legs down on the ground]
Squidward: What the…
SpongeBob: Would you help us by joining our band?
Squidward: [gets up] Well, I could help you, but I wouldn't soil my art playing Rock-N-Roll; dressing all in black, wearing boots covered in spikes… [as he continues, he imagines that it's worth it, and slowly changes his mind] playing enormous stadiums filled with screaming, adoring fans… [Squidward smiles to the idea] clapping, demanding encores, cheering me… [He imitates cheering, stops after a few seconds] Oh, uh, changed my mind. I'll join your band and help you bottom feeders… [bursts out rest of the line] But I gotta get in shape first! [leaves everyone]
SpongeBob: Isn't this great, Plankton? Squidward is gonna help us!
Plankton: Hmm? Uh, yeah, great. [Bubble transition. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick in SpongeBob's garage. We see SpongeBob in an 80's Rock-N-Roll outfit, with an afro wig]
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, being in a band gives you the liberty to dress with a little more… Uh, how should I put this?
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Well, with just a little more…
Patrick: [Furious] Go ahead, say it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You know, pizzazz!
Patrick: [Clears throat and continues] Perhaps you didn't notice… My new hairdo.
SpongeBob: [looks behind him and Patrick has a ponytail hairstyle] Whoa-ho-ho, I stand corrected!
Patrick: And unlike your nasty, little wig… [pulls off SpongeBob's wig] Mine is real! [shows it by pulling it and it doesn't come off]
SpongeBob: Man, how'd you grow that so fast?
Patrick: Natural talent, watch this… [shows that he can make his hair come in and out of his skin and make it in any hairdo he wants]
SpongeBob: Whoo, yeah! [claps] Dig that fancy follicle work!
Patrick: Hey, check this one out. [does the trick again, but this time, he makes it an "old guy's" hairdo]
SpongeBob: Oh, man, Squidward's not gonna want to miss this. [calls Squidward]
Squidward: Hello?
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. Aren't you coming to band practice?
Squidward: [seen exercising on his weightlifting bench] Are you kidding? I've got a lot of work to do before I'm famous! [attempts to lift the weight, but breaks an unknown part, then a dial tone is heard, and Squidward screams in pain]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay, then, we'll keep your seat warm. [closes the phone] Patrick?
Patrick: I'm on it. [blows a fire under a seat to keep it warm]
Plankton: [enters the garage, carrying a box] Greetings, fellow band-mates.
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton, what's that?
Plankton: [puts the box down] T-shirts.
Both: Ooh! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! [laugh]
SpongeBob: Ah… [confused] "Plankton and the… Patty Stealers"?
Plankton: [Starts to sweat maniacally] Uh, if you guys don't like the name, uh…
SpongeBob: I… LOVE IT! It's kind of vague and mysterious.
Patrick: Can I get mine in pink? [Plankton growls. The scene skips to where they're wearing the shirt and Patrick laughs. Patrick's shirt color matches his skin perfectly] It looks like a tattoo!
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton, can our first song go like this? [makes a loud bass sound] And then turn into one of those songs that goes… [makes a high pitched screech]
Plankton: [covers his ears, and then resumes to his normal attitude] Yes, perfect. Now all we need are the lyrics. You know something personal. Maybe a secret you know, or a favorite recipe, hmm?
SpongeBob: Or… One about my new friend Plankton?
Plankton: Stop it! [growls after SpongeBob stops]
SpongeBob: Or the ventures of wholesome…
Plankton: [clips SpongeBob's lips with a tool] The best kind of lyrics are the ones that are deep and revealing. Something only you know… [coughs] Secret recipe.
Patrick: I once searched for my innermost secrets. All I found was this. [Shows that he is holding his heart]
SpongeBob: [Still muffled] Is that what you mean, Plankton?
[Plankton slaps his head with annoyance. Scene skips to later that day when Plankton pulls a machine into the garage, grunting as he pulls it]
SpongeBob: What is that?
Plankton: It's my… uh… recording equipment. [Laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: [Excited] Oh, my gosh! What do I do?
Plankton: [scoots a chair next to SpongeBob] Just take a seat here, and I'll strap you in. [SpongeBob sits down, Plankton straps SpongeBob's arms on the chair and puts a pair of headphones on SpongeBob] Now just relax and let the equipment do its job. [The machine starts to beep and make sucking noises. SpongeBob's brain is seen going through the headphone wire into the machine] Now, let's see what's locked in his subconscious. [The machine makes static crackles. When Plankton finds a "station" on the radio, SpongeBob is the speaker. SpongeBob sings songs just like a radio]
SpongeBob: [in tune with "Oh My Darlin' Clementine"] ♪Time to feed him. Time to feed him. Now it's Gary's feeding time. Mrow mrow meow, mrow mrow meow.♪
Plankton: Nope. [turns the tune button]
SpongeBob: [in tune with "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"] ♪Brush, brush, brush my teeth. Gently keep them clean.♪
Plankton: The Krabby Patty Formula's gotta be in here somewhere. [The machine makes a dead beeping noise and feedbacks noises to Plankton. He smacks the machine] What's going- [Screams only to realize that Patrick is wearing the headphones, groaning, and the machine explodes. Plankton starts crying] I'm a failure.
SpongeBob: Cheer up, Plankton. We've still got a whole week before our first gig at the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: [stops crying] At the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh, but old man Krabs doesn't want us bugging the customers. So, we have to go in after hours when nobody's there.
Plankton: When nobody's there? [makes a purring noise with drool coming out of his mouth at the thought of it]
[The scene is skipped to where they start practicing. SpongeBob is playing Plankton's guitar, Patrick is doing his drums, and Plankton, not very excited, plays only one note on his mini-keyboard. The scene cuts to outside in front of Squidward and SpongeBob's houses, then the scene cuts to Squidward exercising. He makes one more and he has huge muscles]
Squidward: My perfect dream-body. [runs out of his house with his bass guitar and goes into SpongeBob's house to practice. They then make noises that sound like they're practicing, causing SpongeBob's house to dance]
Narrator: One week later…
[Cut to the street where the four are heading towards the Krusty Krab at nighttime. They're all wearing their Rock-N-Roll outfits. From a distance, a tire screeching sound is heard, and the noise is later revealed to be from a police car]
Plankton: Oh, no, it's the cops. I can't let them see me!
SpongeBob: Why?
Plankton: Why? Uh, cops are autograph hounds. Yeah, they're always after me.
SpongeBob: Mm, that's tough. Don't worry, I'll hide you. [Sucks Plankton into his nose. The police car stops in front of them]
Officer John: Hey, what are you kids up to this late at night?
SpongeBob: We're on our way to our first gig. We're in a band.
Officer John: A band, huh, well, that's, uh… Oh. [notices a green thing on SpongeBob's nose] Uh, you've got a, uh…
SpongeBob: Got a, uh, what? [laughs]
Officer John: Uh… It's right… [points to a nostril on his face]
SpongeBob: Yes? [Laughs again]
Officer John: [motions to wipe it off. Something, which is actually Plankton's legs, comes out] Just keep your nose clean, kid. [leaves]
SpongeBob: Sure thing, officer. [blows his nose, and blows out Plankton] They're gone.
Plankton: You will never speak of this to anyone. [Scene skips to in front of the Krusty Krab.] Come on, come on, hurry up.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, I just need to get the key out. [hums while opening the door, but fails twice to get the key in the key hole. Plankton grabs the key]
Plankton: Give me that, you incompetent fool. [opens the door and drops the key on the ground, then goes on the ground] Yes, the Krabby Patty Formula's mine! Uh, I mean, we'll have a great time! [goes inside and whispers to himself] Now where does Krabs keep that formula?
SpongeBob: [screams as he goes inside] Whoo, let's rock!
Patrick: Yeah!
Squidward: We're gonna be stars!
[The three enter the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob hooks up the speaker set. Plankton is nowhere to be seen]
SpongeBob: [Starts out by acting all excited like a rock stars] All right! Squidward, are you ready?
Squidward: [makes a loud bass guitar strum] I'm ready!
SpongeBob: Okay! Patrick, are you ready? [Patrick answers by laughing while beating his belly] Plankton, are you ready? [Crickets are chirping in the background] Plankton? [Plankton is carrying a bottle containing the formula. SpongeBob gasps] PLANKTON! [The bottle is broken as SpongeBob says Plankton's name in the mic loudly. The formula is shown to the audience, but all of it is in gibberish]
Plankton: Uh… I'm ready?
SpongeBob: Wait a minute… Was this band just a front so you could steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula?
Plankton: What? No, I was in it for the music, man!
[The camera changes to outside the Krusty Krab and twelve police cars circle around the Krusty Krab. The scene cuts back to the Bikini Bottom Jail. Plankton, in a caged box, sighs]
Plankton: Well, at least I'm back to my old cell.
Police Officer: Oh, no, you're not. We've got a special cell for you. [Frank moves a small painting out of the way, unlocks a safe, and both of them put Plankton in there]
Plankton: But I liked my old cell.
Police Officer: Then you're gonna love this one. [closes the cell]
SpongeBob: [Opens the small window on the other side of Plankton's cell, and only SpongeBob's eye is seen through] There's no time to waste, Plankton. [Plankton looks outside, then the scene cuts to the yard outside, with SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward being there] We've only got 22 years to practice before our next gig. A one and a two…
[Plankton screams in agony]

 
Narrator: It is a cold and windy day, and Bikini Bottom is covered with goosebumps.
Squidward: Oh, it's freezing in here!
SpongeBob: Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. My buns are nice and toasty. [turns around to show two Krabby Patties on his butt]
Squidward: I'm so glad I don't eat here. [SpongeBob, Squidward, and the Krabby Patties shiver as a gusty wind blows through again] Oh, how cold does Krabs keep this place, anyway? [looks at the thermostat to show 62°] 62 degrees?! Oh, that cheapskate! I'm going to set it to a toasty 63. [turns it to 63° but an alarm goes off] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: [hears alarm, bursts down his door] WHO TOUCHED ME THERMOSTAT?!?!?! [everyone, including SpongeBob points at Squidward]
Squidward: [at SpongeBob] Oh, thanks a-- [Mr. Krabs grabs him by the nose]
SpongeBob: You're welcome, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, you're always going on about your book club. Read this.
Squidward: [reads sign above thermostat] "Do not touch thermostat ever." [Mr. Krabs puts the temperature back on 62°]
Mr. Krabs: Heat costs money! There are two ways to get on my bad side, boys. I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat!
Squidward: That's totally selfish!
SpongeBob: Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now!
Mr. Krabs: What?! [kids are playing ball, flying kites and jumping rope in Mr. Krabs front yard] Hey, you kids get off of my lawn! [Mr. Krabs runs out of the restaurant. Plankton is watching all of this through a straw]
Plankton: That's right. Run, Krabs. For I have found your Achilles heel. I'll freeze you out of business and I'll do it with your precious thermostat! [laughs maniacally until an alarm goes off] What the--? Oh, no! Code red! Abandon ship!! Abandon ship! [Plankton screams as Old Man Jenkins sucks him through the straw and into his belly] No matter. In four to six hours, I will have my revenge. [laughs manically]
[Mr. Krabs flips the sign to CLOSED, which means closing time after their work day. SpongeBob and Squidward wait as Mr. Krabs locks the doors]
Squidward: I'm going to go recover from hypothermia.
SpongeBob: Hippo what-ia? What does that mean?
Mr. Krabs: It means he's a big fat crybaby.
Old Man Jenkins: [flushes the toilet and walks to the doors but can't get out] Locked in again.
Plankton: That crusty old barnacle might keep me from the secret formula, but I'd like to see him serve a Krabby Patty when I'm done with this place. [turns on sink faucet] Into every life, a little rain must fall, Krabs! It's just business. [opens up the freezer] Well, maybe it is personal. [turns down the thermostat to –15°] I'm touching your thermostat! I'm touching your thermostat! [cut to Mr. Krabs house where he is sleeping]
Mr. Krabs: Someone—touching—thermostat. [cut to next day with Squidward and SpongeBob walking to work]
Squidward: I might need to bring a sweater. It's colder than yesterday.
SpongeBob: That's why I wore mittens. [close-up of SpongeBob wearing a tiny mitten on each eyelash] Mm, toasty!
Squidward: Huh? [The Krusty Krab is frozen]
Mr. Krabs: Morning, boys! [taps the frozen lock with his key] Lock's a bit sticky this morning. [the key breaks a hole in the frozen lock, opens doors to see the whole place frozen] Is it cold in here, or is it just me? Well, get to work. [goes into his office]
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs! [slips and slides all over the place, including into Squidward] Pardon me! [Squidward slides into Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: All right, quit clowning around and get to work.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir!
Squidward: As long as you turn the heat up!
Mr. Krabs: [points to a poorly-taped piece of paper reading "62°" obscuring the actual temperature display] The temperature stays at 62 degrees.
Squidward: There's icicles hanging from the ceiling!
Mr. Krabs: I don't care if Santie Claus and Jack Frost are having ice cream cones! Don't... touch... THE THERMOSTAT! [icicles fall down and SpongeBob and Squidward run]
Plankton: [spying the still-frozen Krusty Krab through his telescope, while The Chum Bucket has a sign that says "72° Warm!"] I knew you'd be too stubborn to turn the heat up. Let's see how long you keep those customers when you give them the cold shoulder. [customers are waiting for food but Squidward can't move with a tray of Krabby Patties in his hand]
Mr. Krabs: Quit your lollygagging and get a move on! [gives Squidward a forceful push; Squidward slips and falls, tossing the patties off the plate, splattering on the icy floor and onto Squidward's body.]
Squidward: [weakly] Order up.
Martin: Let's get out of here.
Plankton: Yes, flee that frozen wasteland! Warmth and joy have left your lives! [his giant telescope looks at a fish walking by] Hey, buddy, you want to eat at The Chum Bucket? [Jimmy runs off screaming] Fine! At least Krabs' place is deserted. Hey! The customers are coming back! [customers are walking into the Krusty Krab with warmer clothes on] I don't understand! What's bringing them back? [SpongeBob is skating on frozen patties] What the--?!
Mr. Krabs: Just put those patties back when you're done!
SpongeBob: Can do, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: I'm really glad I don't eat here.
SpongeBob: Order up!
Frankie: Where's my food? [patty enters his mouth] Mm. [other patties enter everyone else's mouths]
Old Man Jenkins: I want my Krabby Flabby!
SpongeBob: Coming right up, sir! [SpongeBob hits a patty off of Squidward's behind and into Old Man Jenkins' mouth, sending him into the wall and sliding onto the floor]
Old Man Jenkins: Delicious! [everyone cheers]
Abigail Marge:  Wow, that looks like fun. I'll have two Krabby Patties, but don't cook them.
Jimmy: I'll have two frozen Krabby Patties, too.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir!
Clay: I want Patty skates!
Man: I need two patties, now!
Mr. Krabs: It's beautiful. I'm selling twice as many patties and I don't even have to cook 'em! This is the happiest, and most cost-effective day of me whole life. [hugs all the money]
Plankton: NOOOO!!! How is this possible?! I freeze his place solid and he turns it into an ice rink! He's making more money than ever!
Karen: That's because, unlike you, he's a good businessman.
Plankton: Well, if it isn't the wind beneath my wings.
Karen: I don't understand why you don't just steal a Krabby Patty in all that confusion.
Plankton: I'll be right back. [chuckles]
Karen: I don't know why I encourage him. [inside The Krusty Krab, people are ice skating, playing hockey and riding the clamboni]
Mr. Krabs: This is fantastic! The local hockey team is paying me to practice here!
SpongeBob: Coming through! [skates by Patrick, who has his tongue stuck to the pole] Hi, Patrick!
Patrick: [mumbles] Hi, SpongeBob. [Gary, dressed as a referee, blows his whistle and throws the patty in the air. it hits the ground but slides towards the door]
Hockey Player #1: Where'd the puck go? [SpongeBob squints his eyes to see Plankton carrying the patty]
SpongeBob: Holy shrimp! Plankton! [flickers tongue in a battle cry]
Plankton: I did it! I finally got a Krabby Patty! [SpongeBob puts his spatula down to block Plankton]
SpongeBob: Not quite, Plankton. You'll have to get past me first.
Hockey Player #1: There's the puck! That little square guy has it!
Hockey Player #2: Get him! [SpongeBob tries to scurry but the hockey team tackles him. the other hockey player slapsticks the patty]
SpongeBob: You're mine now, Plankton! [patty flies into his face] You won't get away with this, Plankton!
Plankton: Hey, SpongeBob. long time, no see. What've you been up to? How was your weekend?
SpongeBob: Oh, my weekend was fabulous! Thank you for asking. Patrick and I went jellyfishing but I lost my net. So, I tried to borrow one from Squidward, but he didn't have one. And then when he yelled at me, he swallowed a bug! [laughs] Swallowed a bug.
Plankton: Fascinating. Well, got to go. [takes patty and runs]
SpongeBob: Hey!
Plankton: Better luck next time, SpongeBob!
Hockey Player #3: There's the puck, eh? Get it!
Plankton: Uh-oh. [runs] Whoa! [Squidward skates by and dances in a yellow leotard. SpongeBob skates by him, he gets angry. the hockey team skates by him and runs him over]
SpongeBob: Hold it right there, mister! [two hockey players run into SpongeBob. Plankton tries running away again but gets hit by a hockey stick again. SpongeBob tries to get the patty but is getting hit by the hockey team over and over. Squidward is getting run over by everyone. Plankton gets hit towards the door]
Plankton: Yes! I'm gonna make it! [lands in front of the door but when the hockey team and SpongeBob collide with each other, it sends Plankton and the patty into the air then back down]
SpongeBob: Gotcha, Plankton!
Plankton: On the contrary! It is I who has you! [rides the clamboni]
SpongeBob: [gasps] The clamboni! Run for it! [the clamboni runs into him, carrying him along]
Plankton: [laughs maniacally] Run, you fools! Run! [Plankton manages to take along the entire hockey team, SpongeBob, Squidward and Patrick on the clamboni] It's working! I'm actually going to get a Krabby Patty! [clamboni stops because of a huge pile up at the door] Come on, get outta the way! You're blocking the exit! [clamboni breaks down] Noooo! NOOOO! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: I'll take that. [grabs patty] Brilliant idea to block the exit with your body, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Um, thank you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [jumps off the clamboni] You lose again, Plankton!
Plankton: I'm not giving up yet, Krabs. I've still got my secret weapon! [jumps on the thermostat] The thermostat! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps softly] The thermostat?
Plankton: That's right, Krabs. It was I who froze The Krusty Krab. [rips off the paper that says "62°" to reveal -15°] You see?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] You've gone too far this time, Plankton! You can pummel me employees, [punches SpongeBob through the gut] try to destroy me restaurant, but nobody messes with me thermostat. [boxing bell rings as Mr. Krabs hurries over to Plankton but Plankton changes the thermostat to above boiling, making the ice melt. Mr. Krabs drops into the water, then Plankton turns it back to below freezing, which causes Mr. Krabs to freeze, too. The temperature now has -26°, having the numbers mixed up]
Plankton: See, Krabs? You can't defeat me! [turns the thermostat to hot and cold, making everyone freeze, accidentally lets go of the thermostat when its hot and drops into the water. Mr. Krabs walks up to the thermostat and changes it to freezing to turn Plankton into an ice cube. cut to later in the day where the ice rink has turned into a swimming pool for customers. SpongeBob in an inner tube floats to Mr. Krabs in a reclining chair with a Krabby Patty and lemonade in a platter]
SpongeBob: Here's your Krabby Patty and lemonade, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [takes the lemonade, but forgets the Krabby Patty] Thank you, lad. [sees Plankton in one of the ice cubes] Well, well, if it isn't Plankton. You know, I should thank you. What with the ice rink and now the swimming pool gimmick, I'm making more money than I ever did with the old Krusty Krab! Hey, you got any more good ideas? [takes a sip of his lemonade]
Plankton: [screams]


[Open on the Chum Bucket. A clam crows like a rooster. Cut to a close-up of Plankton's face. He has his eye closed, and then slowly opens it to show its veins.]
Plankton: [drearily] And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty. [Gets up and walks to his computer wife, Karen]
Karen: Maybe today will be the day?
Plankton: Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife. [Walks towards the doors of the Chum Bucket]
Karen: Do you even have a plan?
Plankton: Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen? [Bubbles rise, transitions to the Krusty Krab. Plankton walks through the door] I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula... [He slips and falls into a puddle of water]
SpongeBob: Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there. [Plankton tries to get up]
Mr. Krabs: [Walks towards them] Look at you, Plankton. Once again, you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula. [he holds a Krabby Patty in front of his face] Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula. [Plankton tries to bite it, but Mr. Krabs takes it away] And you never will! [laughs] How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure? [he walks away laughing, two customers are watching]
Charlie: [talking to the Nat Peterson next to him, commenting on the wet floor SpongeBob was mopping] There really should be a "Wet Floor" sign.
Nat Peterson: Yeah, if that were me who slipped, I'd sue old man Krabs for all he's got.
Plankton: Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?
Charlie: Of course.
Plankton: [ponders the thought and then falls back and pretends to be injured] Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering.
Mr. Krabs: [bursting through his office's door] Sue?!
Female Customer #1: Oh, that looks bad.
Dennis: Uh-oh.
Nazz: Poor little man.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs enter the frame and look at each other. Transition to ambulance workers pushing Plankton on a gurney]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?
Plankton: Well... if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence.
Mr. Krabs: Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!
Plankton: [laughs menacingly, then points at Mr. Krabs] See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean... [stops pointing] Oh, the pain! The deep-frying pain! [The ambulance workers carry the gurney off and the scene transitions to the inside of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is pacing back and forth, with Squidward and SpongeBob near him]
Mr. Krabs: I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands.
Mr. Krabs: What I really need is a good lawyer.
Richard: Hello, did somebody say "lawyer"? [Holds out his business card] Richard A. Bottomfeeder, Attorney at Law. I couldn't help but notice that despicable display.
Mr. Krabs: So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?
Richard: Actually, I won't charge you a dime unless we win.
[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into American dollar signs]
Richard: In fact, I think we should counter sue for everything Plankton owns.
[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into gold bars. The weight on them makes him fall over]
Richard: [points at Mr. Krabs] Does that happen a lot?
SpongeBob: No, they're usually silver.
[Scene transitions to SpongeBob strolling into Mr. Krabs' office, humming his own credits theme song]
SpongeBob: Um, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What is it, lad?
SpongeBob: I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it.
Mr. Krabs: Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a... [Richard whispers into his ear] of a liability than an asset.
SpongeBob: But I...
Mr. Krabs: Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places. [The lawyer grabs his briefcase and walks outside the door with it]
Richard: Oh, this is going to be a slam-dunk! [he slips and falls on the floor]
SpongeBob: Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!
Richard: [weakly] Wracked...with pain...can't move.
SpongeBob: But what about Mr. Krabs' case?
Richard: Looks like you're going to have to handle this one, son.
SpongeBob: But, I'm a...a liability.
Richard: Everything you need to win... [a part of his body snaps] is in this here case. [shows SpongeBob his briefcase]
SpongeBob: [swipes the case from him] Really? Everything?
Richard: Uh huh. Everything but a suit. [he falls unconscious]
SpongeBob: A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit.
[Scene changes to the Bikini Bottom Court House. Plankton in a wheelchair enters the courtroom and precedes to Mr. Krabs]
Plankton: [whispering] I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula.
Mr. Krabs: [yelling] Never, you little runt! [The court audience gasps]
Plankton: [dramatically] Oww, oww! My wittle arm! [audience gasps]
Mr. Krabs: What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him.
Plankton: Oww! My other arm! [audience gasps]
Mr. Krabs: He's lying! Bah!
[Judge's gavel knocks and the two proceed to their desk]
Tom: Court will come to order. The Honorable Judge Stickleback presiding.
Stickleback: Mr. Krabs, where is your attorney?
Mr. Krabs: [hesitantly] I don't know where he could be.
[The courtroom door bursts open, with SpongeBob standing there in a gray suit, similar to the previous lawyer's]
SpongeBob: Here I am!
Stickleback: Thank you for joining us, Mr...uhh...
SpongeBob: [placing his briefcase on the desk] SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor.
Mr. Krabs: [Through his teeth] What are you doing here, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here [rubs his briefcase] .
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: Yep, right in here. [tries to unlock the briefcase, but he can't]
Mr. Krabs: Is there a problem?
SpongeBob: Umm... your lawyer didn't give me the combination.
Lawyer: Is the plaintiff ready to proceed?
Plankton: Yes, your honor. I'll try. [Moves his wheelchair to the jury box. He "owws" in pain on the way there] I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today. [starts crying] I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell.
[SpongeBob tries to split the briefcase in half, but splits himself. Mr. Krabs leans over]
Mr. Krabs: Pull yourself together, boy.
Plankton: Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: How's it coming, lad?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case. [takes a kitchen knife and tries to pry open the briefcase]
Plankton: Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor [SpongeBob continues with the knife] that had been intentionally [the knife shoots him to the light on the roof] covered with a viscous fluid.
[SpongeBob puts a lamp shade on his head]
SpongeBob: Bombs away! [he drops onto the briefcase like a bomb, but nothing happens. SpongeBob drops off the desk and onto the floor]
Plankton: Ahem! Are you quite finished?
SpongeBob: [nods] Mm-hmm.
Plankton: Now where was I? Oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed. [he cries] I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram! Sorry! [the audience begin to cry] Thank you for your kind attention. [he turns around and, softly] Suckers.
Stickleback: Does the defense... [sniffles] have an opening statement?
SpongeBob: Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!
[transitions to Mr. Krabs on the stand]
Plankton: [presents a "wet floor" sign to Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?
Mr. Krabs: It's a "wet floor" sign.
Plankton: Do you own one?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't. [everyone gasps] No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed... superfluous.
Court Audience: Guilty. Guilty, guilty, guilty.
Plankton: No more questions.
[SpongeBob tries using a screwdriver to open the case]
Stickleback: Your witness, Mr. LawyerPants.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Stickleback: Sometime today, Mr. Pants.
SpongeBob: May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap [Mr. Krabs starts sweating], miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar [takes out a dollar] and dropped it in the blender? [drops the dollar in a blender] [Mr. Krabs gasps. SpongeBob presses the "obliterate" button on the blender. The dollar starts to be shredded]
Mr. Krabs: No! No-no! No! [runs and grabs the blender. He starts grabbing the piece of shredded dollar from the air] Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here. [the jury talks amongst themselves and SpongeBob tries to look innocent] A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain. [he walks off, but then walks back to pick up a stranded piece of dollar] Daddy didn't forget ya.
Stickleback: Does the defense have any witness to call?
SpongeBob: Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand.
Mr. Krabs: [rests in his chair] Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee. [Squidward is up in the stand]
SpongeBob: Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with that ludicrous statement?
Squidward: Yes.
Mr. Krabs: What?!
SpongeBob: Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?
Squidward: Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying? [the jury talks amongst themselves]
Mr. Krabs: [looking scared, he starts taking a nail and hammer and tries to open the briefcase] Must...open...case.
[transition to SpongeBob questioning something else]
SpongeBob: So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it? [he's questioning the mop he was using, it doesn't speak]
SpongeBob: Answer the question! [the jury look at each other questioningly] Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?
Mr. Krabs: I'm doomed.
[Transition to SpongeBob still trying to open the briefcase]
Mr. Krabs: You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you! We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case. [he hits the case. The case then opens up] It's open! [they lift the case]
Mr. Krabs: It's... [shows that the thing inside the briefcase is a Krabby Patty] It's just his lunch. Or is it? [a light bulb moves out of SpongeBob's head and starts glowing]
SpongeBob: Defense calls Plankton to the stand. [Plankton looks surprised; later, on the stand]
SpongeBob: Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?
Plankton: To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?
SpongeBob: Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these? [he shows Plankton a Krabby Patty. Plankton starts licking his lips] Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty...
Plankton: [continuously sweating] Uhh...uhh...uhh [he tries to bite the sandwich, but SpongeBob takes it away. He takes off his fake casts] I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme! [jumps for the sandwich and grabs it, then he runs off with it] Yippee! Finally it's mine!
Mr. Krabs: [grabbing the sandwich from Plankton] I'll take that!
Plankton: Huh? No, no, no!
Mr. Krabs: Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp. [he eats the Krabby Patty]
Plankton: No, no, no, no!
Stickleback: [bangs gavel] Has the jury reached a verdict?
Tom: We have, your honor. We find the defendant not guilty...but he is cheap.
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning.
SpongeBob: That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present.
Mr. Krabs: A present? For me?
SpongeBob: Close your eyes and hold out your hand. [Mr. Krabs does so. SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs a "wet floor" sign with many nails in it. Mr. Krabs grabs it and starts yelling in pain] It's a "wet floor" sign. I made it myself.
Mr. Krabs: Well, it'll do. After all, it's free!


[First scene at Krusty Krab]
Squidward: SpongeBob, one extra large order of sea fries.
SpongeBob: And...
Squidward: Please.
SpongeBob: Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Squidward: Yes. Yes it was.
SpongeBob: [Snaps finger] One large sea fries coming up! [Walks to pick up a bag full of sea taters. Pours them into his holes then walks back. Strains himself and the fries comes out of him and into the fryer. A bonk in the head gets one more out] [fryer dings!] Eeeeeee! [Picks up fries and places them on the container. Gives them to Squidward]
Squidward: One large sea fries. Extra weird.
Mr. Krabs: [A megaphone appears] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob's facial parts fall out] Report to me office.
[Cut to Mr. Krabs's office]
Mr. Krabs: Now listen up, son. I called ye here on the official Krusty Krab business. Every year, me fellow cheapskate crabs meet and discuss new ways of being stinky in the workplace. But more than that, they bestow the award for Cheapest Krab. And this year, [holds up paper] I've been nominated!
SpongeBob: [Reads paper and speaks gibberish]...Krabs...[gibberish]...nominated...[gibberish]...award...award?
Mr. Krabs: So I'll be outta town for the awards ceremony. And yer coming with me.
SpongeBob: Road... trip!
[They exit the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Now, this trip... I'm gonna teach ye all the cheapskate knowledge like you were the son I've never wanted!
SpongeBob: Ooh! Can I call you Daddy?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: Pa?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: Pop?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: Papa?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: My old man?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: Daddy-kins?
Mr. Krabs: Maybe.
SpongeBob: Grampy Joe?
Mr. Krabs: [Slaps his head] Ooh! No! Now, this'll be a great learning experience for you, so keep yer brain peeled!
SpongeBob: [peels his head off, revealing his brain] Can do, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: And in the tradition of the event, we are required to travel cheaply, and I'm gonna teach ya the cheapest way to do it!
[Cut to a hotel where all the cheapskates are meeting. A mailman drops a heavy envelope on the front desk. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob come out]
Mr. Krabs: Attention, cheapskate attendees! I, Eugene Krabs, have only spent on me travel, the price of a one-cent stamp! [The crabs start cheering] Thank you! Thank you! I'd like to see someone top that!
[Suddenly, another crab comes out of a suitcase]
Mr. Krabs: [Gasp] Chintzy McGee?!
Chintzy McGee: Thanks for letting me hitch your ride, Mr. Krabs! I didn't have to spend a penny on travel!
Crabs: Oooh! [One of them says, "Snap!" and snaps his finger]
Chintzy McGee: [To SpongeBob] Better wish him luck, kid. He'll need it. [Leaves]
SpongeBob: Good luck, Mr. Krabs- [Mr. Krabs grabs his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Come on. [Leaves]
[Cut to hotel room door. An employee carries their bags to their hotel room]
Employee: Your room, sir. [Holds out hand]
Mr. Krabs: You see that, laddie? That outstretched hand is one of the biggest dangers to becoming a true cheapskate: [whispers] He wants a tip.
SpongeBob: [Whispers] What's a tip?
Mr. Krabs: It means he wants money for nothing. [pulls out a quarter with a string attached to it] So watch closely. [Drops it on employee's hand] There ye are, lad.
Employee: Wow. A quarter. You, sir, are a real cheapskate.
Mr. Krabs: Why, thank you! [Employee walks away] Now watch closely, boy! You give it a little lean, and then... snatch it back! [pulls on string. The quarter flies away from the employee's hand]
Employee: Oh. Like I haven't seen that gag ten times today. [quarter flies back to Mr. Krabs's hand, who laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Go ahead! Give it a try!
SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir! [pulls out another quarter] Here you are, sonny! A nice, shiny- [turns to see another employee, who is very big and ugly] quarter. [SpongeBob gives it to him, who grapples tightly onto the quarter, then leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Go on, boy! The quarter's getting away!
[SpongeBob pulls the string, but lures the big employee back to him, and squashes him, the big employee gets up, and he is stuck to his butt]
Mr. Krabs: Quit foolin' around! I got an award to win! [He pulls SpongeBob out and leaves]
SpongeBob: My quarter! [the big employee leaves with the quarter stuck to his butt]
[They walk into a room full of cheapskate crabs who are chatting]
Mr. Krabs: Hi, fellers! [He laughs, the crowd laughs, and SpongeBob attempts to laugh like them]
One of the crabs: Ye still know the cheapskate handshake?
Mr. Krabs: Of course. [They start the handshake]
Both: Penny pinchin', penny pinchin'. [They pinch each other's butts, then act like chickens] Cheep cheep cheep! [They peck the ground, then sighed]
Mr. Krabs: I'd like to introduce me fellow fry cook, SpongeBob. I've been giving some pointers.
Crab: Ah! Training in the cheapskate arts, eh? Yer learning from the master, kiddo!
SpongeBob: I cook Krabby Patties.
Crab: Yes. Sure you do. Later, Krocs!
Mr. Krabs: Lad, you're surrounded by stingy wisdom, so try to pick up some pointers. But whatever you do, don't lend anyone money. [He sees SpongeBob lending money to a crab]
SpongeBob: Twenty five, twenty six- [They both see Mr. Krabs. The crab then walks away with the cash]
Mr. Krabs: Let's mangle.
Judge: Attention, penny pinchers! [pinches his claw]
Crabs: [confused, then pinches their claws. Laughter]
Judge: It's time to award the trophy [pulls out trophy] for this year's Cheapest Crab! [The golden trophy shows a claw pinching a penny]
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob sit down to watch a video]
Judge: And the nominees are: Eugene Krabs! In: "Sign of the Times!"
[The video shows Mr. Krabs putting out a "Free Krabby Patties" sign. Audience gasps. customers comes to Krusty Krab. Another sign is put out]
Crowd: "Huh?" "A dollar per footstep?" "I can't afford that!" [they're confused]
Harold: How do I get out of here? [He, along with others, struggle not to walk too much. Mr. Krabs laughs. Applause]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, thank you!
Judge: Next up is Buford Bargain Bottom in: "Convenience Store Caper!"
[Video shows a customer walking to Buford, the cashier, with a bag of chips. Buford scans it three times]
Customer: Uh, you charged me three times.
Buford: Yeah. Three times the flavor, three times the price! [Applause]
Judge: And Dwight T. Wad in: "Tying Up Loose Ends!"
[Video shows Wad tying used toilet paper to a roll of new toilet paper. Applause]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, geez. I didn't think the competition would be so stiff this year! [To SpongeBob] I'm gonna need your help on this one! [Runs to whisper something to the judge]
Judge: Well, that's highly unconventional, but okay. We will now hear a testimony from a Krusty Krab employee! [Mr. Krabs gets SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: I need ya to testify about how cheap I am! So if you need to do a little exaggeratin'... [his eyelids move twice. SpongeBob winks. Mr. Krabs winks four times. wink. two eyelids and a wink. wink] Ye not getting it, are ye? [SpongeBob shakes his head] Exaggeratin' is like tellin' the truth, only with little lies sprinkled in to make it, uh... true...er.
SpongeBob: [Gasp] You're teaching me to lie?! Lying is wrong, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: No, no, no, no, no, no, exaggeratin's completely different from lyin'. You're taking the truth, and just seasoning it with little lies. I mean, just because you put salt on a Krabby Patty... it doesn't make it a salty patty. Does it?
SpongeBob: No. [he is pushed onto the stage]
Mr. Krabs: Well, good enough. Just make sure you exaggerate enough fer me to win! [Throws SpongeBob to the mic]
SpongeBob: [speaks through mic] Um, uh, uh, uh... Mr. Krabs has always been very, uh... very...very red.
Mr. Krabs: [Slap] Exaggerate!
SpongeBob: Blue!
Mr. Krabs: No! About me being cheap!
SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs is... a very generous pointer. [The audience gasps, including Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: No, no, no, no, exaggerate the other way!
SpongeBob: Um, he's not doing it for the money. He is doing it for his loyal employees. [The crabs talk to each other about this] Vacation time, regular raises, profit sharing. To Mr. Krabs, he's such a little gift that he's to glad to give us, so that he can see the looks on our faces when he hands us our paychecks. [Mr. Krabs faints]
Judge: We've heard enough. [pushes SpongeBob away, points to Mr. Krabs on the floor] Disqualified!
[Cut to hotel room. Mr. Krabs is packing up, but also sobbing into his suitcase]
SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs, you left some bitter tears on the night vent.
Mr. Krabs: [Sniff] Thanks. [Puts tears in suitcase]
SpongeBob: Cheer up, Mr. Krabs. You may have not won the award, but you taught this sponge a lot about stinginess. Ooh! I almost forgot to pack these hotel toiletries! [Puts them away] And let's not forget these hotel towels! [Puts them away]
Mr. Krabs: But...but isn't that stealing?
SpongeBob: Stealing? Phhhht! We're exaggerating!
Mr. Krabs: Heh heh. Well, could we "exaggerate" this pillow, too?
SpongeBob: Well, only if you help me "exaggerate" this air conditioner!
Mr. Krabs: Sure, boy! But why not "exaggerate" the whole wall? [They laugh, then start taking the room and its walls apart. They exit with their huge suitcases full of parts of the room] Well, I didn't win the award, but it's been nice exaggeratin' with you, boy. [They laugh again]
[Cut to lobby]
Employee: Do you have any hotel property in this bag?
Judge: Preposterous! This is all mine! [Pats his suitcase, which opens and reveals hotel property. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob pull their bags in]
Mr. Krabs: Heh heh heh. Looks like he bit off more than he could chew. [The bags explode, revealing the hotel room like it was]
Judge: [Gasp] You took the entire hotel room?
SpongeBob: Duh! [Wags finger] Exaggerated! [The crabs give an applause]
Judge: That is the stingiest display I've ever seen. I declare you the new winner! [gives trophy to Mr. Krabs, who laughs] See ye next year! [exits, then pulls on a string. The trophy flies back to him, then he leaves]
Mr. Krabs: [doesn't care and talks to SpongeBob] Thanks for ruinin' everything so I could win! Put er there, SpongeBob, me boy!
SpongeBob: Sure. [holds out hand. SpongeBob holds out his hand, but chopped SpongeBob's hand off.]
SpongeBob: Oops. [They laugh]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob making a Krusty Krab delivery. He rides his unicycle to a local company building and parks it at the parking rack.]
SpongeBob: Delivery! [gets caught in the spinning doors] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! [screams as he is sent flying into the security guard's desk; he gets up and he's dizzy] Delivery. [pops out his eye]
Security Guard: Will you ever learn how to use those doors?
SpongeBob: Never!
[SpongeBob gets up, puts his eye back in his face, and walks over to the elevator. He goes up the elevator and exits it. He enters the office and tries to find which one of the workers ordered the delivery.]
Boss: [comes out from her office] Has anybody seen my delivery? [goes back in]
SpongeBob: Delivery coming!
[SpongeBob takes off his shoe, pulls out a pogo stick and pogoes over the workers. He pogoes onto a worker's keyboard.]
Worker #1: Wow!
[SpongeBob pogoes on another worker's keyboard.]
Nathaniel: Hey!
[SpongeBob pogoes on a worker's head and pogoes over to a skeleton of Davy Jones.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I've heard of this. Davy Jones' cubicle.
[SpongeBob pogoes into the boss's office wall and enters through the door.]
SpongeBob: Your delivery, ma'am. [the bag slips out of his hand] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! [gibbers] Whoa! [gibbers]
[SpongeBob struggles to grab the bag before it falls to the ground. He gets himself tied up in a knot with his arms, but manages to catch the bag with his foot.]
SpongeBob: Whew!
[Suddenly, the bag rips. A Krabby Patty and a milkshake splatter all over the floor.]
SpongeBob: [groans] Oh, no! A delicious Krusty Krab disaster! [goes to scoop the milkshake back in the cup] Call the shore patrol! Get an ambulance! Does anyone know CSR? Chocolate shake resuscitation? [rolls himself over the milkshake stain and gets himself covered with it; he wrings the milkshake into the cup]
Boss: It's alright. Just leave it. [resumes her work]
SpongeBob: [sips the milkshake with a stray from the floor] Here! You can drink it from here! See? [drinks really hard until his sucks the straw into his face; he pulls it off] It's too late. I did all I could, but it wasn't enough. I'll just clean up the remains.
[SpongeBob grabs the boss's files and whips the milkshake stain with them.]
Boss: Enough! Just go. I'm busy.
SpongeBob: In ancient times, one would fall under sword by way of apology. We at the Krusty Krab keep that tradition. [pulls out his spatula, pretends to commit seppuku and falls flat; the boss couldn't care less and SpongeBob gets up] And now that that's out of the way, I am going to give you the Krusty Krab Customer Service Pledge of Satisfaction. [holds up the pledge of satisfaction paper] I pledge to come back here tonight and clean this carpet and make it shine! [opens the doors] As a matter of fact, I'll clean all your offices and all your cubicles. Courtesy of the Krusty Krab. [leaves]
Boss: No need. We have a cleaning robot that does it all at night.
[The scene changes to nighttime. The building is now closed and the security guard prepares to leave for the night.]
Security Guard: [talking through his cellphone] No, Mom. I'm not double-checking that the doors are locked. Stop nagging me. [his phone chatters and he sighs] I love you too. [leaves]
[SpongeBob comes strolling to the building with a cleaning cart. And Patrick is accompanying him for his assistance in completing the task.]
SpongeBob: Thanks for lending me your cleaning cart, Patrick.
Patrick: [gnawing on a broom] Cleaning cart? I thought this was a food cart.
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter, but get caught in the spinning door.]
Both: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Patrick: Best door ever!
[SpongeBob and Patrick fly out from the spinning doors.]
SpongeBob: Hold on!
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the elevator. But a gum wrapper falls onto the floor. The trash robot the boss mentioned about earlier picks up the wrapper.]
Trash robot: Trash. [burns the wrapper and leaves]
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the elevator.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
Patrick: Don't hit anything!
SpongeBob: Look out! Look out!
Patrick: Oh-ho, watch it!
SpongeBob: Look out! Look out!
Patrick: [screams] Paper shredder!
[SpongeBob and Patrick crash into the Shredinator 3000 paper shredder and little pieces of shredded paper fly everywhere.]
Patrick: [gleefully laughs and sticks his tongue out like his catching snowflakes] Those two shreds are alike.
SpongeBob: [covered in shredded paper and looks like a snowman] Let's start here and make our way to the milkshake stain.
[The scene changes to Patrick breaking a watercooler and filling a bucket up with water. He goes into a cubicle and throws water on the computer. The computer sparks. Patrick takes a mop and mops up everything.]
Patrick: [sings while he mops] ♪Working guy, working guy, working guy, working guy.♪
[SpongeBob goes into a stockholder office and uses the blower to blow several papers. He blows the chairs away from the table and blows them out the window. Patrick is scrubbing the ceiling with the floor scrubber. But some of the tiles fall over and crash on the floor. One tile hits a worker, who is working late in his cubicle. He puts a tiny umbrella on his head. The trash robot comes in through the elevator and sees the mess SpongeBob and Patrick made.]
Trash robot: Trash! [examines the big mess] Trash. [picks up the shred with its arms and eats them] Trash. [picks up all of the papers, forms into a ball, eats them, and rolls off] Trash!
[SpongeBob is vacuuming the particles from the floor. Patrick is goofing around, laughing and running all over the place. The vacuum puffs up dust and Patrick fills in pants with it. He floats up and down and goes back to running. He accidentally bumps into a cubicle, which resulted in knocking all of them over like dominoes. One wall falls on the worker.]
Patrick: Can I just say, "Oops?"
SpongeBob: Uh, not a problem. Uh, we'll just put 'em all back up the way they were.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick putting all of the cubicle walls back up.]
SpongeBob: There. Good as new.
[The scene pans out and reveals that SpongeBob and Patrick end up making a maze instead of making them separate cubicles.]
Patrick: Uh, how do we get out of here?
SpongeBob: Uh, maybe this way? [he and Patrick walk to the left, but end up going back to where they started] Oh, uh, or this way.
[The scene shows them digitalized as video game characters and resembles it into a maze game of Pac-Man. SpongeBob and Patrick go into different directions, while the trash robot tracks them.]
SpongeBob: [sees a candy wrapper on the floor] Oh! Missed one.
Trash robot: [grabs the wrapper] Trash!
SpongeBob: Hey, that's mine! I'm cleaning these offices! [snatches the wrapper from the trash robot] Patrick, catch! [throws the wrapper to Patrick]
[Patrick jumps up and eats the wrapper. But he falls onto a desk. The trash robot scans Patrick and finds the wrapper in his stomach.]
Trash robot: Trash! [blazes fire and holds out a sharp blade]
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: Run!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run from the trash robot. The trash robot chases them in hot pursuit. SpongeBob and Patrick climb over a wall. The trash robot slices through it with the blade. SpongeBob and Patrick take cover in the copy room. SpongeBob slips on some papers and crashes into the copier. Patrick goes to pull SpongeBob out, but the trash robot slices through the door. Patrick pulls SpongeBob out and they both run out. The trash robot puts a bandage on the copier.]
Trash robot: Boo-boo.
[The trash robot flares up and chases SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick run down the hall and hide into the kitchen. Patrick crashes into the soda machine and SpongeBob crashes into the coffee maker. SpongeBob removes the coffee pot from his head and gets coffee all over himself.]
SpongeBob: Oh no! I'm bleeding! [licks the coffee] It's okay. It's decaf.
[Patrick groans in pain as he slides off the soda machine.]
Trash robot: Trash, trash, trash.
Patrick: SpongeBob, why is this happening?
Trash robot: [comes in the kitchen] Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash. [scans everything in the kitchen and detects SpongeBob and Patrick as trash] Trash. [SpongeBob and Patrick grin nervously; the trash robot blazes fire over its head] Trash!
SpongeBob: Um, eh. Look you, garbage can thing. I don't know what we did to you, but I made a Krusty Krab pledge to your boss to clean these offices.
[The trash robot wouldn't listen to SpongeBob's pleas and shoots a broom in his mouth. It grabs Patrick and goes to burn him.]
Patrick: Ow! My rump is roasting!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick may be trashy, [Patrick burps] but he's not trash!
[SpongeBob leaps onto the trash robot and fights with it. The trash robot lets Patrick go and flings him into the sink.]
SpongeBob: Ah! Ah! Whoa! Stop that! Whoa! Oh!
[Patrick's butt is cooled off. Patrick takes a spoon and drinks some of the dishwater.]
Patrick: Hmm, Patrick soup.
SpongeBob: Ah! Ah! Whoa! Stop that! Whoa! Oh!
[The trash robot grabs SpongeBob goes to attack him. But SpongeBob retaliates by jumping on its back and make it spit out fire. The trash robot spins rapidly around and hits SpongeBob against the wall several times. They crash into the broom closet where SpongeBob ties up the trash robot.]
SpongeBob: Sorry to do this, but you'll have to stay here until we finish cleaning. [picks up a paper] Here. This should tie you over 'till we're done. [feeds the trash robot the paper]
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the main office.]
SpongeBob: Whew, finally! Patrick, meet the main stain that I disdain.
Patrick: Ha, ha, ha!
SpongeBob: [picks up a cleaner] Oh, what do you know? This cleaner contains saliva enzymes that break down chocolate particles. Hmm. You know if we wanted to, we could just—
[Patrick is licking the stain off the floor with his tongue.]
Patrick: Way ahead of ya!
SpongeBob: Make room!
[SpongeBob joins Patrick in licking the stain off the floor with their tongues. They hear a loud thud, but resume the task. The trash robot breaks free from the broom closet, fixes the copier, and takes control of it.]
Trash robot: Eliminate intruders!
[The copier operates itself and hops away from the outlet. The trash robot then takes control of the coffeemaker, the microwave oven, the pencil sharpener, the paper shredder and and the soda machine. Together, all of the machines march out to destroy SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob continue to lick the stain off the floor, until a drop of coffee falls on his head.]
SpongeBob: Ew. Patrick, stop sweating on me.
Patrick: I ran out of sweat an hour ago. [his dried tongue breaks off]
[Another drop of coffee falls on SpongeBob. They look up and see the coffeemaker dangling on the ceiling with its cord.]
Both: Ahh! Coffee killer!
[The coffeemaker falls from the ceiling and SpongeBob and Patrick run out. A shadow looms in from behind them. They turn and see the trash robot.]
SpongeBob: You again?
[A soda machine rolls next to the trash robot.]
Patrick: Oh, good! Soda! I was getting thirsty again.
[The soda machine shoots soda into Patrick's mouth. The soda machine then shoots various sodas at SpongeBob and Patrick. They both dodge the incoming sodas like dodging bullets.]
SpongeBob: This is not refreshing! [gets soda flung in his eyes and the soda sprays out, making him fall backwards]
[Patrick picks up a soda, shakes it, opens it, and throws it like a bomb. The soda explodes and sends the soda machine crashing into a wall. The wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. The trash robot snaps its fingers. SpongeBob gets grabbed by the copier and closes its lid several times. The copier then copies SpongeBob onto various papers.]
Patrick: Man, you do not take a bad picture! [shows a crude picture of SpongeBob made by the copier]
[The copier spits out SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[SpongeBob flies into the paper shredder and gets shredded up. Patrick opens the shredder and pulls SpongeBob out.]
Patrick: Hang in there, buddy! Hang in there! [grabs a bottle of glue and makes an nearly successful attempt to glue SpongeBob together]
[Patrick goes somewhere and SpongeBob fixes himself up. Patrick comes back with a tank.]
Patrick: [comes out from the hatch] Hey!
SpongeBob: Hey, where'd you get the tank, Patrick?
Patrick: It's what this company makes. Tanks.
[SpongeBob looks and sees tank-themed advertisements, tank posters, a tank sculpture, a first place trophy in in tanks, and even a tank mobile, behind his back.]
SpongeBob: How did I not notice that? [grabs the cleaning products] We'll use these as ammunition! [stuffs the tank with the cleaning products]
[The trash robot and his machine army search for SpongeBob and Patrick. They stop and see SpongeBob riding a tank.]
Trash robot: Retreat! Retreat!
[SpongeBob and Patrick fire the tank. They shoot a plunger on the copier. The copier crashes into the wall. The wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. The fourth, third and second floor of the building crash down onto one another. The paper shredder tries to escape, but SpongeBob and Patrick fire the tank at it with the plunger. The paper shredder crashes into another wall. The wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. The upper floors then crash down onto the first floor. The trash robot emerges from the rubble and is completely wrecked up. It bumps into the tank and becomes afraid, thinking that SpongeBob and Patrick are going to hurt it.]
Patrick: [comes out from the hatch] Hello!
[The trash robot surrenders the war and waves a little white flag. The trash robot goes to leave.]
SpongeBob: Hey, trash bot! [throws a chunk of the building to the trash robot and it eats it]
Trash robot: Yummy, trash.
[The last wall breaks apart and falls outside the building. Now, the entire building is completely destroyed. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick finally cleaning the stain off the floor of the main office right before dawn.]
SpongeBob: SpongeBob SquarePants always keeps his word. That carpet is clean.
Patrick: And I helped!
SpongeBob: You sure did, buddy! Come on, pal. Let's go get us a snack.
Patrick: Oh, I like that sound, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob and Patrick leave the building as it now stands in ruin. Meanwhile, the worker, who was not aware of the destruction, gets up from his chair, stretches and prepares to leave. However, he falls downward. The security guard enters the ruins of the building and catches the worker. He sees the place completely destroyed and drops the worker.]
Security Guard: I quit.

 
[Montage of aspects of the Krusty Krab are shown, starting the episode]
Narrator: Welcome aboard. If you're watching this video, then let me be the first to say: Congratulations. [a rainbow with the word "Congratulations" appears] You've recently been hired in the Krusty Krab [a spatula, a hat, and a bucket appear in SpongeBob's hands] and this is your first official day of training.
SpongeBob: Can I make a Krabby Patty now?
Narrator: Oh no, you've got a lot to learn before you're ready to make a Krabby Patty. As you can see by this graph... [Scene cuts to a giraffe] *ahem* graph. [A graph is shown. The Krusty Krab is moving up.] You have been employed in one of the most successful restaurants in Bikini Bottom. But it didn't get that way over night... [it is night time] because the store closes at 6. [scene cuts to picture of Mr. Krabs and the Krusty Krab behind him] No, the story of the Krusty Krab is the story of one man's hard work, perseverance, vision, determination and sweat. [scene zooms into one of Mr. Krabs' armpits] But mostly his sweat. [scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding to the right and stops on the screen, followed by sparkles] From Humble Beginnings. [scene cuts to a sepia picture of Mr. Krabs as a child, walking up to a soda machine with a quarter on a string wrapped around his hand] You may think that Mr. Eugene H. Krabs, owner and founder of Krusty Krab Inc., has always been the financial wizard he is today. [Mr. Krabs puts in his quarter then takes it out; it's attached to a piece of rope with a hole in the quarter] And you're right! [Mr. Krabs laughs while drinking his soda. Scene cuts to a tired Mr. Krabs, sitting depressed in a room with light at the window] After the war, Krabs stayed secluded in a deep depression that seemed endless. [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, now a retirement home with elderly fish outside playing shuffleboard] But then his luck changed when he acquired a bankrupt retirement home and with a few minor alterations, the Krusty Krab was born! [Mr. Krabs paints a giant "K" with a bucket full of red paint, on a sign outside. We can hear a sound of a baby crying in the background]
Baby: *waahh waahh*
Narrator: [Scene cuts to a Krabby Patty with a light shining on it] Sounds like a lot of...
Hoopla fish: Hoopla!
Narrator: Sounds like a lot of...
Hoopla fish: Hoopla!
Narrator: Sounds like a...
Hoopla fish: Hoopla! [Scrolls over to a small fish yelling] HOOPLA! [someone off screen throws a brick on the fish, knocking him unconscious. Screen scrolls back to the patty]
Narrator: Sounds like a lot of hoopla to make over a little Krabby Patty, right? Haha, wrong! [scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding to the right again] The Krusty Krab today. [scene cuts to a series of close-ups in the Krusty Krab. Then scene cuts to a view of the inside of the Krusty Krab where customers are eating Krabby Patties] To keep up with today's demanding customers, no expense has been spared to acquire all the latest achievements in fast-food technology.
Mr. Krabs: [holds up a spatula in his left hand] This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism. [now standing at the register] Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch! [now holding some ice cubes] These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported. [holds up a straw] This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine. [puts the straw in the cup and drinks it] And most importantly, [holds up some ketchup packets] You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee.
Narrator: [SpongeBob is standing there when a packet of ketchup, spatula, a cash register, cup, and ice cubes appear around him] All of this modernization seems a little overwhelming, doesn't it? [the items spin around him] Well luckily for you, Mr. Krabs fear of robot overlords keeps the balance of technology in check. [items disappear and SpongeBob floats to the right. The scene changes to SpongeBob standing next to Squidward near the cash register] But if modernization is the heart of the Krusty Krab, then employees are the liver and gallbladder. [close-up of SpongeBob] Let's see if you got what it takes. Hmmm, poised, confident, and a smile that says, "Hello world! May I take your order?" You've got the makings of a good employee, Mr. SquarePants. But for every good employee, there is one who is not so good. [close-up of Squidward reading his dance magazine] Let's see, inattentive, impatient, a glazed look in the eyes. [close-up of the button Squidward is wearing on his shirt] Look carefully at the "I Really Wish I Weren't Here Right Now!" button. There's a name for employees like this, but we'll call him Squidward.
Squidward: I'm getting paid overtime for this, right Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [in his office] Sorry, can't hear you! [scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding to the right]
Narrator: Training.
SpongeBob: Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?
Narrator: No, you can't make a Krabby Patty without understanding the phrase POOP.
SpongeBob: POOP?
Narrator: Once you understand POOP, you'll understand your place at the Krusty Krab. But what does POOP mean? [SpongeBob shrugs his arms] It's actually a carefully organized code. Watch closely. People Order Our Patties.
SpongeBob: Oh, POOP! [smiles proudly]
Narrator: Looks like Mr. SquarePants understands POOP. [scene cuts to a customer walking up to Squidward] Here's a typical customer. I wonder what he wants. Well, if we just remember POOP, we can figure it out.
Harold: I'd like to order- [screen freezes to a quiz]
Narrator: Do you think he's going to order: A: A sofa, B: An expensive haircut, or C: A patty?
Harold: One patty please.
Narrator: Ah, POOP! You never let us down! [scene cuts to a giant Krabby Patty] Now that you understand POOP, I bet you think you're ready to make a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Krabby Patty! [panting towards the Krabby Patty but once he gets too close, he gets splattered on the screen with a fly swatter]
Narrator: Ha-ha! Not so fast, Eager McBeaver. We haven't even talked about: [scene cuts to a toilet] Personal Hygiene. [toilet flushes. Scene cuts to SpongeBob in front of a sink] Every employee at the Krusty Krab must comply with a strict set of personal hygiene guidelines. [SpongeBob turns the faucet on] Okay, Mr. SquarePants, are you ready to prepare for your shift? [SpongeBob lathers his hands] A good employee always washes himself thoroughly. Be sure to get under those fingernails. [SpongeBob nods and rubs a bit harder] And don't forget about the knuckles. [SpongeBob rubs a bit harder] And make sure those palms are squeaky clean. [SpongeBob rubs the hardest he can] All right, let's see those hands! [holds up his arms but it is invisible from rubbing so much] Now that's thorough, HAHA. [chuckles. Scene cuts to SpongeBob's shiny boots] After making sure your boots are polished, your face is clear of any blemishes or boils, [SpongeBob cuts his boil off with scissors] and your hair is neat and tidy, [SpongeBob lifts up his hat, sprays a little hairspray on a single hair to make it straight, then puts his hat back on] you are ready to start the day! Now let's see how Squidward prepares for his shift. [one of the bathroom stall doors opens to show Squidward sitting on the toilet with his dance magazine on his lap. He then notices that people are looking at him. He laughs nervously and shuts the stall door shut] REMEMBER, NO EMPLOYEE WANTS TO BE A SQUIDWARD. [a giant Krabby Patty appears on the screen again] Now that you're clean and hygienic, I bet you think you're ready to make that Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [yells in excitement] I'm ready! [splits into two SpongeBobs] I'm ready!! [splits into more SpongeBobs] I'm ready!! [splits himself into more SpongeBobs] I'm ready!!! [fly swatters splat all of them on the screen]
Narrator: Whoa there! We have a few more topics to cover first. [scene cuts to food and a spatula lying on a table] Your Work Station. [scene cuts to SpongeBob vacuuming on top of the stove] It's important to keep your area tidy and free of droppings. But a clean workstation is only part of the job. [scene cuts to SpongeBob thinking of a Krabby Patty in a thought bubble of his] To make the vision in your head a reality, you'll need supplies. And a good employee always keeps his supplies well-organized. [SpongeBob opens up a cabinet, then opens the bottom drawer to reveal a bunch of folders with names of condiments and ingredients on there] Very nice, Mr. SquarePants, not a pickle out of place. [SpongeBob peeks out the kitchen door] Now let's see how Squidward keeps his work station. [Squidward's work station is covered in ketchup and mustard. The octopus is sprawled out sleeping with a dance magazine on his face and a "Do not disturb" sign hanging on his left feet. He wakes up]
Squidward: Huh? [shouts] Oh! [falls on the floor. The cash register drawer opens up and conks Squidward in the head]
Narrator: Don't worry, Squidward, Mr. SquarePants can cover for you. [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing next to the grill] Now that your workstation is up and running, perhaps you think you're ready to make the world-famous Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob barks like a dog then runs around the room. Narrator laughs] Calm down. [a bone is thrown at him then he grabs it with his teeth and gnaws it] There's plenty of time left. We have to make sure you're ready for the psychological aspect of the job: [A execution chair is seen] Interfacing with your Boss. [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Mr. Krabs in his office]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?
Mr. Krabs: No.
Narrator: Good job, Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: [runs up to the camera] Can I make a Krabby Patty now- [scene cuts to Patrick walking into the Krusty Krab]
Narrator: Now we go from behind the scenes to the front lines, where we'll examine the most important aspect of the industry, the customer. Or as we like to say, the "Krustomer"!
Patrick: [stops] Who said that? Are you a ghost?
Narrator: Like precious, precious blood in an animal, customers are what makes the Krusty Krab strong and alive.
Patrick: Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me.
Squidward: Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?
Patrick: Uhh... I'll have an uhh... uhh... uhh... ah... [falls asleep and snores until Squidward snaps at him causing him to wake up] Huh? What's that?
Squidward: Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else.
Narrator: Ah-ah-ah, Squidward, remember what Mr. Krabs says.
Mr. Krabs: [A cut-out of Mr. Krabs and the sentence "The money is always right!" are seen] The money is always right!
Patrick: The ceiling is right, Squidward. You're not a very good employee.
Squidward: Fine! May I please take your order?
Patrick: I'll have uhh... uhhhh... [drones again as Squidward gets mad and grabs the cash register]
Narrator: We'll check up on these two later. [scene cuts to a siren] Right now, it's important that we discuss an Emergency Situation! [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing by a Krabby Patty looking around for something] Like the lost gold of Atlantis, many consider the Krabby Patty to be a treasure. And as with every treasure, there's a thief ready to steal it. So it's up to you to be the watchful eyes of... [the Krabby Patty moves as metal legs come out of it and it walks off] What's this? [Plankton is on the patty] It's Mr. Krabs business rival, Plankton!
Plankton: Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs! Your secret formula is finally mine! [scene cuts to SpongeBob with a face of shock]
Narrator: He's stealing the formula! What are you going to do, Mr. SquarePants?! [SpongeBob screams and runs around the restaurant. Mr. Krabs walks up to Plankton as he and the patty are going really slow]
Plankton: You'll never catch me, Krabs! Not after I switch into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE! [whips the Krabby Patty into going faster, but only slightly] Hi-ya! [mechanical legs whirring, Mr. Krabs grabs the patty] I knew I should've gotten the turbo. [SpongeBob is still screaming and knocking over tables and chairs] Hear me, Krabs! You'll take this Krabby Patty from me when you pry it from my cold, dead... [Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton, who is now talking in a high-pitched voice in fast motion] Felicitations, malefactors! I am encountering my minions. And I know just how to speak their language- [Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton back to the Chum Bucket, him seeing SpongeBob is still screaming.]
Narrator: And so, another emergency is avoided, thanks to Mr. SquarePants. [scene cuts to Squidward and Patrick, Patrick is still saying: "Uhhhhhh..." Squidward looks annoyed] Let's check in on Squidward again. Psst, Squidward.
Squidward: Huh?
Narrator: Just remember: POOP.
Squidward: Patrick, if I could make a suggestion. Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?
Patrick: Great idea, Squidward! One Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: [sighs] Will that be for here or to go? [closes his mouth]
Patrick: Uhhh... [Squidward bangs his head on the register]
Narrator: Hang in there, Squidward, it's all part of the job. [scene cuts to a shot of the Krusty Krab training manual] Now that you've learned the basics of your training, it's time for the moment you've been waiting for. [a blue screen appears with the Krabby Patty slowly coming closer to the screen.] Da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, Da-da-da-da-da-da-daa Da-da-da-la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, tssshh Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa-da-da-da-da-daa, Ti-ta-ti-ti-ta-ti-ti-ta-ta-ta-la-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba-baa, Ti-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-taa, Ti-ta-ti-li [gasps, then resumes] Ti-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-ta-ti-ti-ta-ti-ti-taaaaa. Preparing the Krabby Patty! At the center of every great dynasty is the crown jewel, which keeps it alive and thriving! For the Krusty Krab, this is the Krabby Patty. [SpongeBob licks the poster.] And now you, the humble employee of the industry, the all too necessary human resource that keeps this business afloat will earn the sacred and dark secrets of how to prepare with your very own hands... [SpongeBob gasps in joy.] the sumptuous, the lip moistening, spine tingling, heart stopping pleasure center that is the Krabby Patty! Are you ready? [SpongeBob nods excitedly.] Are you sure? [SpongeBob nods harder but half of his face tears apart.] Okay! The secret formula is- [Cut to credits]


[At a roofed wrestling stadium. Stage lights move around outside.]
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here and coming to you live from the Bikini Bottom Wrestling Royal Rumble Free for All. [Mr. Krabs comes up]
Mr. Krabs: Free?! Gimme, gimme, gimme! [He runs around, holding out and pinching his claws] Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! [He becomes aware that there is no money in the building] Gimme. Gimme. Gimme? [He goes back to Perch] Uhh... what do I get?
Perch Perkins: Well, what you get is the most anticipated event of the wrestling season! [shows tough guys lined up] Hundreds of wrestlers from around the world face off against the heavyweight champs. [shows the heavyweight champs]
Wrestlers #1 and #2: [both roar]
[One punches the other one in the stomach repeatedly and other one rips the other champ in half using his knee and crowd is shocked]
Wrestler #2: [roars and throws the 2 pieces of Wrestler #1 onto the ring floor]
[Wrestler #1 gets up, looking unharmed]
Wrestlers #1 and #2: [both roar again]
Perch Perkins: Anyone who can defeat these giants will earn the championship title.
Mr. Krabs: [yawns] Big deal.
Perch Perkins: And the million dollar cash prize.
[The wrestlers are next to a green bag with a dollar sign on it. Wrestler #2 has his foot on it]
Mr. Krabs: [Eyes turn into dollar symbols] Million... dollars... cash prize?! [rips off his shirt and screams, then goes to back of line] Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
[The fight bell rings and a man detaches the red rope holding the line of contestants back only to get stomped on as they run towards the arena]
Mr. Krabs: Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money! Money, money... [hears contestants getting beaten up by the wrestlers] [nervously] Money... money... money. [stops as the rest of the line advances] Money?
[A medical crew comes and takes out the people in a ball]
Mr. Krabs: Ohhhhhh. [he quivers, looks upon the stage]
[A pile of contestants is on the ring floor]
Contestant: My leg! My leg.
[A janitor sweeps the pile from the ring]
Mr. Krabs: No living soul should have to suffer through what I've witnessed here today. Except maybe...
[Later, SpongeBob and Patrick run to the stage blindfolded and excited and they both laugh. Mr. Krabs guides them with a leash]
SpongeBob: Where are you taking us, Mr. Krabs? [they continue to laugh]
[Mr. Krabs releases the leash]
Mr. Krabs: Now go get them!
SpongeBob: [He and Patrick laughs] What do you think the surprise is, Patrick?
Patrick: I don't know. What do you think it is?
SpongeBob: I don't know. What do you... [they both run into the wrestlers] Ohhh. Whatever it is, it's really big.
Patrick: [pops out from one of the wrestlers' chest hair] And hairy.
[Wrestler #2 picks up and breathes on SpongeBob who coughs every time he gets blown on]
SpongeBob: And it smells angry.
Patrick: Is it time to look yet?
SpongeBob: You peek first.
Patrick: No, you peek first.
[Wrestler #2 squeezes SpongeBob until his eyeballs pop out and see the wrestlers and Wrestler #1 does same to Patrick.Both of them scream and get out of the wrestlers' hands and run behind Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Hey, who are those guys, Mr. Krabs? They look like they wanna hurt us.
Mr. Krabs: What? Those two? Ah, they're harmless. It's all just part of the act.
SpongeBob: The act?
Mr. Krabs: Of course. They're just pretending.
Patrick: Pretending?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We like pretending.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Don't we all?
Patrick: Can we wear costumes?
Mr. Krabs: Eh... sure.
Patrick: [turns to show his butt] Hey, SpongeBob, how do I look?
SpongeBob: Wow. Looks like those Iron Bun workout videos are really paying off.
[Cuts to Patrick at home doing his bun workouts]
Woman on Exercising Video: And 2, and 3, and 4 steps closer to your dream body.
[Cut to Patrick sleeping and still doing the exercise]
Patrick: I can even do it in my sleep.
[Scene cuts back to the wrestling arena]
SpongeBob: Wow! Can we have cool nicknames too?
Mr. Krabs: Ohh, fine. [pointing at SpongeBob] You're the, uh, Short Order Boy, [pointing at Patrick] and he's the... um, well, uh, Pink Patty. [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: And together we are...
Mr. Krabs: The Krusty Krushers. Now go out there and wrestle me up a million dollars!
[They both fly into the ropes because of the force of Mr. Krabs' yell and bounce off and laugh]
SpongeBob: This is going to be so fun. Yeah!
Patrick: Whoo!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Patrick: Whoo!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Patrick: Whoo!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Patrick: Whoo!
SpongeBob: Okay, we're ready.
Announcer: [looks at watch] Huh? Oh, yeah. Al, send the mike down. We got fresh meat.
SpongeBob: Actually, we're here to fake wrestle.
Patrick: And to pretend wrestle.
Announcer: Whatever. [clears his voice] In this corner we have the challengers, the Krusty Krushers!
[They both pull out a Krabby Patty and they chew it like they're tough. SpongeBob burps after he bites his. The crowd is cheering]
SpongeBob: [burps] Oh, excuse me.
Mr. Krabs: You can do it!
Announcer: And on the opposite side of the ring, we have the undefeated champions.
[Wrestler #1 lifts up a barbell then Wrestler #2 crushes the barbell with his bare hands and puts it in a Krabby Patty and eats it then burps in Wrestler #1's face until his skin rips off as the crowd boos]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts... [As the 2 wrestlers' shadows go over them, the announcer runs away]
SpongeBob: Did it just get dark in here?
Patrick: Dark?! I'm afraid of the dark.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't be afraid. It's just them.
Patrick: Oh, right, it's just those guys we're gonna wrestle. [Waves at them] Hello, fellow competitors. [Wrestler #1 screams so loud that they fall to the ground]
Patrick: What was that?
SpongeBob: [reading Wrestling for Beginners Book] That's Wrestlese for "You're dead meat."
Patrick: I don't get it. [Wrestler #1 picks up both of them and throws them]
SpongeBob: Hey, look, Patrick, it's Mr. Krabs cheering us on.
[They crash into Wrestler #2 then SpongeBob falls into a bucket]
SpongeBob: Whoa.
[Patrick also lands into the bucket on top of SpongeBob]
Patrick: Oh, hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Look, Patrick, [points to wrestler] it's a fist.
Patrick: A fist? Where? [turns around] Oh, yeah, that's definitely a...
[They both get punched more and more until they turn to liquid. Wrestler #1 gargles SpongeBob and Patrick and spits them out into the drain. The crowd groans as they slosh down the drain. An impatient Mr. Krabs uses a plunger to get them out.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: How fun was that?
Patrick: It was so super duper fun. [They do a Pattycake like handshake]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Boom!
[Mr Krabs clears his throat]
SpongeBob: Did you need something, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, did I need something? Hmm, let me think. Did I need something? [suddenly angry voice] Yes, I need something! I need you 2 to get back in there and show them who's boss! Show them what Short Order Boy and Pink Patty can really do!
SpongeBob: Right! C'mon, Patrick, let's show these two who they're messing with.
Patrick: With pleasure.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Let's do this!
[They both walk away with angry expressions]
Mr. Krabs: That's the million dollar winning spirit.
SpongeBob: Alright, you two, no more messing around. You see this? [pulls out his spatula] It's just a spatula, right? Wrong! Actually, this represents your face after I get through mangling it. [tries to bend spatula but can only bend it a little bit] There, you see that? It's not gonna be pretty when I get done with ya.
Patrick: Hey, good one, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick. Now you try saying something intimidating as well.
Patrick: Okay. [Takes SpongeBob's spatula] And if you think this is bad, wait till I get my hands on ya. [takes out a piece of paper] I'm gonna, uh... I'm gonna... tear ya to shreds! Like a... [struggles with ripping the paper] C'mon! Ah! I got a paper cut! Paper cut! [starts sucking his hands]
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you okay?
Patrick: Huh? Oh, I'm fine. I just like to suck on my hand.
SpongeBob: Really? Me, too. [They both suck on their hands. Wrestler #1 picks up Patrick and squishes him into a ball. Mr. Krabs screams thinking he's gonna get hurt but Wrestler #1 takes the rope]
Mr. Krabs: Oh. Heh heh. Now what?
[Wrestler #1 ties the rope to Patrick. He then picks up SpongeBob and puts the rope connected to Patrick behind his back. Then he pretends it's a paddleball.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] That tickles. [Wrestler #2 takes Patrick as a ball]
Patrick: Good catch! [Wrestler #2 twists him and Wrestler #1 does same to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Look, I'm a...
Patrick: Helicopter.
[They collide and are shredded into pieces. They fall into a wagon and Wrestler #1 throws the wagon in a cement truck. Both scream as the truck starts blending them and the crowd cheers. Mr. Krabs bites on the rope nervously. Inside the truck, Wrestler #2 pulls the pour lever and SpongeBob and Patrick come out as cement and go into the wagon. Whistling, Wrestler #1 pours them into deep spaces and they dry out. Wrestler #1 puts his hand in SpongeBob and writes "Jim was here" with his finger. SpongeBob giggles. Wrestler #2 puts his foot in Patrick and writes "My foot was here" with his toe. Patrick giggles. The wrestlers both laugh and butt heads. Mr. Krabs pulls them out with 2 spatulas.]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing out there?!
SpongeBob: Fake wrestling.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, but you still have to try to win in fake wrestling.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're having so much fun! Doesn't that make us winners?
Mr. Krabs: Actually... [literally steaming mad] It doesn't! [SpongeBob and Patrick just stand there] Okay, okay, look. Just... [notices they're gone] Hey, where'd they... [gasps] Oh, no! Not the...
[The crowd gasps]
Perch Perkins: Wow, now that's a serious Sleeper Hold. [SpongeBob is in the arms of Wrestler #1 about to go to sleep. Wrestler #1 gives SpongeBob a jellyfish plush]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Mr. Fluffy.
[Patrick and Wrestler #2 is doing the same thing. Patrick does baby talk before being handed a bottle.]
Crowd: Aw.
[The wrestlers then put them in a bed and cover them with a blanket]
Perch Perkins: And it looks like the champs are ready to end it.
Mr. Krabs: End it?!
Crowd: [chanting] End it!
Mr. Krabs: Get up! Get up, you guys!!!
[The wrestlers dig a hole in the sand floor. Wrestler #1 grabs one of the ropes and the wrestlers use it as a slingshot to launch themselves high into the air and through the ceiling of the arena. They wrap their arms together and spin as they fall and crash back into the arena. As they do this, Perch speaks]
Perch Perkins: Yep. They're gonna leave more than a mark with this special move. The mother of all moves, the Flying Double Decker Atomic Headbutt of Destruction... [The wrestlers literally start spinning like a drill] with a spin.
Mr. Krabs: [screams] C'mon, c'mon! WAKE UP!!! [Patrick is dreaming of doing his Iron Bun exercise]
Patrick: [in his sleep] 1 and 2 and squeeze...!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, who am I kidding? Goodbye, money. [goes to ringside]
Patrick: Squeeze...!!
Mr. Krabs: Goodbye, money. [sobs]
Patrick: SQUEEZE...!!!
[Patrick's Iron Buns rip through his costume]
Wrestlers #1 &amp; #2: [gasp] Oh no!
Wrestler #2: The Iron Butt!
[They land on Patrick's Iron Buns and crack, then shatter into pieces that are then swept up by the janitor, who is whistling]
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, here are your new champions!
Mr. Krabs: Goodbye, mon- ... new champions?!
Perch Perkins: That's right, Skip. And the winner of one million dollars.
Mr. Krabs: [his eyes, teeth and tongue transforms into money] Hello, money!!!! [starts hugging the money] Woo-hoo! Money, sweet money!
Perch Perkins: Or...
Mr. Krabs: Or?!
Perch Perkins: You can take what's behind Curtain #2.
Mr. Krabs: Curtain Number 2?
Perch: Make all your dreams come true with 1 week at Wrestle Camp.
Mr. Krabs: Like we're really gonna turn all this money for...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wrestle Camp! Wrestle Camp, Wrestle Camp, Wrestle Camp!
Perch Perkins: Wrestle Camp it is.
[The janitor vacuums up all the money and Mr. Krabs falls apart, then the janitor walks away]
SpongeBob: See you at Wrestle Camp, Mr. Krabs!
[He drops a Wrestle Camp hat on Mr. Krabs and episode ends.]


[The exterior of the Krusty Krab is shown.]
Mr. Krabs: [Off-Screen] Da da dee. [Mr. Krabs is shown in his office. He is stitching.] Stitch one purl two. da da dee doo. [The scene shows that he is stitching a pattern of a dollar bill.] Da day dee da. Dee doh.. [He abruptly stops and sniffs the air.] What's that smell? [He runs over to the cashier boat.] The register! [He shakes the register and smells it.] $49.0... 8?! That's a penny short! [He starts crying.]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, no. Not a penny. Help! Somebody, help us.
[SpongeBob slides up from the floor of the boat.]
SpongeBob: It's just a penny, sir. [Mr. Krabs stops crying. SpongeBob jumps out of the boat.] It doesn't matter.
Mr. Krabs: Doesn't matter? It's money that makes the world go round, boy! It's money that keeps your [He holds up a right-angled ruler to SpongeBob's pants.] pants square! It's money that keeps Squidward in frilly soap!
[The scene cuts to Squidward in the Dining area sniffing the air.]
Squidward: Lilac!
[The scene cuts to show the Krusty Krab with numerous large bandages on it.]
Mr. Krabs: It's money that paid for all them renovations we did! Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that... [Something catches his eye] Hmm? ...scrumptious, curvy cutie.
SpongeBob: I see her, Mr. Krabs. [The scene cuts to a Krabby Patty on a tray, next to a soda.] A Krabby Patty with cheese. [A pair of flippers grabs the sandwich. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs.] The classic.
Mr. Krabs: Not the sandwich, boy. The curvy cutie holding the sandwich.
[The scene cuts to Mrs. Puff eating the Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] Hey! [On-Screen] that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!
Mr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff? Aw, she's married.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single.
Mr. Krabs: Then what happened to Mr. Puff?
[The scene cuts to Mr. Puff, who is now a lamp, being turned on. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: She doesn't like to talk about it.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a lass like that on me claw.
SpongeBob: Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, I, I'm, I'm too old, boy. Too hard-shelled for love. Besides, I ain't not properly dressed.
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Mr. Krabs! [The scene cuts to a close-up of his clothes, which are messy.] You look great. [The scene cuts back to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.] You wait here while I go break the ice.
[SpongeBob quickly runs off.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooh!
[It cuts to a wide shot of Mrs. Puff.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
[Mrs. Puff screams.]
Mrs. Puff: Hit the brakes, SpongeBob! Watch that tree! Left! Left!
SpongeBob: [He snaps his fingers.] Wait, Mrs. Puff! We're not driving.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't expect to see you here.
SpongeBob: I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss?
Mrs. Puff: Well, I'm not...
SpongeBob: Don't move!
[SpongeBob runs back to Mr. Krabs.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
SpongeBob: [While dragging Mr. Krabs to the table] Mrs. Puff, [The two stop.] I'd like to introduce you to Mr... [Mr. Krabs falls forward onto the floor. SpongeBob props him back up.] Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs.
Mrs. Puff: [Nervously] Uh, hello.
[Mr. Krabs quivers.]
SpongeBob: Psst! Mr. Krabs, say hello. [Mr. Krabs nervously mutters.] No, no, Mr. Krabs. Just say hello.
[Mr. Krabs performs a strangled groan.]
Mrs. Puff: Hmm, perhaps another time would be...
Mr. Krabs: [As Mrs. Puff is starting to leave, Mr. Krabs yelling at SpongeBob] No!
SpongeBob: Wait. [As Mrs. Puff sits back down and shivering] He's trying to tell you something.
Mrs. Puff: [Shivering] Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs jerks his eyes and moving his arms around weirdly, while speaking gibberish.] I don't understand.
[Mr. Krabs looks at SpongeBob and speaks gibberish to him.]
SpongeBob: [While Mr. Krabs is speaking gibberish] Oh! I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to... [Mr. Krabs stops speaking gibberish and turns around.] ...hit you with a rake!
Mrs. Puff: [Scared] Goodness!
Mr. Krabs: No!
[Mr. Krabs lifts his tall eyes up and down, while Speaking gibberish.]
SpongeBob: Try to guess your weight.
Mrs. Puff: [Offended] Well!
[Mr. Krabs flails his arms, while speaking gibberish.]
SpongeBob: [While Mr. Krabs is speaking gibberish] No, wait. He wants to take you... [thinks for a second] ...on a date!
[Mr. Krabs gasps happily and falls over]
Mrs. Puff: Is that true, Mr. Krabs? Do you want to take me on a date?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. What do you say?
Mrs. Puff: What do I say? [starts laughing] I say, you have a way with words, Mr. Krabs.
[Mrs. Puff walks away.]
Mr. Krabs: I still got it. [chuckles]
[The bubble transition goes to the exterior of the Krabs' house at night.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] Ready for your date, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [Off-screen] I'm always ready when it comes to datin', lad!
[The interior of the Krabs' Anchor is shown.]
SpongeBob: [While he is holding a list, and Mr. Krabs, who is wearing fancy clothes, walk down stairs] Breath spray?
Mr. Krabs: [sprays mouth with breath spray] Check.
SpongeBob: Lucky hanky?
Mr. Krabs: [He takes out his hanky.] Check.
SpongeBob: Giant rusty anchor?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, anchor. Anchor? I can't find me giant rusty anchor!
[SpongeBob throws the list away and laughs]
SpongeBob: Relax, Mr. Krabs. [While opening the door.] Just a little joke. [While making a circle in the air with his hands.] Good luck with you know who.
[SpongeBob moves his eyebrows up and down.]
Mr. Krabs: Who's that?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah. Well, wish me luck, lad!
[The bubble transition goes to the exterior of Fancy!]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen] Oh, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff are shown at a table inside.] This dinner has been so wonderful. The coral was cooked to perfection. [giggles] I don't think I could eat another bite.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I doubt that, my little shrimp boat.
[Mrs. Puff giggles.]
Mrs. Puff: You're spoiling me, Mr. Krabs. I mean, [The scene shows a squid rubbing Mrs. Puff's feet.] foot rubs between courses. [While pulling out a caricature of herself.] Caricatures. Imported music. [The scene swift pans to a live-action scuba diver plays the piano on the other side of the room. The scene shows Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing's too good for you, my prickly peach.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, what I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Krabs, is...
Waiter: Uh, sir, your fancy pantsy limousine is here.
Mr. Krabs: Wonderful! Pufflily-poo, your chariot awaits!
Mrs. Puff: Well...
[Mr. Krabs whistles and two men join the waiter in carrying a screaming Mrs. Puff away.]
Mr. Krabs: You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib.
[He sighs as the waiter approaches him again.]
Waiter: Your bill, sir.
[Mr. Krabs takes the bill.]
Mr. Krabs:  What? [it shows the bill] $100?! Well, this can't possibly be correct!
Waiter: Oh, my mistake, sir. Thank you for pointing that out. [he hands Mr. Krabs a different bill] This is your bill.
[Mr. Krabs takes the bill. Looks down and his eyes enlarge, oddly. The exterior of the restaurant is shown and the cork flies off. The scream shatters the glass bottle, which causes the sign to go flying and the valet fall over. The bubble transitions shows the Krabs' anchor at night. It then cuts to the interior and Mr. Krabs, who is back in his normal clothes, crying on the floor. SpongeBob is also there.]
SpongeBob: I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night?
[Mr. Krabs gets up.]
Mr. Krabs: [Still crying] Oh, SpongeBob! I couldn't help but spend every cent I had on her! I couldn't control myself!
SpongeBob: What are you gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know, boy! I've got another date tomorrow! I'm caught in the middle of me two great loves! Sweet Mrs. Puff, and the rest of me money!
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs is crying] I wish there was some way I could help.
[Mr. Krabs stops crying.]
Mr. Krabs: Perhaps there is, boy! [hands SpongeBob his wallet] I'm puttin' you in charge of me money.
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You come with me on the date and don't let me spend any money. [The bubble transition shows Mrs. Puff's house. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk up to it.] Now remember, we keep it cheap by going to the park. And no matter how much I ask you, you don't give me any of me money. Now give me a dollar.
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Good boy! You'll do fine.
[Mr. Krabs knocks on the door.]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen; singingly] Who is it?
Mr. Krabs: It's me, [Mr. Krabs' pupils turn into hearts.] my beautiful bell buoy!
[Mrs. Puff is heard giggling.]
Mrs. Puff: Just a minute!
[Mr. Krabs pupils turn back to normal.]
Mr. Krabs: Flowers! Flowers, boy! Go get flowers!
SpongeBob: But you said...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't call on a classy lady like Mrs. Puff empty-handed. We ain't talking about this... [He makes a square in the air.] ...or this... [He makes a triangle in the air.] ...we're talking about this!
[Mr. Krabs makes the circle in the air.]
Mrs. Puff: [Off-screen] Almost ready.
Mr. Krabs: Hurry, boy! Get the flowers!
[SpongeBob runs off as Mrs. Puff opens her door.]
Mr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff. You're as beautiful as ever.
[Mrs. Puff sighs.]
Mrs. Puff: That's funny. I thought I heard SpongeBob's voice.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, e-excuse me. I have to call my insurance agent.
[Mrs. Puff hurries back inside]
Mr. Krabs: Of course, my beautiful Puff.
[Mr. Krabs sighs and his pupils turn to hearts again.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen; making the heart pupils go away] Mr. Krabs, [While walking to give Mr. Krabs the flowers.] I got the flowers you wanted me to buy.
Mr. Krabs: [While turning around.] What's that?
SpongeBob: I got the flowers for Mrs. Puff.
Mr. Krabs: We had an agreement, boy. You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!
SpongeBob: But you said...
Mrs. Puff: [As Mr. Krabs' pupils turn to hearts again] Here I come!
Mr. Krabs: [while Mrs. Puff opens the door and he grabs the flowers] For you, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, [as she is grabbing the flowers] flowers. Oh, how thoughtful!
Mr. Krabs: [While he holds out an empty claw] And here's a box of chocolates. [He turns back to SpongeBob.] SpongeBob, where's the chocolates?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't go to Mrs. Puff's house without chocolates. Hurry! Hurry!
[SpongeBob runs off. SpongeBob comes back with the heart-shaped box of chocolates]
SpongeBob: [As Mr. Krabs' pupil return to normal] I bought the biggest box they had!
Mr. Krabs: Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!
Mrs. Puff: [As Mr. Krabs' pupils turn back into hearts] Oh, Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: [As he offer Mrs. Puff the box of chocolates] Here's those chocolates I bought for you. What are we doing today, Mrs. Puff? Dinner? Dancing? A trip to the moon?
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs' eyes turn back to normal] Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?
Mrs. Puff: Actually, a walk in the park sounds perfect. It's a beautiful day. I'll just need to get a sun hat and...
Mr. Krabs: [While his pupils turn back into hearts] Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, I think she...
Mr. Krabs: The sun is beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head.
SpongeBob: As your financial advisor, I suggest...
Mr. Krabs: [his eyes are back to normal] There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!
[SpongeBob starts to leave, but comes back.]
SpongeBob: But...
Mr. Krabs: Today! [SpongeBob runs off and Mrs. Puff puts her fins over her mouth.] Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll [He takes out a barrel.] shade ya! [He places the barrel on Mrs. Puff's head.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, hurry!
SpongeBob: [as he comes back from the store with a large straw hat] One shady hat.
Mr. Krabs: Good job, lad. 
[Mr. Krabs puts the hat on Mrs. Puff.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, well, thank you, but you didn't need to buy one. I have a hat in the closet.
Mr. Krabs: Didn't need to buy one? [He turns his head around like an owl to face SpongeBob, still grinning] You hear that, boy? [in high pitch] We didn't need to buy a hat. [angrily] Aren't you supposed to be saving me money?!
SpongeBob: I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!
Narrator: A few moments later...
Mr. Krabs: [happily as hearts float in the background] SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat! [After SpongeBob buys one, Krabs is mad and flaming dollars float in the background]
Mr. Krabs: You're spending all me money! [happily] Puffy needs a new pair of shoes! [SpongeBob gets the shoes]
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] You're breaking me, boy! [happily] She needs fine jewelry! [SpongeBob gets the jewelry] Not that fine! [SpongeBob runs back and forth, speeding up, carrying various items as Mr. Krabs keeps yelling his name. He eventually becomes too tired to move] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a pink umbrella] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a bicycle] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a purple surfboard] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a grandfather clock] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with an anchor barbell] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back with a TV] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes back and forth with lots of presents] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
[his voice echoes, and SpongeBob is seen sitting on the ground, his arms stretched, and he is panting]
Mr. Krabs: [runs up, his eyes are shaped like hearts] SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff...
SpongeBob: Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say, [stretches out his eyeballs, imitating Mr. Krabs] "Arrgh, SpongeBob! Yer spending all me money!" And then I'll say, "But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!" Then you'll say, "We're not talking about this..." [Makes the triangle] ..."Or this"... [Makes the square] ..."we're talking about this!" [He squiggles all over the screen. The screen fades out for a moment. Fades back in to see SpongeBob panting with Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: But, lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this! [Cut to Mrs. Puff who has many unneeded, expensive items surrounding her]
Mrs. Puff: Are we going to the park soon?
Mr. Krabs: Please, lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her! [Starts to cry]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Okay, I, I'm going to get it, see? [Walks off-screen, and comes back with a washing machine] Cheer up, Mr. Krabs, Here's that washing machine you wanted.
Mr. Krabs: Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!
SpongeBob: See?! You just did it again!
Mr. Krabs: Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money. [SpongeBob gets a blank expression on his face] Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think? [screams] Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet! [During SpongeBob's rage, Mrs. Puff looks up these words in the dictionary that Mr. Krabs bought her, and gasps and blushes. SpongeBob angrily walks past Mrs. Puff while muttering, and Mr. Krabs' mouth is agape]
Mrs. Puff: I didn't know SpongeBob had such a colorful vocabulary. Actually, there's something I'd like to say, too, Mr. Krabs. [Takes off her fur coat, shoes and hat] I'm afraid I just don't feel comfortable accepting all these gifts. I'd rather go Dutch, if you don't mind. [Hands him some money from her purse]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, okay.
Mrs. Puff: You're a very sweet man, Mr. Krabs. [Mrs. Puff kisses him and his eyes bend into the shape of a heart]
Mr. Krabs: [as his eyes make a heart] Aawww...


[SpongeBob and Squidward are walking down the road towards the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: So, I was all ready to drain the fries, but I cooked the fries slightly too long! So...
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: So, here's where the bizarre twist comes in.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: They weren't overcooked at all!
Squidward: SpongeBob, look! [picks him up and turns him around where we are shown a tall building]
SpongeBob: Wow, what happened to the Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!
SpongeBob: Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request." Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger! [takes out a whole burger from inside his body] If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born.
Squidward: Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish. [jellyfish stings Squidward on the head, forming a bump] See?!
SpongeBob: [pushes the bump in and it goes to the other side of Squidward's head] Ooh!
Mr. Krabs: Come inside. [now inside Krusty Towers] Isn't it beautiful?
Squidward: Where are all the new hotel employees? [Mr. Krabs throws uniforms onto Squidward &amp; SpongeBob. Dave enters]
Mr. Krabs: My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in. [walks behind desk] Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request."
Dave: Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles.
Mr. Krabs: If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service.
Dave: [looks at watch] Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch. [sighs and leaves]
Squidward: Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Squidward, you man the front desk.
Patrick: I'd like a Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service.
Patrick: Okay, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?
Squidward: Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?
Patrick: Sometimes I just need to get away from it all. [rings bell] Wow, this hotel has everything!
Squidward: [takes bell] Gimme that! Now sign the register.
Patrick: I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study! [cries]
Squidward: Patrick, all you have to do is write your name.
Patrick: Oh, okay. [takes pen] Do you mind?! [Squidward turns around so Patrick starts writing. Squidward peeks] Don't look! [Squidward turns around] Done! [Patrick has drawn a giant monster doodle of himself fighting three attack planes.]
Squidward: Close enough. Here's your room key.
Patrick: I'll need some help with my bags.
Squidward: How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!
Patrick: This is a hotel?
Squidward: [groans] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?
Squidward: Take Patrick and his bags to his room.
Patrick: What about my Krabby Patty?
Squidward: And bring him a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty. [he exits]
Squidward: Oh, Mr Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor? [mocking Squidward] I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
Squidward: Fine. Let's go, Patrick. [has struggle with Patrick's bags as he is walking up to the elevator]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the elevator] This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator. [Squidward walks to the other elevator, which turns out to be stairs. He grumbles because of this. Squidward walks up stairs as Patrick gets off the guest elevator]
Squidward: What's in these bags, rocks? [bag opens, spilling out rocks] Hey, these are rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?
Patrick: I don't tell you how to live your life!
Squidward: Well, here's your room.
Patrick: Wow.
Squidward: Enjoy your stay.
Patrick: Squidward, wait! [takes out a rock from his pocket and gives it to Squidward as a tip] Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from.
SpongeBob: Your Krabby Patty, sir. [Squidward attempting to throw the rock that Patrick gave to him as a tip] Hey, Squidward, cool rock.
Patrick: Hold on a second, SpongeBob. [hands SpongeBob a dollar, Squidward makes a surprise face, then scowls] Here you are, my good man.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you, Patrick!
Patrick: There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend [Squidward looks at his rock and becomes frustrated] Squidward!
Squidward: What now?!
Patrick: I don't like crusts on my sandwich!
Squidward: It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?
Patrick: Peel it.
Squidward: [peels the skin off the bun angrily] Happy? [Patrick inhales the patty]
SpongeBob: Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered.
Patrick: Could you do one more thing for me?
Squidward: Why don't you ask SpongeBob?
Patrick: Good idea, Squidward!
SpongeBob: How may I serve you, sir?
Patrick: I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.
SpongeBob: Oh, yes, sir! [both of them eat a bunch of Krabby Patties. As Squidward heads down the employee elevator, Mr. Krabs is on the phone]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help.
Squidward: What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?
Mr. Krabs: He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.
[Squidward is unclogging the toilet when he unclogs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward! [Squidward puts him back in the toilet. Patrick flushes]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!
Mr. Krabs: He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Deny no guests! [phone rings] Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there.
Squidward: [Scene transits to bubbles floating from a bathtub] A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!
Patrick: Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean.
Squidward: That's it! I've had enough!
Patrick: Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!
Mr. Krabs: [Squidward comes out of the guest elevator] Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!
Squidward: Not anymore. I quit. [Squidward throws his uniform on Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Quit? You can't quit. [Squidward walks out naked and reenters with Hawaiian-styled clothes. Squidward rings the bell] Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!
Squidward: One room, please. On the top floor.
Mr. Krabs: What do you think you're doing?
Squidward: I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where "we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request."
Mr. Krabs: I don't have to rent you a room!
Squidward: I've got cash.
Mr. Krabs: Oh... here's your room key.
Squidward: SpongeBob, carry my things to my room.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, guest sir. [turns legs into rockets and blasts off through the ceiling]
Squidward: [talking to Mr. Krabs] And you can carry me to my room.
Mr. Krabs: And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken.
Squidward: The plaque. [plaque is shown. Mr. Krabs has just finished carrying Squidward from the employee elevator] Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee.
SpongeBob: Your room, sir.
Squidward: And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hair.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] You've got to be kidding me!
Squidward: And I want it here in five seconds.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [runs off and comes back with a Krabby Patty in less than two seconds] Here you are, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it.
Squidward: Oh, I'm not going to eat this. You are.
Mr. Krabs: What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!
SpongeBob: Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward. [eats Krabby Patty, then spits it out, showing his tongue covered with toenails and nose hair. Squidward laughs] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese.
Patrick: [everything in Patrick's room is covered in cheese because apparently he asked for his room to be covered with cheese earlier] Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: [phone rings] What is it, Squidward?
Squidward: Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.
Mr. Krabs: [at Squidward's room] Here's your homemade cookies.
Squidward: [tries one and spits it out] These don't taste anything like mom used to make!
Mr. Krabs: Well, how did your mother make 'em?
Squidward: How should I know?! Ask my mother! [slams the door]
Mrs. Tentacles: [doorbell rings] Hello? [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are in ski masks]
Mr. Krabs: [trying to get a big sack in the trunk, but the door won't close] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob hits the sack with a shovel, but the trunk still won't close]
SpongeBob: No good, Mr. Krabs.
Mrs. Tentacles: Allow me, boy. [closes the trunk door]
Mr. Krabs: Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk...
SpongeBob: There's room for you to sit up front!
Mrs. Tentacles: Let's go bake some cookies, boys.
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: [in Squidward's room where Squidward is sampling the cookies] Well?
Squidward: I'm impressed! These are just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.
Mr. Krabs: So you're all taken care of?
Squidward: Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice.
Mr. Krabs: What?
Squidward: "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request." [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob change the room to a blue theme, a modern theme, a country theme, a torture theme, and then back to the original] Perfect!
Mr. Krabs: This room is exactly the same as when we started!
Squidward: Nothing like getting back to the basics.
Mr. Krabs: Let's get out of here, SpongeBob!
Squidward: Oh, before you leave, I want to go swimming.
Mr. Krabs: The pool's out back!
Squidward: Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim. [big swimming pool is now inside the room] Come on in, the water's fine. [SpongeBob jumps in]
Mr. Krabs: Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?
Squidward: Nope, that's it.
Mr. Krabs: You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!
Squidward: No, I'm good.
SpongeBob: Me, too.
Patrick: Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place is fancy! [gets on diving board] Cannonball! [jumps in, but the pool collapses the hotel back into the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [at hospital with the gang] Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start.
Patrick: That was a hotel?
Nurse: Your bill, sir.
Mr. Krabs: $15,000?! [he then acts as if he is having a heart attack]
Squidward: You're not going to have a heart attack, are you?
Mr. Krabs: Not at these prices! Forget hotels. This hospital rack is where the money is!
Patrick: This is a hospital?
Mr. Krabs: Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Hooray!
Squidward: [plaintively] Oh, boy.


[the episode opens up on the island of Bikini Atoll, where a crane of a ship holds a crate. The rope breaks, decelerating the supply of fortune cookies down to Bikini Bottom]
SpongeBob: Whoa, look at that cloud, Gary! It looks just like a giraffe eating ice cream.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary, all this cloud-watching is making me hungry too. Ooh, look at that big one, Gary!
Gary: [gets shocked] Meow!
SpongeBob: It's getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, [Gary yowls as he slowly crawls away] and bigger, and— ow! [SpongeBob gets crushed by the giant box of fortune cookies]
Gary: Meow. [sniffs the box]
SpongeBob: [emerges from the sand] Hey Gary, that was a pretty heavy cloud.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary, it's not a cloud at all. [SpongeBob pushes himself out of the sand] Let's see what's inside. [SpongeBob then removes a piece of the box and releases all of the fortune cookies] Whoo, fortune cookies! Vague prophecies baked into delicious bite-sized snacks. These cookies can see the future, Gary, which means they knew we were hungry, even before we did. Let's eat!
[SpongeBob and Gary begin eating the fortune cookies. SpongeBob opens his fortune and starts reading it]
SpongeBob: "A great fortune has fallen upon you." [gasps] Did you hear that Gary, the fortune is true! Let's look at your future. [Gary hands SpongeBob his fortune] "Happy trails will follow you always." [gasps and points at Gary's slime trail] Your fortune came true too!
[Gary then looks behind him to gaze at his trail]
SpongeBob: Cookies with fortunes that actually come true? We have to share these with everybody!
[the scene transitions to the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is declining SpongeBob's idea]
Mr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob, we are not handing out anything free with every purchase! Even the smiles here cost a nickel.
SpongeBob: Aw, why not, Mr. Krabs?
Squidward: [chuckles] Because, SpongeBob, fortune cookie fortunes are always lame and they never come true.
SpongeBob: Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Squidward. These fortune cookies are different, try one. [Hands him the fortune cookie]
Squidward: [backs it away] No. [SpongeBob pushes it back to him] Way.
[SpongeBob forces Squidward to eat the cookie by controlling his arms and shoving the cookie in his mouth. The fortune exits Squidward's mouth like a receipt and he reluctantly reads it]
Squidward: "You will be rewarded for your particular talent." Right. [SpongeBob turns Squidward around]
French Purser: Excuse me, Mr. Squidward Tentacles, you have just won the most miserable cashier in Bikini Bottom contest. Here is your cash prize! [Hands Squidward the money and begins celebrating]
Squidward: Holy harpoons, the fortune did come true!
Mr. Krabs: [snatches the money] Me cash register, me money. [walks away]
Squidward: And that's why my depression is award-winning.
SpongeBob: [Mr. Krabs shoving money into his pants] Don't you see, Mr. Krabs, the fortunes in those cookies are real. Can't we share them with everyone?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps and coughs] You know, you're right, SpongeBob. [pledging] We will share these magical macaroons with all the folks in Bikini Bottom. You just leave it to me.
SpongeBob: [jumps in excitement] All right!
Squidward: [throws confetti] Hooray. [tilts head down]
Mr. Krabs: [as he is ready to give free fortune cookies to his customers] This is how you hook them! [shoves a funnel in SpongeBob's pore] Now remember, the first one is free! [grabs a load of fortune cookies and implants them into SpongeBob to throw out to the customers]
Dale: [opens and eats a cookie, then reads fortune] "Something wonderful is about to happen to you." [gets licked by a group of worm puppies then giggles] I love puppies. Thanks, fortune cookie!
Mable-Monica: "Eat your hat and you will fall in love." [takes her hat off to eat and sees Lenny eating his hat. They both run to each other, dancing and kissing]
Mable-Monica and Lenny: Thanks  fortune cookie!
Ivy: "You will soon injure your legs?!" [Piano crashes down on Ivy's legs] My legs! I was looking for an excuse to get out of jury duty. [plays piano] Thanks fortune cookie!
SpongeBob: Those fortune cookies are a hit. [the crowd then runs towards him, knocking him down. A crowd is shown outside the Krusty Krab, which attracts Plankton's attention]
Plankton: [while riding a small chopper] Fortune cookies at the Krusty Krab, aye? Well, Eugene, I have a prediction too. You are in for an epic fail supreme with extra cheese! [evil laugh]
Karen: Sheldon! Where are you!?
[Plankton then flies away only to hit the fist and he falls into the Chum Bucket, landing in front of Karen]
Plankton: Barnacles, woman, would it kill you to leave me alone for five minutes?!
Karen: Sorry, your lordship, but the garbage isn't going to take itself out. [drops the garbage bag on Plankton, smashing him]
Plankton: [slips out from under bag] Riddle me this, computer wife, what's hollow, full of lies, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth?
Karen: Our marriage? [she then shows an image of a wedding ring]
Plankton: No! Fortune cookies. And Krabs is raking it in right now because all of his fortunes are actually coming true?! So...
Karen: [imitating Plankton] So, you got an evil plan to get the Krabby Patty secret formula and soon it will be yours, all yours. [evil imitated laugh]
Plankton: [surprised] Wow, I can't tell if you're sarcastic or psychic.
Karen: Ugh. [rolls eyes]
[the scene transitions to a chuckling Plankton, who is creating fortune cookies with bad messages in them]
Plankton: This will be a good one, [types] "You stink." [evil laugh while Karen is packaging the cookies]
[the scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, where Plankton is bringing in a load of bad fortune cookies and vaporizes the original ones]
Plankton: Enjoy your new fortune cookies, Krabs!
SpongeBob: [singing] Time for a refill. [takes the load of bad fortune cookies to the Krusty Krab]
[the Krusty Krab is loaded, Mr. Krabs' eyes turn to dollar signs, and Squidward is selling the cookies without a break]
Lenny: What is my future?
Squidward: [his tentacle cracks] My tentacles are going to fall off if I don't get a break soon, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [pushes Squidward away] Look out, Mr. Squidward, I'll teach ya how to run a cash register. [pacing to put the money in the register and runs out of fortune cookies] Huh? More cookies, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Fortunes flying in, Mr. Krabs. [drops a load of cookies]
Plankton: Let the wave of misfortune begin. [chuckles as he flies away]
Dale: "You will get stomach cramps from the Krusty Krab?!"
Mable: "The octopus with the big nose just spit in your food?!" [Squidward wipes his nose]
Frankie Billy: "A yellow sponge will serve you salmonella?!"
Ivy: "You will live forever if you eat at the Chum Bucket?!" [Crowd gasps]
Susie Rechid: Let's eat at the Chum Bucket. [crowd agrees, runs over SpongeBob who is mopping the floor, and runs down to the Chum Bucket]
[Mr. Krabs loses his customers, causing his dollar eye pupils to turn to cents. The two cents fall to the cash register and Mr. Krabs closes it. The "no sale" sign appears in the register. The scene transitions to the Chum Bucket, where it is jam-packed with customers]
Mr. Krabs: [Plankton holds a fortune cookie as he secretly jumps on the chair] What did we ever do to those fortune cookies to make them lie about us like that?
SpongeBob: Well, the fortunes in those cookies were always right before. [Plankton jumps in the fortune cookie bowl] Here Mr. Krabs, maybe this next one will change your luck.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs picks up a cookie, secretly given to him by Plankton, opens it, and starts reading the fortune teller] "Unless you give a tiny copepod the Krabby Patty secret formula, you will die?!"
Plankton: [opera voice] Hello! [normal voice] Did someone say copepod?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs shriek, and starts running with fear to his office, where SpongeBob locks the door and Mr. Krabs puts a plank in the way]
Plankton: Just wanted to borrow a cup of grease, Eugene. I'll come back later, ciao!
Mr. Krabs: [nervously speaking] J-just how true are these cookie fortunes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: If the cookie says it's true, then it's true. Horribly, terribly, truthfully, true! [begins wailing]
Mr. Krabs: "You will die." [the world "die" echoes in his head three times, leading to a vision of Mr. Krabs' funeral service]
Pearl: [sobbing] Oh, I'll miss you, daddy! [continues sobbing then she takes his wallet] But I really can't wait to spend your hard-earned money on shoes! [laughs and runs away]
Mr. Krabs: [wakes up] Me money!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! No! [weeping tears and filling up Mr. Krabs' coffin, causing him to float down and hit his head on the floor. Vision ends]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs, it's time. [SpongeBob's arm breaks off while holding on to Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs gets scared as SpongeBob appears on his other side] It's time to give up the secret formula to Plankton! [puts back his arm] Because your life is worth more than some scrap of paper in a bottle.
Mr. Krabs: You're right, me boy-o, [heads toward his safe] I've got to face me fortune. [takes secret formula out of safe]
[the transition cuts to the Chum Bucket, where Karen is controlling the crowd]
Karen: Don't crowd, there's more Chumbalaya where that came from, unfortunately. [Plankton is feeding the customers]
Crowd: [gags]
Frankie Billy: "It's worth it to live forever."
Plankton: The scheme is working perfectly, [sees Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob approaching the Chum Bucket] and here comes gullible Krabs now to hand-deliver the secret formula. [tears up] I promised myself I wouldn't cry. [chuckles]
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are having trouble getting inside the Chum Bucket]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this crowd is impossible!
SpongeBob: [snatches secret formula] Leave it to me, Mr. Krabs. I'll make sure Plankton gets his so you won't get yours. [prepares to run to the crowd] Hot stuff comin' through! [jumps inside the crowd. Places the secret formula on his head then he swims through the crowd to Plankton but he sinks]
Plankton: Don't worry, secret formula, I'm comin', baby!
[Plankton then jumps in his boat to grab the secret formula, but SpongeBob is off-balance, so Plankton uses his fishing rod to grab the formula]
Plankton: Me want that papa! [SpongeBob lands on Plankton, destroying the boat]
SpongeBob: [hands out formula] Here Plankton, Mr. Krabs wants you to have this.
Plankton: [chuckles] Finally! [Plankton reaches for formula, but an anchovy sticks his head up, knocking the formula away] No! [he jumps to the floor where he finds it rolling] Ah-hah. [the bottle is kicked towards him, which flattens him out. He gets up, balances on the bottle, but then is kicked to the ground. Plankton then tries to run from a customer wearing large, green boots, but he gets stepped on. Plankton's squashed body gets up from the ground] I have had enough! [still, in a squished form, he rolls to a chum bucket] Get out of my restaurant, you mindless sheep! I wrote those fortunes, [crowd gasps] they were fakes, don't you get it?! Now all of you, out! [growling]
Dale: Let's go back to the Krusty Krab! [crowd agrees and starts running back to the Krusty Krab]
[Mr. Krabs receives his formula back]
Plankton: I guess I didn't really think that through.
Mr. Krabs: I figured the funeral fortune was phony, Plankton.
Plankton: Oh, yeah?! What are you going to do about it, Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, Sheldon. [holds a fortune cookie] Here, have a fortune cookie. [gives Plankton the fortune cookie]
Plankton: [opens fortune cookie and starts reading the fortune teller] Eh. "You will go on a long voyage where you will get everything you deserve." [gets picked up by Mr. Krabs] Hey!
[the ending follows to a Chinese restaurant where Plankton pops out of a fortune cookie and is avoiding the chopsticks]
Plankton: Ahh! Hey! [gets grabbed by the chopsticks] Ooh! Mommy! [a chomping noise is heard]


[The episode opens with the crowd attending the grand opening of Larry's Gym.]
Larry: What you see before you is the culmination of my lifelong dream! A place of my own where I can work out everyday and anytime I want, Larry's Gym!
[The crowd is cheering again. Larry pulls out some scissors and cuts the ribbon. Then he throws the scissors away.]
Larry: Looking out at this sea of plastic muscles and sagging flesh. Frankly, I'm disgusted.
[The crowd appear in flappy looks.]
Crowd: Awwww!
Larry: Therefore, I'm now opening the gym to everyone in Bikini Bottom!
[The crowd cheers for the third time.]
Larry: For the price of a lifetime membership!
[Larry points to the lifetime membership booth.]
Crowd: Awww! [looks down]
Larry: But today everything is free!
[The crowd cheers and runs into gym.]
Larry's #1 Fan: Shape us and mold us in your image!
Frankie Billy: [appears with scissors through his head] You're the lobster, Larry! The Alpha Lobster!
Larry: Well, I don't know if I'll say that! [buffs up]
Lloyd-Rich: Oh, I filled out a membership form! [hands form to Larry]
Nat Peterson: Me too! [hands form to Larry]
Larry: What's in that pink box?
Nat Peterson: Um, donuts sir?
[Larry throws away the box of donuts.]
Larry: Do-nut brings those in here! In the meantime, enjoy yourself because your first visit is free!
[Mr. Krabs magically appears out of nowhere.]
Mr. Krabs: Is it true that everything is free?
Larry: That's right, sir! For your first visit we-
[Mr. Krabs runs off and disappears.]
Larry: Hello? In conclusion, I'm at your service to turn anyone anyone into a ripped heap of muscle glory! [buffs up once more]  
[SpongeBob is struggling to open the doors.]
Larry: Boy, I've got my work cut out for me.
[SpongeBob gets his hands stuck inside of the doors.]
Larry: The doors are automatic. Just step on the mat.
SpongeBob: Oh!
[SpongeBob jumps up and down trying to activate the automatic door.]
Larry: [grunts] Here!
[Larry steps on the mat and opens the door.]
SpongeBob: Aah! Thanks, Larry!
[Larry sighs and notices Mr. Krabs carrying an exercise bicycle on his back as he leaves the gym.]
Larry: Uh, what are you doing?
Mr. Krabs: You said everything was free.
Larry: [laughs] No, no. Your first visit is free.
Mr. Krabs: So what you're saying is if I never leave, it will be free forever!
[Mr. Krabs walks back inside with the exercise bicycle.]
Larry: [laughs] Time to go live the dream! Right after I... file this paperwork.
[Close-up of paperwork.]
Larry: [while reading some of the paperwork] I didn't think there'd be so much of it.
[Larry drops his head down on the desk in disgust.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Larry. I was just working out and I was wondering. Is this normal?
[SpongeBob's legs are all cramped up. Larry freaks out.]
Larry: Even your cramps have cramps! You need to follow my number 1 rule. [pulls out water bottle] Always be hydrating.
[Larry gives SpongeBob the water bottle. As SpongeBob drinks it, his legs become straight again.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Larry. You think I'll ever be as strong as you?
Larry: Sure! [picks up SpongeBob] What kind of a gym owner would I be if I couldn't take a puny, squishy lump like you?
[SpongeBob slides off of Larry's claw.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Squishy.
Larry: [sighs] What I'm saying is I can make you a man.
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Larry: I'm gonna make you my personal project. Of course, you'll have to sign up for a lifetime membership. [holds up membership papers]
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
[Larry drops the membership papers on SpongeBob's hands and drops a pencil next to him. SpongeBob struggles to lift a pencil.]
Larry: That reminds me. You need to start hydrating right now!
[SpongeBob signs the papers at a fast pace and becomes very tired.]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir!
[SpongeBob drinks more water.]
Larry: And remember: always be hydrating!
SpongeBob: Ok, I will!
[SpongeBob drinks more water at a fast pace.]
Larry: That's what I like to see! Come on, we'll finish those later.
SpongeBob: Good. 'Cause I was really crashing here. Signing those papers. [walks with Larry to the exercise room] Feelin' the burn? Is that what you call it? I heard Angel singing, "Beautiful Angel". That's normal, right?
Frank (muscular goldfish): It's Larry, King of the Gym!
[The crowd cheers.]
Larry: Oh, you guys. I'm just an ordinary Alpha Lobster doing his job. Towel boy!
[Frankie Billy shows up holding towels. Larry pulls out a shining crown.]
Larry: Polish this crown for me. Will you?
[Larry give Frankie Billy his crown and Frankie Billy walks off.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Join us, boy! Ho-ho! I can't believe I'm allowed to lift these... [tries to lift weights with a barbell] really heavy... pieces of metal for free!
[The heavy weight of the barbell snaps Mr. Krabs' arms and it falls on his chest.]
Mr. Krabs: Ow! Free!
[Mr. Krabs' shell breaks into pieces, revealing his pink skin and leaving Mr. Krabs dazed.]
SpongeBob: I don't know, Larry. I'm not good at lifting things.
French Narrator: Flashback...
[The flashback shows SpongeBob trying to lift a bag of snail food while feeding Gary, which ends up pulling his arms off. Then it shows SpongeBob trying to lift a bag of groceries that was given from an old lady, which also resulted in pulling his arms off. Then it showed SpongeBob trying to lift his pillow while going to bed, which also resulted in pulling his arms off. And finally, it showed SpongeBob, after warming himself up, trying to lift the pile of arms he lost, which also resulted in pulling his arms off.]
French Narrator: End of flashback...
Larry: Let me see. I may have something that'll work for you.
[Larry looks through his cabinet and picks up a box of cotton swabs.]
Larry: Here we go. Cotton swabs. [takes a cotton swab stick] Cotton balls. [sticks two cotton balls on each end] Here. Try this on for size, Hercules.
[Larry gives SpongeBob the cotton swab with the cotton balls on it. SpongeBob tries to lift it but ends up pulling his arms off.]
SpongeBob: How am I doing?
Larry: Pathetic.
SpongeBob: [talks with a jug of water in mouth] Look, Larry! I hydrating! Oh, I am hydrating so much!
[SpongeBob drinks the water from the jug.]
Larry: Yeah, I've got another idea, SpongeBob. Come with me.
[SpongeBob regrows his arms and follows Larry as he drinks the water. Larry and SpongeBob enter another exercise room.]
Larry: First thing tomorrow morning, this is gonna be where I leave my exercise class.
SpongeBob: I'll be there!
Larry: That's the spirit! And we're going to get you started early. Let me see some crunches!
[SpongeBob is seen munching on some kelpo cereal. Larry pulls the cereal box away.]
Larry: The only thing I wanna see in your mouth is that water bottle! [stuffs a water bottle in SpongeBob's mouth] Now what did I tell you? Always be hydrated! Now, I'll show you some crunches! [does sit-ups] Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow!
SpongeBob: Oh, I can do that. That's what I do when I laugh. [laughs when bending over] Only now, I'll do it on my back.
[SpongeBob flips and lands on his back. Then he does sit-ups while laughing.]
Larry: Could you do it without the laugh?
SpongeBob: I won't lie to you, Larry. Probably not. [laughs]
Larry: Whatever works I guess. Keep up with that and most importantly...
SpongeBob: Always be hydrating.
[SpongeBob sticks a jug of water on his head and does sit-ups while laughing.]
Larry: [sighs] Ok. I have a lot of paperwork to catch up on.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs rubbing a towel on himself at the front desk while Larry is working on the paperwork.]
Mr. Krabs: Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free! Free!
Larry: Do you have to do that in front of me?
Mr. Krabs: Yes! Yes I do! [throws the towel in Larry's face] Because I sincerely want to thank you for a truly life-changing experience! Sucker!
[Mr. Krabs laughs as he walks away. Larry gets off his desk and attempts to pick up the towels Mr. Krabs threw. But as he bends over, he back cracks and his belly pops out, freaking out a passing customer.]
Mr. Krabs: Nice potbelly!
Larry: Potbelly? [pokes his belly]
[Larry hears SpongeBob laughing.]
Larry: Oh, I forgot all about my prodigy.
[Larry enters the gym and a shadow creeps down on him.]
Larry: [gasps] Oh my Neptune!
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab where the hungry customers are complaining about not getting their food. In the kitchen, SpongeBob attempts to do his job as a fry cook. But due to his newly massive strength and buffed up body, everything he touches ends up getting crushed and stepped on.]
SpongeBob: Aw! That's gonna come out of my paycheck!
[SpongeBob goes to lift the patties, but ends up lifting the stove. The stove flies out of the restaurant and lands on Frankie Billy who is driving his boat.]
Frankie Billy: My legs! [boat explodes] I'm ok! [the stove lands on him] Slightly less ok!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob walks through the wall.]
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Squidward: What are you... Whoa! You've been working out.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I hope you have some glue for me because I am ripped!
[SpongeBob's muscle punches Squidward's face. The muscles on his belly become six sponges popping up and down. The muscle on his right leg turns into a solid gold block. SpongeBob's nose reflexes.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm late for the gym! Can you cover for me in the kitchen, Squidward?
Squidward: Yes! Anything you meathead! Just go before you destroy the place!
[SpongeBob runs off to Larry's gym as Squidward's face pops back out. The scene changes to people coming in and out of the gym. Larry, who is now extremely obese, is still at his desk working on his paperwork.]
SpongeBob: Larry?
[Larry stands up and all of the papers fly around.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Larry. You've really let yourself go.
Larry: With all this paperwork, I haven't had any time to do my crunches. The only thing I've been crunching is numbers. But I'm gonna get back in shape. You'll see.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Larry! Sure you will!
Larry: SpongeBob, tell me the truth. [shows SpongeBob his belly] Do I have a potbelly?
[SpongeBob freaks out a bit.]
SpongeBob: No, Larry. Don't be silly. You don't have a potbelly.
[SpongeBob is almost about to laugh but keeps his cool.]
Larry: [sighs] See you in exercise class. I guess.
[SpongeBob goes to the exercise room and Larry begins to cry in agony. As he cries, his tears fall into the opening of his round belly. Mr. Krabs shows up with a spoon.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh boy! Free soup! [tastes a sample of Larry's tears] Little heavy on the salt.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and everyone in the exercise room getting ready for class.]
SpongeBob: Oh, he'll be here. Don't worry. Larry made me the man I am today.
[The crowd murmurs in amazement.]
SpongeBob: I taught me just do stuff you'll always do, but do it on your back. Laugh on your back. [does sit-ups as he laughs]
[The crowd does the same thing.]
SpongeBob: [lays on his back and moves his legs in the air] Walk on your back.
[The crowd also does the same thing.]
SpongeBob: And don't forget. Always be hydrated. That means drink plenty of water.
[SpongeBob pours water on his head with a water bottle and the crowd did the same thing.]
SpongeBob: I hope Larry's ok. But while we're waiting, I guess we could ride bicycles on our backs.
[SpongeBob lays on his back and pretends to ride a bicycle. The crowd does the same thing. Through the window of the exercise room, a depressed Larry is watching from the outside. He thinks that SpongeBob is a well better instructor than he is and sadly walks by the steam room. Mr. Krabs pops out of the steam room.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker.
[Mr. Krabs pops back in the steam room. Larry sighs in depression and heads back to his desk. He drinks some coffee. He takes a pencil and attempts to break it. But due to is decreased muscle strength, he couldn't break it. He then tries to lift weights with another pencil but with donuts on each end. However, he couldn't do it because of his loss in muscle strength.]
Larry: Oh, what's the use.
[Larry eats a donut and drops his face flat on his desk.]
Larry: Oh, who am I kidding!
[SpongeBob arrives on an exercise bike.]
SpongeBob: You wanted to see me, sir?
Larry: Yeah. [eats other donut] Look, uh, you're obviously the alpha male at the gym now and I'm just a shell of my former self.
SpongeBob: I hear ya, Larry. I just wanna get back to the Krusty...
Larry: I need you to take over. You're a natural leader, SpongeBob. [puts the crown on SpongeBob's head] You should be in charge of the fun stuff while I sit here in the reception area slowly getting fatter and paler until I die.
SpongeBob: This sounds great.
[Larry begins to cry.]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Oh, Larry, look at me! I'm too big to work the grill anymore! That makes me sad!
Larry: Come over here and give me a bro-hug!
[The crown falls off of SpongeBob's head.]
SpongeBob: You mean a br-ug?
Larry: I don't wanna call it that.
SpongeBob: Here's to our new lives! Our terrible, terrible new lives!
[SpongeBob and Larry hug each other and cried in despair. But they hug and cry, water spews out of SpongeBob and he shrinks back to his normal size.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, what happened?
Larry: Dude, you were just overhydrated! Those weren't real muscles, they were water muscles!
SpongeBob: Larry, your br-ug was so super strong, it took the water muscles right out of me!
Larry: Don't say br-ug.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Br-ug. [laughs]
[SpongeBob slides off of Larry's claws and SpongeBob does his sit-ups while laughing. Larry does the same exact thing and in the process, his muscles begin to build up and his strength returns to normal.]
Larry: SpongeBob, laughing on my back was just what I needed! [buffs up] You're a pretty good instructor after all. [sits down] Oh boy. The way you laugh really gets on my nerves.
[SpongeBob continues to laugh as he does his sit-ups.]
French Narrator: The very next evening...
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab late at night. SpongeBob is happily flipping the patties on the grill.]
Squidward: Well, that was the last customer, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob places his two spatulas in his pockets.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what a great day.
Squidward: And you know why it was a great day? Because Krabs never even showed up.
[The scene changes to Larry's gym getting ready to close up for the night. Larry is walking by the steam room until he sees steam coming out.]
Larry: Huh? [sniffs] What is that smell? [jiggles the doorknob] Mr. Krabs, how long have you been in there?!
[Larry pulls the door off and sees Mr. Krabs as a cooked up crab on a plate with melted butter and lemons on the side, meaning that he had been in the steam room too long.]
Mr. Krabs: I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?
[The episode ends.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. There is a long line of customers who are growing tired and impatient from Bubble Bass's order.]
Customers: Just go! Oh, no.
Bubble Bass: Yes, I will have a quad patty, with a sprinkling of Himalayan salt, smoked paprika, and micro greens.
Squidward: Gimme a quad—
Bubble Bass: Hold on. I'm not finished with my order.
Customers: Aw, come on! [some of them turn and leave]
Bubble Bass: I would like my patties be-cheesed, but not just any cheese will do. Have you any aged gouda? [the customers grumble] And yes, it is pronounced "how-uda," not "goo-da."
Mr. Krabs: [growls and taps Bubble Bass's shoulder] Just eat the regular Krabby Patty [shoves a Krabby Patty in Bubble Bass's mouth] and stop wasting everybody's time!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! You know we don't treat our customers like that. [Mr. Krabs is stunned] It says right here, in the Krusty Krab manual. [clears throat and reads] "The customer is always right, when they have money."
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Such wise and beautiful words. Thanks for reminding me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I'm here to serve, Mr. Krabs. [accidentally splatters a dropping of ketchup on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: [growls and screams] Ketchup waster! [SpongeBob whimpers] Oh! Sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't mean it. No more outbursts. I'll be nice Mr. Krabs, I promise.
Squidward: Your napkin. [gives Bubble Bass a napkin, but drops it]
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Waster!
[Mr. Krabs jumps into the cashier boat, but Squidward climbs out and runs away. Mr. Krabs gives Squidward a chase around the restaurant as he rows the cashier boat. Squidward steps on SpongeBob as he runs.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? [gets run over by Mr. Krabs and the cashier boat] Ow! Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob grabs the cashier boat and his lower half follows] You gotta calm down!
[Mr. Krabs continues to chase Squidward all over the restaurant while dragging SpongeBob. During the chase, SpongeBob's arm entangles everything and every one of the customers inside. Moments later, Larry the Lobster enters the restaurant. Squidward hides behind Larry. Mr. Krabs crashes into Larry.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! [SpongeBob shouts as he crashes into Larry as well. Mr. Krabs, with SpongeBob on his back, and Squidward climb around Larry] I'll murder-lize him!
Larry: Relax, little crab guy.
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Get your muscled mitts off me! Get off! Get...[sighs happily]
Larry: That's right. Give in to the healing power of my pecs.
SpongeBob: I feel so secure.
Larry: [sighs] All better?
Squidward: What? You let him go? We're all dead! [shouts, crawls into the kitchen and gets burned by the grill] Ow! The grill's still on! [runs out of the kitchen and screams as he is burnt from the grill; SpongeBob splashes Squidward with water; Squidward slips and crashes into the table where Larry and Mr. Krabs are sitting in.]
Mr. Krabs: I don't know what's wrong with me. The Krusty Krab's just been so busy. I never seem to get a break.
Larry: Sounds like someone needs a vacation.
Mr. Krabs: I—I could use some me time.
SpongeBob: And don't worry. Squidward and I can take care of the Krusty Krab while you're gone.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm...
[Mr. Krabs imagines the Krusty Krab completely burnt down with SpongeBob standing in the middle.]
SpongeBob: Order up! [the patty disintegrates]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] I'm sorry, but I can't leave you guys in charge. I need a strong man to run this place—someone who's a rock and can really handle the load, you know? But who has that kind of strength, hmm?
[While Mr. Krabs is talking, Larry lifts him up and down with his claw.]
SpongeBob: Psst, psst! [points to Larry as he stammers excitedly]
Mr. Krabs: That's it! Larry, how would you like to manage the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation?
Larry: Larry's got his own gym to run.
SpongeBob: Come on, Larry. It'll be fun.
Larry: Larry loves fun! I'm in.
Mr. Krabs: All right! Ah! [gives Larry a high-five, but his claw hits Squidward; he groans]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob continuing his work at the grill. Larry enters the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Larry. How you liking your new job?
Larry: Larry likes it just fine. But do the customers always eat like this?
[The customers obnoxiously eat their meals.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no. They normally eat like this! [grabs the patties from the grill and chews heavily on them]
Larry: Those poor people. Someone needs to whip them into shape.
[SpongeBob continues to chew heavily on the patties. He smiles as meat seeps through his teeth. The scene changes to Squidward taking a customer's order.]
Squidward: What'll you have?
Fred: Uh...I'll have a double Krabby Patty, Krabby fries, and uh—whoa! [gets grabbed by Larry and is put on a treadmill]
Squidward: What else?
Fred: Uh, uh—a Krabby soda...Uh, uh—a Krabby...[slips and falls off the treadmill] My leg!
Squidward: [laughs and gets strapped by a stretching band with a motor] Hey! [voice warbling] Can I help you?
Frank: [runs on treadmill] Yeah, I'll take a Krabby salad, dressing on the side, and 60 more minutes on this rad treadmill. [hands Squidward a dollar]
Squidward: [warbling] Here's your change.
[The scene changes to Larry putting a patty on a weight.]
Larry: Here's your order, sir. [gives it to Octavius Rex] And don't forget your side salad! [gives it to Octavius Rex, but the weights are too heavy for him to carry]
Frank: Yeah! Push it, push it!
Larry: Push it, push it!
Octavius Rex: [grunts] Okay, okay. I'll push it. [pushes the weights to the table]
Larry: Push it, push it!
Frank: Yeah, push it!
[Octavius Rex pushes the weight onto the table.]
SpongeBob: Yes, you made it! Now, claim your Krabby Patty!
Octavius Rex: [weakly] Hooray...[drops his face on the salad]
SpongeBob: Aww, too pooped for a Krabby Patty.
Larry: Ah, forget Krabby Patties. Those things are over. [throws away the patty]
SpongeBob: But Larry, Krabby Patties are why people come here.
Larry: Ooh, not anymore. Now we only serve salads and protein power shakes!
SpongeBob: Ooh, power shake! I wanna taste. [takes a sip of the power shake, but spits it out onto the radio as it tasted terrible]
Larry: You like?
SpongeBob: No, Larry. No.
Larry: But it gets you jacked!
SpongeBob: I don't wanna be jacked. I just want my Krabby Patties back.
Larry: Everybody wants to get jacked.
Frank: Yeah, jacked!
[Larry and Frank buff themselves up and show off their muscles.]
SpongeBob: Look, Larry, I really think we should go back to serving Krabby Patties. People love the...
[Larry exhales and relaxes.]
SpongeBob: Larry?
Larry: [stammers] Jacked.
[The scene changes to Larry make some serious changes to the Krusty Krab. He turns the entire dining room into an obstacle course for the customers to run through. SpongeBob and Squidward are serving power shakes while customers run through the course.]
Larry: SpongeBob! Squidward! Let's move it, boys. Get those power shakes out and those heart rates up!
[SpongeBob and Squidward run to serve the power shakes to the customers. SpongeBob climbs the rope and serves the shake to Nat Peterson on the rock-climbing wall. But one of the shakes drops onto Nat Peterson and sends him falling off.]
SpongeBob: Sorry!
[Squidward jumps over some hurdles, but almost gets stepped on by Martin. He laughs in relief, but gets himself squashed by Bubble Bass.]
Squidward: Whoa!
Bubble Bass: [tastes the power shake] Oh! Horrible sustenance.
[SpongeBob cowers behind some weights as everyone in the Krusty Krab is being tortured and pummeled by the strong guys. It soon dawns on SpongeBob that Larry is literally turning the Krusty Krab into a gym. Squidward hides behind the weights with SpongeBob.]
Squidward: Let's get outta here!
[Squidward and SpongeBob run over to a rope net.]
SpongeBob: Pardon my reach.
[Squidward climbs over the rope net, but gets himself tangled in it. SpongeBob struggles to pull Squidward off.]
Squidward: Go on without me! [SpongeBob runs, but is grabbed by Squidward] No, wait, don't.
SpongeBob: Squidward, I know Larry means well, but he's messing up the Krusty Krab! This used to be a shrine to the delicious Krabby Patty. Now it's just a stinky gym.
Larry: [to Fred as he is doing weight-lifting with a salt shaker] Feel...the...burn!
[Fred lifts the barbell high. SpongeBob sprays some deodorant spray on Fred's armpit. The barbell drops on Fred's head and salt spills on his salad plate.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, go tell Larry he's fired.
Squidward: Are you crazy? He is way too big for that. We need to come at this another way—a smart, dignified way! I know—we'll sabotage the place. [a strong guy passes by, drinking a power shake] And I know just where to start: the power shakes.
SpongeBob: I'm on it! [giggles and runs off to the kitchen]
Squidward: Wait, wait—what about me?
SpongeBob: [adds butter to the blender] Butter! [adds lard to the blender] Lard! [adds mayonnaise to the blender] Mayonnaise. [grunts happily as he closes the blender lid]
[SpongeBob turns on the blender and all the ingredients blend together. Once it's done, SpongeBob scoops up some of the mixed up ingredients with a cup and dips it into the fryer.]
SpongeBob: And now, fry it all up into a greasy, heart-stopping surprise! [goes to serve the shake to Larry] Here you go.
[But instead of drinking it, Larry spreads the shake all over his pecs and rubs it like suntan lotion.]
Larry: I'm loving this oily concoction. It really makes Larry's muscles pop! [buffs up, grabs SpongeBob and rubs him over his pecs] Thanks, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob groans while being rubbed against Larry's pecs. SpongeBob slides off Larry and slides over to Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Okay, that failed. What now?
Squidward: We'll sabotage the weight machines. Then these muscle heads will have to find a new place to work out!
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [runs off]
Squidward: Wait, you idiot! Get me out of here.
[SpongeBob loosens up some nuts and bolts to make one of the weight-lifting machines fragile. Once he was done, Frank comes over to do some work out. He gets himself tangled in the weight machine, but the machine made him become stronger, even though SpongeBob sabotaged it. Frank breaks free and shows off his muscles.]
Frank: Awesome workout, bro!
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess this place belongs to the gym guys now. [takes off his hat and leaves]
Squidward: Don't leave me, SpongeBob! Wait, what am I saying?
[Outside, customers are crawling everywhere, dying of hunger.]
Customers: Help us! [groans and moans] Hungry!
[Sandals gnaws on his arm and Bubble Bass eats some sand.]
SpongeBob: What are you all doing out here? You should just go home.
Harold: We can't go home. There's no Krabby Patties at home. I need my Krabby Patties, man! [wailing] You gotta help me!
Customers: Help us! Help! Help!
SpongeBob: Krabby Patties—that's it! Those gym guys have forgotten the simple, greasy pleasure of munching on a Krabby Patty, and we need to remind them.
[The scene changes back inside. Larry and some other strong guys are doing some workouts, when suddenly, they hear something in the kitchen.]
Larry and the gym guys: Huh?
[The door opens. SpongeBob, Bubble Bass and the angry customers confront Larry and his gym guys.]
Larry: SpongeBob, you're ruining Larry's pump sesh.
SpongeBob: Larry, you're ruining the Krusty Krab!
Larry: Get 'em, men!
[Larry's gym guys charge at the customers.]
SpongeBob: Fire!
[The customers fire Krabby Patties with their slingshots. The patties fly into the mouths of the gym guys and they start eating them.]
Gym Guys: Mmm!
Frank: [growls as he corners Bubble Bass] Get over here! [Bubble Bass turns around and SpongeBob shots a patty in Frank's mouth] Mmm. Oh, gimme, gimme! [eats a platter of patties from Gus]
Squidward: Give him a single! Give him a double with cheese! [gets splattered in the face by a patty]
[Nat Peterson does his ninja-like moves while using ketchup and mustard bottles as nunchackus. Nat Peterson jumps in the air and SpongeBob swings on a rope, serving Krabby Patties to the gym guys.]
SpongeBob: Yeah!
[Nat Peterson sprays ketchup and mustard on the patties.]
Gym Guys: Huh? [munches on the patties]
SpongeBob: Give into the flavor, Larry!
Larry: [fights off with his barbells] Never!
SpongeBob: He's too fast. We need a distraction. [pulls out a barbell from his head] Here, use this. [gives it to Bubble Bass and he does some weight-lifting]
Larry: No, you gotta keep your elbow—[SpongeBob shoots a Krabby Patty into Larry's mouth and he chews on it; SpongeBob blows on his slingshot and Larry eventually gives in as he swallows the patty] Oh! Greasy, fatty, sticky, and gummy! It's delicious! Larry's been a fool. I've spent all my time working on my muscles when I could've been working on these delicious sandwiches. [sobbing] What's—what's wrong with me? [his pecs cry]
Bubble Bass: Now those are some sad pecs.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Larry] Aw, don't be sad, Larry. You were just trying to help people get into shape. [hands Larry a tissue and his pecs blow into it; three of Larry's gym guys eat Krabby Patties, but gain weight] Eh—looks like your gym has some new customers.
[The scene changes to Larry and the gym guys carrying their workout equipment out of the Krusty Krab. Squidward, on the other hand, is still tangled up in the rope net.]
Squidward: Somebody let me out of this thing already!
Mr. Krabs: [singing as he comes back from his vacation] Home sweet home. [enters the restaurant] Hmm?
[All of the customers including Patrick are gobbling down the Krabby Patties and things are now back to normal at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Order up! [slingshots a patty to Fred]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs happily] Everything's just how I left it.


SpongeBob: [Starts with scene of The Krusty Krab zooming in, then we see SpongeBob ringing the bell] Order up! Go now, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur. [blows a kiss then a heart pops up and Squidward accidentally swallows it and starts choking]
Squidward: It went in my mouth! Choking on sentiment! I think I'm poisoned!
SpongeBob: Well, okay, you sit this one out, Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef. [talking to customer] For your dining pleasure, two double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love. [reaches into his chest and pulls out a heart and sprinkles some of it on the Krabby Patties. He then pants] Enjoy your meal! [sighs] It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it, Squidward?
Squidward: [breathes] Oh, yeah, you really touched his life. [cuts to scene of customer eating his Krabby Patties like a pig]
SpongeBob: Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes.
Squidward: Quality food?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Good people?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [nods]
Squidward: Discriminating tastes?
SpongeBob: Testify!
Squidward: D'oh! [breathes angrily, then runs up to customer then takes a Krabby Patty] Only pathetic losers with horrible taste would eat this garbage! [Squidward takes away a Krabby Patty, then the customer cries]
SpongeBob: Squidward! The Krusty clientèle needs to be cuddled and treated with respect. [takes Krabby Patty from Squidward and puts it in customers mouth like a baby bottle] There, there. [to Squidward] Mr. Krabs will be ashamed! [Mr. Krabs walks in]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you filthy bilge rats!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: You got three seconds to get out of me restaurant before I kick you out! Fine, have it your way! [goes around to the back of the Krusty Krab and starts tipping it and all the customers fall out and then puts it back and walks into the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: What's happening, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Ah, we don't need those losers anymore! I'm turning the restaurant in to one of those fancy froufrou places, where they charge big bucks for itsy-bitsy portions!
Squidward: Fancy? Froufrou?
Mr. Krabs: We're getting a gourmet chef from the chef exchange program and I'm going to raise me prices to the roof! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Chef exchange program?
Mr. Krabs: [stops laughing] Oh. Uh, yeah. Well, you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes! [bus arrives] Heh, looks like it's early. [kicks SpongeBob into the bus and it drives off]
Squidward: It was that easy? All these years? [sniffles] I've underestimated the power of public transportation! [another bus arrives with Le Schnook on it]
Mr. Krabs: Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: Does your middle name happen to be "No SpongeBob within a thousand kilometers of here"? [he and Mr. Krabs laugh]
Le Schnook: I find you disgusting. [they stop laughing] However, my culture dictates zat I must kiss you regardless. [kisses Squidward on each cheek, then spits twice before doing the same with Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Well, he's just as affectionate as the boy.
Squidward: But the surly attitude he has is a step in the right direction! [cuts to scene of the bus dropping off SpongeBob at the Fancy! restaurant. SpongeBob then walks into the kitchen]
Fancy Head Chef: What is this rubbish?! I would not wipe my own bottom with this! [slaps Archie who is holding a steak] Start over! And this [drinks boiled water, then spits it on Paco] I would not wash my own bottom with this after carefully wiping and wiping and wiping! [slaps Paco] Now go stand in the corner and think about what you have done! [Paco walks away sadly] And where is my exchange chef?! 
SpongeBob: Um, right here, sir.
Fancy Head Chef: [laughs] There you are. Bonjour! [kisses SpongeBob two times, SpongeBob giggles and the chief slaps him] Now, get to your station and prepare me your best dish! [SpongeBob runs to a pot, puts some ingredients into it, then takes out a Krabby Patty and blows a kiss and a heart shows up. The chef then grabs it and crushes it] This is not funny! And I certainly did not exchange my top sous chef for a, how you say, comedian! [puts Krabby Patty in SpongeBob's mouth and then pulls is nose causing him to eat it] Prepare me a gourmet dish, NOW! [SpongeBob runs over to a counter with vegetables on it]
SpongeBob: [starts chopping vegetables] I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than... [chops vegetables into a Krabby Patty then laughs nervously] Just warming up. [Chief gets angry, he then screams than gets a tray of stuff and puts in in the oven] Come on, SpongeBob! [whistles and then takes out a Krabby Patty and throws it on the ground, Chief gets angry again, he then cracks an egg into a pan] Just one egg then... [egg turns into a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob gets mad and throws it on the ground along with many other Krabby Patties] No, that's not it, no...
Fancy Head Chef: You are making a mockery of my... [Krabby Patty accidentally lands in his mouth and he eats it] This taste is fantastic! What do you call it? [he then eats another one]
SpongeBob: A Krabby Patty.
Fancy Head Chef: [is eating more Krabby Patties] The whole world must taste this!
Narrator: Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab... [We see that the Krusty Krab is all decorated fancy]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward, look at this! [holds up a plate with a small fruit on it] We're charging 52 smackeroos for this little guy. [laughs and then Squidward smells its horrible odor]
Squidward: Oh! What is that?!
Mr. Krabs: I don't know! Some kind of bean paste or something.
Le Schnook: Wrong, monsieur! It is ze Rare Fruit of ze Kazook Tree.
Mr. Krabs: So it's supposed to smell like a rotten gym socks?
Le Schnook: Its naturally rancid odor can only be neutralized by shredded gold.
Mr. Krabs: Shredded... [gulps] gold? [Le Schnook then starts shredding gold with a cheese grater. Mr. Krabs screams and takes it away from him] Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients?
Le Schnook: Price can be no object when it comes to dealing with exquisite food like zis. It must be prepared with only the finest ingredients, and eaten with only the finest silverware, while sitting on the finest furniture! [Le Schnook tries to sit in one of the chair, but it is just a billboard] Zis... is not ze chair I ordered...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, well you see those were out of stock.
Le Schnook: And zis fork of plastic... Spray painted to look silver, is it not? [Mr. Krabs starts to sweat, chuckling nervously. Le Schnook gets back up, dusting himself] I cannot prepare food UNDER ZESE CONDITIONS! [cuts back to the Fancy! restaurant where there is a big line and everybody is eating Krabby Patties]
Fancy Head Chief: Monsieur SpongeBob, although it is in direct violation of our chef exchange program rules, let me assure you that these kisses are not merely a formality. They are genuine! [kisses SpongeBob twice] I am sure that this is only the beginning of a long and... [SpongeBob's alarm on his wrist watch rings]
SpongeBob: Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again! [is about to walk out, but the chef stops him]
Fancy Head Chef: I apologize, Monsieur SpongeBob, but you can see that my customers had grown rather fond of your Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab! [starts taking all the Krabby Patties and putting them in a sack and then puts it in his suitcase] So long! [customers gasp and SpongeBob begins to leave and one customer holds on to his leg]
Customer: Wait, just one more?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, but I've got to go. [all customers hold on to his leg. However, he manages to get out. The scene switches to the Krusty Krab and it has a sign that reads “out of business” because it went bankrupt. Inside the restaurant, repo men are seen hauling away the fancy furniture. We then see Mr. Krabs crying in his office]
Mr. Krabs: I'm ruined! Busted! [phone then rings and Mr. Krabs answers it] Hello?
Pearl: [on phone] Daddy, the house is full of burglars. [Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men. [Mr. Krabs hangs up and notices Squidward being held on to by his arms by two other repo men]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me!
Mr. Krabs: Uh, well, you know, until I come up with the money I owe, I'm afraid you'll be staying with these nice gents.
Squidward: You sold me?!?
Mr. Krabs: No! Bartered is more like it. They keep you, I keep my kneecaps.
Repo Man: Come on, mac! [takes him away]
Squidward: You're pathetic! [Le Schnook then walks in]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Mr. Le Schnook... I lost everything! I'm bankrupt! You and your fancy eats are all I got left now.
Le Schnook: Not quite. My time in the chef's exchange program has expired. So my "eats" and I are leaving. [hands Mr. Krabs a bill] This is for you.
Mr. Krabs: Is it money?
Le Schnook: It is the bill for my services. [Mr. Krabs unfolds the bill. His eyes become bloodshot, and he is unable to move]
Repo Man: One side, please. [Repo men take Mr. Krabs’ desk and chair away while he is sitting in it, a repo man brings Mr. Krabs back into the restaurant lobby. He is set down on the floor. Mr. Krabs starts crying]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can still hear his sweet little voice.
SpongeBob: [High pitched] Mr. Kra-a-abs?!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, now I'm scared.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Darn his cursed mocking voice! I... [notices SpongeBob] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy. You came back! And you brought customers!
[The scene cuts to all customers talking at once. We can hear some of them. Customer #1 says: "Oh, please, we must have some Krabby Patties. We just adore...". Customer #2 says: "Please, Krabby Patties...". Customer #3 says: "Krabby Patties, please.". Customer #4 says: "Krabby Patties..."]
Mr. Krabs: [now talking to Squidward] Well, Mr. Squidward, all's well that end's well. I got me poor disgusting old clientèle back, and rich disgusting new clientèle to boot! [Rich woman burps] I'm back in business!
Squidward: Couldn't you at least give them tables to eat on?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no way. See, I've learned that you can't buy customer loyalty with fancy tables, froufrou food, or even sanitary conditions. Hey, get back you, eat your own. [Mr. Krabs throws them a bucket of Krabby Patties, the customers squeal like pigs] Nope, just good food prepared with love. Ain't that right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs. [Blows another kiss, Squidward swallows it and starts choking. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh]


[The episode begins with Patrick watching a cartoon that involves with a sea urchin getting pummeled by a dimwitted snail. The snail bashes the sea urchin with a vase.]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits the sea urchin with a shoe]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits the sea urchin with a refrigerator]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
[Patrick laughs hysterically and carries his television over to SpongeBob's house. Patrick bumps into the front door and gets his face squished. He pulls his face off the screen.]
TV Announcer: Wow! It's the "Sir Urchin and Snail Fail" show!
Patrick: It's cartoon time, SpongeBob! [enters SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? [looks all over the living and goes upstairs] SpongeBob? [he sees SpongeBob exit his library] SpongeRobert?
SpongeBob: Oh! It's cartoon time! I'll get our "Sir Urchin" hats. [gets pulled back by Patrick] Whoa.
Patrick: Not so fast, SpongeBob. What's in the secret room?
SpongeBob: It's not a secret room, Patrick. It's my library.
Patrick: W-what's that word mean?
SpongeBob: A library is a...playground for your mind. [pokes his brain out and pulls it back]
[Patrick daydreams about playing on the playground with his brain.]
Patrick: [laughs and grabs the television] Let's do it! It's library time! [throws the television down the stairs]
Sir Urchin and Snail Fail: Ow! Ow! [crashes off-screen]
Snail Fail: What I do?
[In the library, Gary is reading a "Cooking without Salt" cookbook. Patrick is laughing and kicks some pillows in a goofy fashion. He climbs on the ladder and rides around on it. He bumps into SpongeBob and lands on Gary's chair, scaring him. Gary angrily hisses at Patrick.]
SpongeBob: [straightens himself out] Oh, tender, naïve Patrick, it's not that kind of playground. It's a place to read books! See?
Patrick: Oh, I love books! [laughs and throws books around] Book! Book! [SpongeBob dodges the incoming books] Book!
SpongeBob: [whispers] Gary, I don't think Patrick knows how to use a book properly. [gets hit in the face by a book] Ow! [removes the book and grabs Patrick] Behold the books, Patrick. Each one has a story to tell.
Patrick: Whoa.
SpongeBob: Look out! Those books are cliffhangers, stories for the adventurous.
[Two books are clinging for their lives on the shelf. Patrick panics and rushes to help them.]
Patrick: I'll save you! [climbs on the shelf] Whoa! [falls down and gets crushed underneath]
SpongeBob: [pulls Patrick out and shows a log-shaped book] There are logbooks, [holds up a really large book entitled, "War and Peace"] unabridged books, [shows a pop-up book that displays London's Tower Bridge] and books with bridges.
Patrick: Whoa! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [puts a book close to his ear] Listen to the soothing sounds of the audiobooks. [hears seagulls cawing and ocean waves] I can hear the ocean.
[Patrick grabs a book and hears a toilet flushing.]
Patrick: Me too!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
SpongeBob: Cookbooks, for the culinarily curious.
[Patrick takes a page that has a picture of a turkey on it. He puts it on a stove, fries it up, and eats it.]
Patrick: I like the pictures.
SpongeBob: [reaches in Patrick's mouth and grabs the page] Ah, but the pictures are a mere snack! [closes the book and puts it away] It's the words in the book that really feeds your brain. Let's start you off with an old book. [takes an old book that is covered in cobwebs and dust; he parachutes down and opens the book; and eerie dust bunny appears and SpongeBob sniffs it up] Ah, musty old books smell. Now, read the words, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, read the—oh, uh..."Once...Upon a..." "Once upon a..." Once upon a what?!
SpongeBob: To continue the story, you have to turn the page. [turns a page]
Patrick: Oh. "Time." "Once upon a time!" [laughs and turns pages] That's the most amazing trick I've ever seen! I want to stare at more words!
SpongeBob: Then feast your eyes!
[SpongeBob turns the pages and Patrick goes to read. Inside Patrick's head, his brain is sitting alone on the couch, feeling bored. It picks its nose and smears it on the arm rest. It then sees Patrick looking at the words in the book he's reading.]
Patrick: Once upon a time...
[While Patrick is reading, the words "Once upon a time" fly in through his eye sockets and pile up on his brain.]
Patrick: [continues to read while SpongeBob is turning the pages] Once a— You're too slow! [pushes SpongeBob away and reads through the book]
SpongeBob: He likes it! Hey, Patrick!
[As Patrick continues to read, more words flow into his brain. The brain sniffs at the words and comes up with an idea. It gathers the words together and uses them to build a house. Once it's complete, it reads "Home Sweet Home." It enters its house, but more words pile up as Patrick continuously reads books. As Patrick continues to read, his head begins to swell up.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, Patrick, your head is absorbing all the book knowledge just like a sponge! [laughs]
[Patrick's brain is building more houses out of the words that flow into Patrick's head.]
SpongeBob: [laughs and bangs on books like drums] Go, Patrick! Get those words! Get them good!
[Patrick uses his eyeballs to page through the books in a fast pace and SpongeBob drums really hard. Patrick's brain builds more buildings. Patrick's eyes suck up all the until he starts getting tired.]
Patrick: Stop reading words! [his pupils page through the book as his head swells]
SpongeBob: Wow, what a bookworm! [sees Patrick's swelled up head] Whoa.
Patrick: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, I think that's enough knowledge for one day. Looks like you're full.
Patrick: Nonsense, dear boy. One can never accumulate too much information. [whips his face with a napkin] Ahem.
SpongeBob: Well, we're fresh out of books. Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream.
Patrick: Ah, I must confess to feeling more than slightly peckish.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm so proud of you! Ooh, you're a big brain now!
[Patrick attempts to leave, but his enormous head gets him stuck to the door.]
Patrick: Oh, skosh too big, it seems, eh, wha'?
SpongeBob: "Eh, wha" what?
Patrick: [laughs] Oh, no matter, my plebeian friend. I shall simply exit posthaste, posterior-first. [attempts to exit backwards, but ends up getting stuck]
SpongeBob: I got it. [pushes Patrick]
Patrick: Careful.
SpongeBob: Little bit... [pushes Patrick] Wow. You really got your melon jammed in there, didn't you?
Patrick: Oh, true, SpongeBob. Eh, but we can easily solve this problem on a quantum physics level. Take this down. If we reduce my subatomic particles by way of orbital electromagnetism, we'll create a harmonic oscillation within the molecules, resulting in a wave-function collapse, which will enable my "melon," as you so drolly put it, to slip out.
[As Patrick spoke, simple mathematics appear from his head and swirl around SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Okay, sure. Let's give it a try. [puts various parts together and creates a machine; he stick the suction plugs on to Patrick's head; then he creates sound waves to help shrink Patrick's head, but the waves bounce back and hit Gary, causing him to shrink and multiply into little snails] Gary! Speak to me. Oh... [gathers the little snails and forms Gary back to his normal self] Oh, Gary you're back. I'd know that slime anywhere. [gasps] Slime! That's it! [laughs] Slime it up, Gar-bear.
[Gary slithers slime all over Patrick's head.]
Patrick: Abominable!
SpongeBob: Yeah, that Gary grease ought to do it. Okay, Patrick, pull yourself out.
[Patrick attempts to pull himself out, but with no success. SpongeBob tries to help him, but Patrick's swelled up head sends him flying into one of the bookshelves. SpongeBob sees a book about head-shrinking.]
SpongeBob: Hey. "Head Shrinking for Beginners." [reads book] Hm...
[The fireplace builds up the fire. SpongeBob, dressed as a witchdoctor, screams like a chicken. Gary plays the drums in rhythm. Patrick's head is covered in lite candles. SpongeBob chants and dances around like he's performing a ritual. He opens the bottle, drinks the potion and spits it in Patrick's face. But instead of shrinking Patrick's head, SpongeBob's head shrinks.]
SpongeBob: [high-pitched] Oh, I give up! I'll guess we'll have to live here in the library forever, Gary.
[Gary hides behind the drums in fear. SpongeBob cries a fountain of tears and his head goes back to normal.]
Patrick: SpongeBob, your typically moronic attempt has given me the solution! Perhaps because I had to smarten up to get stuck...
SpongeBob: You'll need to dumb down to get free!
Patrick: [laughs] Who's sporting the big brain now, hm? [laughs]
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick! Let's get stupid! Yeah! [gives Patrick a tongue five]
[SpongeBob puts on gloves and goggles. Patrick kicks a book in SpongeBob's face.]
SpongeBob: Electronics.
[SpongeBob collects various pieces of parts and puts them all together to make television set. Once he's done, he places it in front of Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Whew. I hope this works.
[Patrick sighs and SpongeBob turns on the television where the Sir Urchin and Snail Fail show is airing. Snail Fail hits Sir Urchin with a vase.]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits the sea urchin with a shoe]
Sir Urchin: Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do?
Patrick: I'm sorry, dear boy, but watching this mindless drivel isn't affecting me in the least...[gets dazed and starts to drool]
SpongeBob: We've got drool! Patrick, it's working! [holds up the television]
Snail Fail: What I do?
Patrick: [his eyeballs rub against the screen] This is insulting my intelligence. [begins to laugh] And I adore it! [laughs enthusiastically]
[Inside Patrick's head, Patrick's brain hears a loud noise. He turns and sees Sir Urchin and Snail Fail destroying everything it built.]
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits Sir Urchin with a word]
Sir Urchin: [throws a chunk] Why you...!
Snail Fail: What I do? [hits Sir Urchin with a word]
[Patrick's brain runs to hide somewhere as Sir Urchin and Snail Fail destroy everything. Patrick's head shrinks down to its normal size.]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! The mindless drivel is destroying your knowledge!
[SpongeBob plugs a hose in Patrick's head and sprays the words back into the books. He sprays the words onto the shelves and form brand new books for his library. The hose spits out the last remaining words and Patrick's brain.]
SpongeBob: Whoops. Here, Patrick. You may need this little fella. [puts his brain back into Patrick's head]
Patrick: Huh? Ah.
[Patrick's brain falls onto the couch in his head. It becomes bored again and picks its nose.]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, this is where we came in. Ready for some ice cream?
Patrick: Boy, am I ever! [sees a book on the floor] A book? I love books! [goes back to throwing books] A book! [throws books] A book!
SpongeBob: [dodges the incoming books] That's right, Patrick. [dodges a book] Play nice with the pretty squares. Gary, this is really one for the books, eh? [laughs]
[Gary meows dully in response. SpongeBob laughs, but gets a book thrown in his mouth. He turns to the screen and laughs as he shows the cover of the book entitled, "The End."]

Mr. Krabs: What a no-good eel-in-the-kelp that guy was! [Stands on barrel.] There ain't nothing worse than a thief! Thieves need to be locked up forever! They should all be strung up by their gills and forced to breathe air!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, what about all the stuff you stole?
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
SpongeBob:  [points to the barrel Mr. Krabs is standing on] Like that barrel. [The scene then shows a close up of the barrel.] It says, "Property of Salty Sea Farms".
[Mr. Krabs jumps off the barrel.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's where I rent me pickles from.
SpongeBob: Are you renting the barrel, too?
Mr. Krabs: Well, no.
SpongeBob: Then you bought it?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: Then, isn't that stealing?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I, uh...
Patrick: [While holding up a towel.] What about this towel from the Sizzling Spring Sauna?
Mr. Krabs: Um... Well..
SpongeBob: [While waving a phone back and forth] And this Bikini Bell phone.

Mr. Krabs: Well, he...
SpongeBob: [While holding up hair curlers] Even Mrs. Puff's hair curlers.
Mr. Krabs: [While grabbing the hair curlers] That one was a gift! [He stops sweating.] Listen, all that stuff is, uh... borrowed.
SpongeBob: Borrowed? Well, that's a relief. I thought you took it without [While shaking his head] permission.
Mr. Krabs: [While waving his claw down] Ah, permission shmermission! You can borrow anything you want, anytime, as long as if you give it back [puts arms to side] before it's missed. [While shrugging] Everyone knows that! Right?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [raise fists in air] Okay!
Mr. Krabs: All right then! [While hugging them] Hugs? [Mr. Krabs walks behind SpongeBob and Patrick.] You put in [While pushing the two out of the frame.] a hard day's work, boys!
[The scene changes to show a wide shot of the exterior of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out the door.]

Patrick: Hi-yo-hoo!
SpongeBob: We have to confess.

He happily goes back to cleaning and eats the remainder of the stuff. After filling himself with stuff, he shoots everything into several boxes and then puts those boxes inside a small box.]
SpongeBob: [sighs in relief] That takes care of that. [leans to the side of the stairs, only to slip due to them being covered with dust. He rubs his finger on the dust, and it coughs on him] Yuck. This place needs a good scrub.
[Scene changes to SpongeBob with some cleaning supplies. He pours the water in the bucket on himself and absorbs it. He then puts his head on the floor and starts cleaning it. After cleaning the floor, he cleans the stairs in a short amount of time. He is now at the top of the stairs.]
SpongeBob: Ah, almost done. I just need to shine out that old lighthouse's lantern. [He hears some weird sounds, and gets terrified by them] The lighthouse is haunted! Just like my toaster.
[A toaster is seen swinging around SpongeBob's kitchen while making scary noises. The toast comes out of the toaster, in the shape of a ghost.]
SpongeBob: [opens the door, only for there to be nothing inside. After making a sigh of relief, a box falls down and starts moving, scaring him] That box is haunted! [He falls down the stairs and gets hurt several times as he's going down] These stairs are haunted! [SpongeBob lands on the small box, causing all the big boxes as well as all the stuff packed in them to spill all over the lighthouse again] This trash is haunted. [the box creeps towards him, and he panics while backing away]
Louie: [comes out of the box] Meow.
SpongeBob: [still scared] Ahh! Ghost snail! [he cowers and cries a little]
Louie: [goes next to SpongeBob and soothes him] Meow.
SpongeBob: [becomes happy] Oh, you're no ghost. Just a cute little stray snail. How about I call you Louie? Lighthouse Louie! [giggles]
Louie: [accepting his name to be Louie] Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: [as he's putting down Louie] Now, Louie, you'll be good while uncle SpongeBob cleans. [attempts to pick up a box]
Louie: [goes to SpongeBob] Meow, meow. [SpongeBob trips on him. After he lands on the floor, he goes over him, while covering him with slime] Meow.
SpongeBob: [gets up and takes Louie outside the lighthouse] Louie, I'm afraid you'll have to play out here, little fella. For your own safety. [goes back inside and shuts the door, while sighing in relief. Several objects get thrown from inside the box, the thrower being Louie] What! Louie? [scene changes to him tying Louie onto the boat so he won't bother him] Well, that oughta keep you out of my HAIR!
Louie: [seen in the lighthouse, having already escaped] Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Louie, you have to stay outside. [attempts to throw Louie outside, but ends up getting thrown outside himself, with the part of the car Louie was tied to being thrown onto him as well] No silly little snail is a match for my superior sponge brain! [shows his brain, doing a small dance until the wind ends up knocking it down from its position] [scene changes to him bringing out a Krabby Patty in a Can, while giggling. He opens the can with his teeth and puts it on a plate] And the bait: one can-o-patty. [SpongeBob ties a rope onto a stick holding a box above the can-o-patty, and hides behind the stuff.]
Louie: [notices the Krabby Patty] Meow! [goes under the box and licks it several times]
SpongeBob: [pulls the string] Gotcha! [the box goes down and traps Louie. He opens the box, but the snail is gone] I don't gotcha. [realizes Louie put a bigger box on top of the small box. The snail pulls the string for the larger box, causing him to get trapped] You got me. [pulls up his nose to turn on his light, and tries to get out of the box, only to break his arms] Barnacles, that's heavy. Huh? [sees the Krabby Patty in a Can is still inside and uses his feet to grab it. He eats the small portion of it that was left, allowing him to become extremely strong, enough to get outside the box with ease. He realizes Louie isn't there] Huh, where'd Louie go? [his arms let out air and become weak again. He is now at the top of the lighthouse, calling out for Louie] Louie! Louie! Louie!
Louie: [on top of lantern] Meow.
SpongeBob: [relieved to finally see Louie] Louie! So this is where you've been hiding? [Louie shrieks at him, making him gulp and become scared] Nice snail, good Louie! [backs up] No, no... [screams]
[Louie jumps on him, and they go all over the top of the lighthouse. They hit the wall, and when they come off, SpongeBob accidentally flicks the button to turn on the lighthouse's lantern. It shines on a place called Protein Fiend, where it reflects SpongeBob and Louie fighting on one of its walls.]
Larry: [amazed by the reflection] Woah, those dudes are huge! I wonder what they lift. [hits Bubble Bass slightly with his elbow]
Bubble Bass: [notices the reflection and drops his drink in fear] Those aren't dudes. They're giant monsters! Everybody panic! [the three start panicking and run around in circles]
[Louie is biting SpongeBob, and their ruckus causes the lighthouse to start rocking. At the same time, Mrs. Puff is still listening and rocking to the rock music, unaware of what's going on outside. The lighthouse tips over and rolls out of the boating school. Larry, Bubble Bass, and the small fish are still panicking until they see that the reflection is gone.]
Larry: [happy] Those buff monsters have vanished! [hugs the other two] We're saved! [he and the other two hear some noise, and realize the lighthouse is coming their way]
Bubble Bass: We're doomed! [he gets out his drink and starts walking across the sidewalk away from the lighthouse, while the other two runoff in a different direction. The lighthouse runs over him, causing him to get submerged into the sidewalk with his posterior sticking out] My cheeks!
[Bikini Bottom News plays, showing Perch Perkins having an interview with Fred about the lighthouse.]
Perch Perkins: Can you please tell our viewers the cause of this destruction?
Fred: [frightened] It was a lighthouse. It rolled through town, destroying everything in its path! [pants] A LIGHTHOUSE! [goes on his knees and starts crying]
Perchy Perkins: [shocked] My goodness. Were you or YOUR LEGS injured by this insane lighthouse?
Fred: [sad and kicks a rock] No.
[The lighthouse is now rolling towards the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [shrieks as he watches the lighthouse on TV rolling towards his restaurant] That blasted lighthouse is gonna demolish me Krusty Krab! [speaks to his customers] Attention loyal customers!
Paco: Run for our lives?
Mr. Krabs: No, throw your bodies in front of that lighthouse, and protect me restaurant! [some rumbling occurs]
[All the customers run out of the Krusty Krab, while Louie is still attempting to bite SpongeBob as they're on the lighthouse.]
SpongeBob: [realizes they're heading for the Krusty Krab] No, not the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the restaurant, brave] Stay away from me restaurant, you dirty... er... lighthouse! [the lighthouse continues rolling his way. He hides in his shell, now scared]
SpongeBob: [having trouble speaking] Must... stop... lighthouse. [jumps and turns around, causing his shoes to burn when he lands and the lighthouse to stop before it crashes into the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his shell] Ha-ha, and don't come back! [laughs some more as the lighthouse is moving away]
[Louie smashes onto SpongeBob, causing the lighthouse to turn back around and crash into the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs is going inside it.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the rubble, severely damaged] Oh, you came back. [his arms and eyes fall out of his body]
[The lighthouse rolls towards the boating school and hits a rock causing it to fly into the air. It lands on a boat, which drives onto the original placement of the lighthouse before the boat gets destroyed by it. At the same time, Mrs. Puff continues to listen to her rock music, still unaware of what's going on in her surroundings. All the boxes of stuff land on the floor in towers, all organized. Meanwhile, a scared SpongeBob is on the lighthouse's lantern, and gets off of it to search for Louie.]
SpongeBob: [worried] Louie? Where's Louie? [he hears some meowing, and when he opens the lantern's door, he realizes Louie gave birth to several baby snails] Aw, Louie, you weren't trying to stop me from cleaning! [pats one of the baby snails] You were just protecting your cute little babies. [the baby snails meow in unison] I guess I should call you Louise instead! [laughs]
[SpongeBob brings Mrs. Puff inside the lighthouse.]
Mrs. Puff: [shocked and amazed] You actually did a good job, SpongeBob! You deserve a gold star! [puts a star on his forehead]
SpongeBob: [excited] Ohh, a gold star! I have a present for you, too, Mrs. Puff. [gives her a box with Louie and her baby snails] These little cuties were hiding in your lighthouse.
Mrs. Puff: [in awe, chuckles] Aren't you adorable?
SpongeBob: [blushes] Oh, Mrs. Puff, you're pretty cute, too!
[Mrs. Puff frowns at this statement. The two go outside the lighthouse towards the entrance at the school, where SpongeBob leaves the school.]
SpongeBob: [happy] See you next week, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: [relieved] Amazing. For once, SpongeBob didn't create a huge disaster! [hears the angry mob]
Mr. Krabs: [angry along with the others in the mob] Puff! Your blasted lighthouse destroyed the whole town! [becomes sad] And me restaurant!
Mrs. Puff: [shocked] My lighthouse?!
The entire mob: What are you going to do about it?!
Mrs. Puff: [puts on her headphones, turns on her radio, and starts rocking again] Talk to the fin! [The snails come out of the box, and rock with her as well.]


Squidward: [At register] Ah, yes, just how I like it... nice and empty. [looks around at the empty restaurant]
Old Man Walker: [Sitting at a table] Hey, I'm still here. [Waves]
Squidward: Oh, yes, sirree—nice and empty. [Looks around then sits down at the register. Presses a button revealing a slot with a pillow. Pulls down a picture of an island and turns on a fan. Drinks a drink and is relaxed]
Jimmy: Do you work here? [looking over register]
Squidward: [Spits his drink. Sighs] Welcome to the Krusty-- Wha-What the! [Sees the large line of people and gasps] Well, there goes my nap. Multiple orders up! Sponge... Bob! SpongeBob! Where are you?! You need to get out here and make those Krabby Patties. [Looking for SpongeBob in the kitchen. SpongeBob starts laughing from inside a barrel. Squidward looks through the barrel hole. SpongeBob is writing in a book. Squidward grumbles and sticks a megaphone into the hole] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes out of the megaphone like liquid] Get it together, SpongeBob. The dining room is full of ravenous customers. [Customers making monkey noises, chewing on things, and swinging from ropes]
SpongeBob: [In liquid form, goes to the storage freezer and comes back out with a stack of patties] I got it. [Spins like a tornado throwing the patties onto the grill. Presses button on spatula twice that makes it fold out to have triple length. Flips three patties and whistles]
Squidward: Hmm, what was that imbecile doing in there? [Looking at the barrel. Pulls out book] An old book?
SpongeBob: [Looks back scared] Nothing.
[Takes book from Squidward and places it between the fryers]
Squidward: What's going on here?
[SpongeBob gets all the patties into a stack and puts ingredients inside of himself. Jumps out to the dining area where he jumps onto the ceiling and shoots out Krabby Patties to the customers]
Customers: Thank you! [Waving at SpongeBob. They take bites and give thumbs up to each other. SpongeBob continues to shoot out Krabby Patties. Customers clap once again]
Old Man Walker: Excuse me. I wanted pickles on mine. [SpongeBob taps his head twice, shooting pickles onto Krabby Patty]
[Squidward looks out from the kitchen to the main area of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Hmmm. [Picks up book from between the fryers] If SpongeBrain is keeping the book away from me, then I have no choice but to read it. [SpongeBob walks into kitchen]
SpongeBob: I'll take that, thank you. [Takes book]
[SpongeBob is sitting on top of a barrel writing in the diary]
Squidward: [Looking through the kitchen window with his nose hanging over] There he goes again, scribbling away in that little book. [Turns back around] I must admit, my curiosity is peaked... I guess I'm "peaked" to "peek" at that book. [Laughs as a rimshot is heard. Sighs] Oh, puns. [Wipes away tears from laughing]
Old Man Walker: [Sitting at a table] Ha.
Squidward: [Holding brown bag] Hey, SpongeBob, you need to make a delivery.
SpongeBob: [Closes diary, sets it down, and turns towards Squidward] Okie-dokie!
Squidward: The address is on the bag.
SpongeBob: I got it. [Walks out of kitchen]
Squidward: [Whistles and walks to the diary. Picks up the diary and gasps] It's a diary! Oh-ho-ho. This is gonna be good. Huh? Drat, it's locked. [Tries to pry lock open] Hmm. I need a hairpin. [Mr. Krabs is in his office writing on paper. Squidward reaches behind him and pulls out a hairpin. Mr. Krabs' hair puffs out into an afro. Squidward unlocks the lock with the pin, opens the diary, watching it glow and a heavenly choir singing] And now... the diary of a moron. [Reading diary]
SpongeBob: "Dear diary, what an amazing day I've..." [Fades into SpongeBob narrating he story] ...day I've had. [Phone ringing] This morning I was greeted by my nearest and dearest neighbor, Squidward. [Answers phone] He had some very important news he was just bursting to share. [Phone growls at SpongeBob. Walks to Squidward's house] He had decided that today would be the perfect day to deliver his profound opinions on how to properly raise and care for a household pet. [Knocks on the door. Squidward answers and holds Gary angrily. Gary is chewing. Squidward shoves Gary to SpongeBob] Specifically, what not to feed them. [Squidward holds up a record album that reads "Sole Jazz" and throws it at SpongeBob] The list was very thorough. [Squidward holds up a torn shirt on hanger, then a picture of his mother with a bite taken out of it] Needless to say, this is all very enlightening. [Squidward throws picture on ground and jumps on it] It warms my heart to know that Squidward thinks we're close enough to use the harshest words in his critique-- [Squidward yelling in SpongeBob's face] Horrible words that should never be used around strangers, who may now know how well-intentioned those words are. [Squidward points and pokes SpongeBob angrily] Knowing I have a tendency to dawdle, Gary cut our conversation short. [Gary bites Squidward's hand. Squidward punts SpongeBob] And I was hurried along to work, where I arrived only a hour and a half early for what may be my favorite day of the year, [SpongeBob lands at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs unlocks the front door] cleaning day! [SpongeBob mopping, Mr. Krabs reading the paper] Together, Mr. Krabs and I scrubbed every inch of the Krusty Krab, [SpongeBob scrubbing floor] and finally, with a little elbow grease, we were able to get into even the tightest spots. [Mr. Krabs using SpongeBob as chimney sweep] Ah yes, cleaning day. [Narration ends]
Squidward: Great Neptune, I had no idea. The depth of his delusion is awe inspiring.
SpongeBob: [Knocks on door] Well, I don't know. Something about this delivery address doesn't seem right. [SpongeBob is at a dumpster. Gasps] Wait a minute. Squidward! He must have been the victim of a prank phone call. Poor Squidward. He can be so gullible. [SpongeBob sets the delivery in the dumpster]
Patrick: [Comes up from inside the dumpster] Oh, boy! [Looks in bag] A ketchup packet! That'll go great on this old diaper. [Holds up ketchup and diaper]
SpongeBob: [Back at the Krusty Krab. Chuckles] Oh, Squidward! You are gonna laugh when you hear what I've... been. [Squidward crouches down to hide] Squidward? Where are you? Could have sworn I just saw him.
Squidward: [nervously sweating] SpongeBob, uh, one of the customers dropped his watch in a toilet, and I need you to fish it out. [Holds up plunger and hanger]
SpongeBob: [Takes hanger and plunger] Duty calls.
[Squidward takes diary out from inside his hat. Opens it, turns the page, and laughs. His laugh turns into a cough as he sees a large customer at the register]
Customer #2: You laughing at me?
Squidward: What? Oh, no. No, no, no. I was just reading what SpongeBob wrote in his diary. It's hilarious.
Customer #2: Reading somebody else's diary—that's terrible! Tell me more!
Squidward: It says here, when SpongeBob sees plaid, he has the uncontrollable urge to cluck like a chicken. [Both laugh]
Mr. Krabs: [Now at the register] Did somebody say plaid? Why I'm a plaid enthusiast. [Wearing kilt] I just got me new kilt today.
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob. Can you come here, please?
SpongeBob: [Walks out of the restroom with  a tire, umbrella, guitar, anchor, and Old Man Walker] I couldn't find that watch anywhere. All I found was this stuff--
Old Man Walker: I fell in.
SpongeBob: And that guy.
Squidward: What do you think of Mr. Krabs' new plaid kilt?
SpongeBob: P-p-p-p-plaid? [SpongeBob's face doubles with 2 mouths. He throws everything out of his hands]
Old Man Walker: Hey! [SpongeBob starts clucking like a chicken and crows like a rooster]
Mr. Krabs: Well, you don't have to be nasty about it!
[Squidward and Customer #2 laugh. SpongeBob is still clucking]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob slaps himself] Avert your eyes, SquarePants. [Covers eyes] I have to take my break! [Runs through the kitchen out the back. Pulls out bubble soap and blows bubbles. Sighs]
Squidward: [Reading to customers] Listen to this — SpongeBob has named his spatula "Fifi."
[Customers all laugh]
Henry-Bart: He named his spatula "Fifi."
Nat: He named his spatula "Fifi." [Telling customers behind him. Customers laugh] What kind of name is Fifi?
Patrick: [Laughing loudly] Who ever heard of naming a spatula Fifi? It's a girl's name! Right, Frank? [Holds up his own spatula]
SpongeBob: [Walks out of the kitchen holding spatula] I'm back from my break. Any orders, Squidward?
Patrick: Yeah, cook me up a Krabby Patty... with good old Fifi.
SpongeBob: [Gasps] Oh, sure thing. [Runs to kitchen] Fifi, how did Patrick know your name? Have you been talking?
Squidward: Oh, oh, this is the best one yet. Get this: "If I hear the Bikini Bottom Municipal Anthem, I can't help but take off all my clothes and dance around in my underwear!" [Everyone laughs] Quiet, quiet, quiet. Watch this. [Pulls out radio and plays the anthem] [SpongeBob calmly throws spatula and takes off clothes wearing only his underwear. He dances around. Everyone laughs and the music stops. SpongeBob looks over at Squidward]
SpongeBob: My... Diary! Squidward! How could you?! [Cries and runs into the dining area with everyone laughing at him. Runs into Mr. Krabs, clucks like a chicken again, continues crying, and runs out the door]
Nat: That was that little dude's diary? [Door slams]
Customers: [Overlapping murmuring] That is not okay. That was uncool.
Mr. Krabs: That's low, Squidward... even for you. You'd better apologize.
Squidward: [Scoffs] He'll get over it.
[SpongeBob is crying outside of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is scatting and humming. He pulls out an umbrella as he walks by SpongeBob crying]
Newspaper Boy: Extra, extra, read all about it! Jerk reads the diary, local fry cook devastated. [Holding up newspaper]
Squidward: Oh, boy, let me see one of those papers. Uh-huh, mm-hm. [Cover of paper shows a sad photo of SpongeBob. Squidward laughs and tosses the paper on the ground. Citizens stare at him] Taxi! [Waving, a taxi car with the model of the boat screeches its tires, approaching him]
Driver: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it, pal. You're that diary reader.
Squidward: Yes, I am. [Driving away in an angry attitude after hearing tires squeal, Squidward coughs in the exhaust. Then he continues walking]
Abigail-Marge: Diary thief!
Sandals: Jerk!
John: Secret stealer!
Sadie: Billy, stay away from that mean, old diary reader.
Squidward: Morons. [At his front door]
Quincy: Squidward Tentacles, by reading another person's diary, you have violated the terms of your loan. [Holds up loan papers] We are repossessing your house.
Squidward: [coughs] What?
Quincy: Take it away, boys! [Squidward’s house is lifted away with a crane. Thunder crashes and it starts to rain. Squidward puts up his umbrella and gets hit by lightning]
Squidward: Ow! [Squidward now laying on a bench with newspapers over his body. The papers blow away]
Officer Nancy: [Taps Squidward on the head with a club with her partner, Officer John] Hey, you can't sleep here, fella. [Horn honks] Wait a second, you're that diary reader! I had a diary once. My brother read it! I had a brother once! Come on, fella! We have a special place for people like you!
[Squidward is locked in a pillory]
Patrick: Diary reader! [He throws a tomato at Squidward]
Squidward: What!? You read it, too!
Patrick: Oh, sure, blame everyone but yourself. Oh, that is so you. [Throws tomato at Squidward and walks away. Squidward grunts]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. How's it going?
Squidward: SpongeBob, oh, thank goodness. You have to forgive me.
SpongeBob: What for?
Squidward: For reading your diary.
SpongeBob: Oh, that. You know, Squidward, everyone was so amused by it, I had it published. It's a best seller, and I owe it all to you. [Holds up book titled "SpongeBob's Diary"] Besides, you only read my work diary. You've never even seen my secret personal diary. [Holds up a diary titled "My Secret Personal Diary" with a unicorn, smiley face, heart, and rainbow on the cover] Now, that would have been really embarrassing.
Nat: There he is! That diary reader! [Group of fish holding tomatoes show up] Let's get him!
Crowd: Yeah! [Shouting angrily at Squidward]
SpongeBob: People, people. Stop your assault. Through my art, as an author, I have forgiven Squidward.
Nat: Oh yeah, did you know he's reading your personal diary? [Squidward laughs while holding reading the diary]
SpongeBob: Squidward! How could you?!
[SpongeBob bursts into tears, then runs away once again. After SpongeBob runs away, the crowd throws tomatoes at Squidward yelling at him]
Squidward: I don't care. This is so worth it! [Squidward laughs]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. A customer is giving a creepy smile at Squidward.]
Squidward: Hmm.
[The customer makes an even more creepier smile.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Where are those patties?
SpongeBob: Coming right...down, Squidward. [laughs]
Squidward: What are you talking about, SpongeBob? Don't you mean coming right up?
SpongeBob: Mmm...[points to the ceiling]
Squidward: I don't see what you're— [looks up and sees a patty stuck to the ceiling]
[The patty falls down from the ceiling and lands onto Squidward's eyes, burning them and he screams.]
SpongeBob: Nice catch, Squidward! [scoops the patty of Squidward's eyes and makes it into a Krabby Patty]
Squidward: Thanks...
[Suddenly, SpongeBob hears a little boy crying in the dining room. He goes out of the kitchen and hands the customer a patty.]
Customer: Whoo! [chortling and gibbering]
Little Boy: I want my teddy fish! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha, all right, don't worry, little boy, we'll find it! [to SpongeBob] This kid lost his toy. SpongeBob, I need you to check the Lost and Found.
SpongeBob: Ooh! I didn't know we had a Lost and Found.
Little Boy: I love my teddy fish! [sobbing]
[An angry customer gets up and leaves with her sandwich.]
Mr. Krabs: You better find it quick, SpongeBob. The kid's bawlin' is chasing me customers away. Follow me, boy-o!
Little Boy: [bawling continues]
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs go into the kitchen. Mr. Krabs opens the door to the Lost and Found and dust flies out, making SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs cough.]
SpongeBob: Is there a ladder?
Mr. Krabs: Yes. [leaves]
[SpongeBob steps into the Lost and Found and falls into it.]
Mr. Krabs: Here's the ladder, boy-o! [throws the ladder down to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay, I— [gets hit by the ladder]
Mr. Krabs: Nice catch!
[SpongeBob struggles to get up but falls over the ladder.]
SpongeBob: Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Now, try not to get a bit of anything poisonous!
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nothing, nothing. Good luck!
[SpongeBob sees a box and starts to dig around in it.]
SpongeBob: Oh, this must be the Lost and Found! [looks through the box] It's not in here!
Mr. Krabs: Try turning on the lights!
[SpongeBob turns on the lights and sees a huge collection of lost stuff in the Lost and Found.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Wow! Lost umbrellas! Lost flip flops! Lost keys! Lost remotes! Oh! A whole, entire shelf of lost "cool guy" shades! Now, that's a sight for more eyes. [laughs as dozens of eyes appear in his holes]
[SpongeBob takes a pair of shades and puts them on.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no pictures, please. Did you get my good side? [laughs]
[A giggle echoes in the background.]
SpongeBob: What a funny echo. Ha...ha.
[Another giggle echoes in the background.]
SpongeBob: [gulps] Hey! [laughs] There's bric-a-brac and gee-gaws! [gasps] I wonder if there's tchotchkes! Oh! Oh! Tchotchkes! Lost novelty items! Wow! [his eye widens and covers his entire face] I love lost novelty items! [takes out false teeth] Ooh!
[The teeth chatters in his arms and shakes SpongeBob, making him step on the whoopee cushions on the floor.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me! Oh!
[The chattering teeth make SpongeBob bounce up and down until he grabs a rubber chicken.]
SpongeBob: Ah!
[SpongeBob performs a Latin dance with the rubber chicken while stepping on the whoopee cushions. He throws the rubber chicken away.]
SpongeBob: [screams and hides in his pants as a real chicken flies over him]
[SpongeBob finishes his Latin dance and cymbal-clapping sea monkeys clap their cymbals.]
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, cymbal-clapping sea chimps! [notices a snow globe] What is this? Looks like Bikini Bottom.
[SpongeBob shakes the snow globe. Suddenly, the entire place rumbles and the people in Bikini Bottom scream as if they are having an earthquake. The shaking stops and SpongeBob nervously puts the snow globe down.]
SpongeBob: Whew! [gets hit by a falling box] Whoa!
[Another giggle echoes in the background. Meanwhile, upstairs in the kitchen, Mr. Krabs waits just as Squidward walks in.]
Squidward: Hey, Mr. Krabs, you know that crying kids?
[The little boy continues his crying.]
Squidward: He's still crying...and it's still annoying!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, I'm glad you're here. I think SpongeBob may be lost in the Lost and Found.
Squidward: And this concerns me how, exactly? [gets grabbed by Mr. Krabs] Wait—what?! [screams as he is thrown into the Lost and Found]
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry. There's a ladder.
[The little boy's constant crying begins to drive all of the customers crazy.]
Mr. Krabs: And find that toy...pronto!
[Meanwhile in the Lost and Found, SpongeBob wakes up and sees four elderly kids hovering over him.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Are you the people of the too-small clothes?
Ginger: No. We were the children, lost in the Krusty Krab over 60 years ago, and we were never claimed.
SpongeBob: Did you drop a box on my head?
Ginger: Of course! It's how we say hello.
SpongeBob: Oh! [throws a box on one of the older kids] Hello!
Old Kid #1: [weakly] Hello. [moans as he drags away]
SpongeBob: Oh, no...looks like I'm lost now too.
Ginger: Don't worry. You are found and can live with us now.
SpongeBob: How did you survive down here all this time?
Ginger: People leave all kinds of things behind. Like gum. And mints. They leave lots of mints. [eats a mint and belches out a horrible breath, which makes SpongeBob dizzy]
SpongeBob: Your breath is delightfully fresh.
Ginger: [claps twice] Bring on the welcoming feast!
[The three older kids runs away and come back with a table filled with stuff made out of candy.]
Old Kids: Welcoming feast!
[The candies are shaped like a turkey, a suckling pig, a bottle of wine, and a  cornucopia with fruit.]
Ginger: Dig in!
[The older kids eat the candied-shaped food. Some of them blew bubbles with the bubble gum while others stuff candy in each others mouth. Ginger goes to give candy to a teddy bear with fins on each side.]
Ginger: Hey, little dolly. You must be getting hungry! [she squeaks the toy]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey! That's the teddy fish! My boss, Mr. Krabs, told me to grab that. Thank you!
Ginger: Grr! This? I found it, so...finders keepers.
Old Kids: Finders keepers. Finders keepers.
[SpongeBob taps Ginger's shoulder.]
Ginger: Huh?
SpongeBob: [grabs the toy] Yoink! Losers weepers! [runs away]
Old Kid #2: He is using our sacred words against us!
Ginger: That's my teddy fish! Get him!
[The four older kids chase after SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Sorry, but this has to go back to its rightful owner!
[SpongeBob continues to run. The four older kids try to catch up, but because they are old, they walk slowly gasping and wheezing.]
Old Kid #2: Run...like the wind...
[Meanwhile, Squidward is going around the Lost and Found, looking for SpongeBob.]
Squidward: Moron! I mean, SpongeBoooob?! I can't believe Old Man Krabs has held on to all this stuff. [notices a box of kazoos] Oooh! Kazoos! Why, I had a kazoo when I was a child...
[A flashback of a younger Squidward is shown.]
Squidward: Everybody loved it!
[Little Squidward blows threw the kazoo, making music that is off-key. All of the children run out of the school, screaming.]
School Kid: Oh! Ow! My ears! [sobbing]
[The flashback ends. Squidward looks through a box and sees clarinets in it.]
Squidward: These are clarinets! In fact, these are all my clarinets! Wait a minute—these weren't lost! They were all in my locker! Mmm.. [hears SpongeBob's panting] Now what could that possibly—[gets run over by SpongeBob]
[In slow motion, SpongeBob steps onto Squidward's old clarinets and breaks them as his runs.]
Squidward: [groans and sees the broken clarinets] Typical.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs looking through the Lost and Found door.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward? SpongeBob? It's the curse of the Lost and Found: no one ever gets found. They just stay lost. [closes the door] Oh, well, back to work.
Little Boy: Waaah!
Customer: The ambiance in this place stinks! [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Stinky ambiance? Oooh, it's a dark time for the Krusty Krab.
Little Boy: Waaaah!
Mr. Krabs: Waaaaah!
[SpongeBob continues to run away from the older kids.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Lost toys! [almost gets hit by a toy arrow and screams, then he pants as he jumps on a scooter]
[The older kids ride on tricycles and skateboards as they chase SpongeBob.]
Ginger: Get him!
[One of the older kids rides on a pogo stick, but falls over. Another older kids rides up to SpongeBob and throws jacks and balls on the floor, making SpongeBob fall over.]
SpongeBob: Lost Toilets? [hops on a toilet and rides off]
[The older kids ride on toilets as they chase SpongeBob.]
Ginger: We need more speed!
[The older kids flush the toilets to go faster. SpongeBob manages to slow them down by getting them tangled with toile paper, causing them to crash into each other.]
SpongeBob: Lost Pets! [gasps and whimpers]
[SpongeBob continues to run as the older kids chase him on snails.]
Older Kid #2: Hyah! Hyah! Mush! Mush!
[SpongeBob and the older kids ride through a mine as miners dig up jewelry.]
SpongeBob: Lost Mine!
[The older kids throw diamonds at SpongeBob, but he deflects them back with his spongy body. Then, SpongeBob is seen riding on a Tylosaurus  in the prehistoric lost world.]
SpongeBob: Lost world!
[The older kids ride on the back of a Tanystropheus as they chase SpongeBob. The scene changes to Squidward continuing to look for SpongeBob. However, he looks up and sees a hatch on the ceiling.]
Squidward: A hatch! Maybe that's the emergency exit! [opens it and grease rains down on him] Grease trap!?
[Squidward gets caught in the torrent of grease and screams helplessly. SpongeBob is still being chased by the older kids until he reaches a dead end.]
SpongeBob: Lost dead ends?! [mutters and whimpers]
[The older kids corner SpongeBob.]
Ginger: Give us the teddy fish!
Old Kids: Teddy fish! Teddy fish!
SpongeBob: No! This teddy fish belongs to a poor, sweet child! [notices grease on the floor] Huh? [licks the grease] Patty grease? Oh, no! I haven't cleaned the grease trap in years!
Old Kids: Oh, no.
Ginger: Quick! Get on each other's shoulders.
[The older kids make a ladder as they climb on their shoulders.]
Ginger: [climbs on them] At least some of us will survive.
Old Kid #1: Aw, come on!
SpongeBob: Wait! I have a better idea! [whistles]
[Upstairs, Mr. Krabs and the little boy continue to wail.]
Mr. Krabs: No SpongeBob, no teddy fish, no customers! [sobbing] All is lost!
[A knock is heard on the door.]
Mr. Krabs: [sniffles] Who is it?
SpongeBob: Tylo!
Mr. Krabs: Tylo who? [gasps as SpongeBob opens the door with a Tylosaurus]
SpongeBob: Tylosaurus!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Thank Neptune you're back, son!
SpongeBob: Oh, good to be back Mr. Krabs, but I'm not the only one. Look who I found!
[Ginger comes up the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Ack! [hits Ginger with SpongeBob] Get back! Get back!
Ginger's mother: Ginger? Is that you?
Ginger: Mom? What are you doing here?
Ginger's mother: We come here every week.
Ginger: "We?"
Ginger's mother: Yes. Myself and your father and the other parents of kids who were lost here. Where were you?
Ginger: In the Lost and Found!
Ginger's mother: [stutter] There's a Lost and Found?
Mr. Krabs: Hm. Maybe I should put up a sign.
[Ginger and the older kids hug their older parents as they are happily reunited.]
SpongeBob: Aww, all the old people are hugging.
[Mr. Krabs pats SpongeBob for doing a good job of reuniting the families.]
SpongeBob: Dry your tears, little kid. Look! It's teddy fish! [gives the kid his toy]
Little Boy: I don't want that anymore!
[The little boy throws the teddy fish. Ginger catches the toy.]
Ginger: Huh? [hugs the toy] Hmm.
Little Boy: I want this! [rides on the Tylosaurus] Whaaa-hoo!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I guess we all learned a lesson about being lost and being found today.
SpongeBob: What's that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know.
SpongeBob: Hey, speaking of lost, where's Squidward?
[Squidward, who is still in the Lost and Found, screams as he is being swept away in a river of the lost world. He blows the kazoo and continues to scream and even bawl uncontrollably as the Tylosaurus and Tanystropheus swim and stomp over him respectively.]


[We see Squidward's house at sunrise. The sun comes up. A scallop crows like a rooster]
Squidward: [singing his vintage, "la-da-dee, la-da-do, la-da-dum] 20 minutes in the bath seems like enough. [has wrinkly hands] [sighs in excitement] Another day! [groans] Another day.
SpongeBob: [falls down the stairs like in "Missing Identity"] Ready for work! [walks to Squidward] Good morning, Squidward, I'm... [spots he's still wearing his underwear] [gasps] Not ready for work! [falls up the stairs]
Squidward: Whatever.
SpongeBob: [runs up to Squidward] Thanks for waiting, Squidward.
Squidward: I wasn't waiting.
SpongeBob: [laughs] I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants.
Squidward: Yes, I saw that.
SpongeBob: I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?
Squidward: Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!
SpongeBob: I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut! [Squidward stops moving] [SpongeBob gasps] Squidward, what are you doing?! [SpongeBob tries to get Squidward to move, and falls onto the ground trying to do so]
Squidward: SpongeBob, look. [pointing to the Krusty Krab] We're walking in a straight line.
SpongeBob: I don't follow.
Squidward: A straight line is the shortest distance between any two points!
SpongeBob: Speak English, brainiac! [laughs]
Squidward: Well, see, you have point A [draws a red A in the sky], where you start, and then there's point... [Squidward draws curved lines in the sky] point...[erasing everything he wrote] I don't even know what I'm talking about!
SpongeBob: [the A falls on SpongeBob's tongue] Mmm, strawberry!
[bubble transition] [SpongeBob looks down on his clock]
SpongeBob's Clock: Tick!
SpongeBob: Oh no, now we're only going to be 14 minutes early for work! [running in circles frantically] Oh, there's got to be a shortcut around here somewhere!
Squidward: Oh, for the last time [drawing the straight line again] straight line, point A, there's no shortcut!
SpongeBob: There is always a shortcut!
Squidward: What moron told you that?
Patrick: [walking by] There's always a shortcut!
Squidward: [Realizing Patrick told SpongeBob that statement] Huh.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob puts on an explorer hat] Squidward, I am going to find that shortcut!
Squidward: Look, the Krusty Krab is right at the end of the block!
[exterior shot of the Krusty Krab with Mr. Krabs outside]
Mr. Krabs: Yoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're not going to come with me?
Squidward: No, SpongeBob. I'm just going to struggle through the rest of this walk, alone.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess this is where we part ways. But I can't wait to see your face when you get to work and I'm already there! [laughs] That's the face! That's the look! [laughs as Squidward walks to the Krusty Krab] [SpongeBob runs off the road to find the "shortcut"] [singing while going through many landmarks] First you do a zig, then you take a little zag, that's how find you a shortcut! Crawl underneath the fence, struggle through a bush, and that's how you find a shortcut! [notices Squidward] Huh?
Squidward: Straight line, point A to point B. You're still not getting it.
SpongeBob: Oh, tartar sauce! Maybe I should've zagged when I zigged! [singing again, going through more landmarks] First you do a zag, crawl underneath the fence, then you take a little zig, that's how you find a shortcut! [laughs] There, that's better. [SpongeBob notices he's in a darker part of town] [laughs nervously] Now this is what I call a real great shortcut. Now all I have to do is remember my wilderness training so I don't get lost! [SpongeBob imagines of what Sandy said to him]
Sandy: [in a thought bubble] First rule of wilderness training, is map out your course, by taking note of local landmarks!
[SpongeBob's imagination bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Local landmarks... [SpongeBob looks left and right spotting local landmarks] A-ha! [pointing to a large and unusual shell] Right at this large and unusual shell. [the creature under the shell emerges and walks away] Right at this abandoned sofa, and jog left at the broken fire hydrant. [SpongeBob spots what appears to be the sign to the Krusty Krab] There it is, the Krusty Krab! [SpongeBob climbs over the fence to see it]
[the scene transitions to the real Krusty Krab, where we see various still images of the inside of the restaurant until we see Squidward relaxing]
Squidward: Ahhhh.... [Mr. Krabs appears]
Mr. Krabs: Well, look at this. Lazing about. [in a mocking voice] Can I get you anything else, another pillow, maybe? A cappuccino machine?
Squidward: No thanks, I got one! [Squidward pours himself a mug of cappuccino with an image of his face in it] Perfect. No customers. No SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause.
[the scene transitions back to SpongeBob, where SpongeBob finds what he thinks is the Krusty Krab. He comes right up to it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Krabby Krust?! [SpongeBob notices a guy painting signs] Is that the name of a restaurant?
Sal: No, it's a typo.
SpongeBob: Could you perhaps tell me how to get to the Krusty Krab from here?
Sal: Never heard of it.
SpongeBob: Oh, you should try it! It's the best place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom! [SpongeBob hands the fish coupons] Here, take these coupons!
Sal: Thanks! I'm going to go there right now! [the fish hands his paintbrush to SpongeBob and drives away in his truck]
SpongeBob: I thought you didn't know where the Krusty Krab was! Oh, what do I do now? [cries] [SpongeBob imagines Sandy again, who is hammering a tent to the ground. When Sandy talks to him, SpongeBob stops crying]
Sandy: [in thought bubble] Remember, your landmarks!
[SpongeBob's imagination bubble disappears]
SpongeBob: Sandy's wilderness tips are always on the money! [SpongeBob goes back the way he came] Okay, let's see, I came from...no, I came... [running in circles] I'm lost! [screams, until he spots the broken fire hydrant he previously saw] Hey, there's one of my landmarks! The broken fire hydrant! [sits down near the hydrant] Hello, hydrant! I'm going to call you Heidi. Heidi the Hydrant! [SpongeBob notices many broken fire hydrants] So many broken fire hydrants. What do I do now, Heidi? If only I could telephone Squidward. He'd help me out. [sees a payphone] Hey, that thing looks kind of like a phone. [walks to it] Wow, this is weird. It's like a phone, but you put money in it. [shakes himself upside down; a dime falls out] My last dime. [picks up phone] I hope this works. [puts dime in coin slot. The cash register phone rings at the Krusty Krab. Squidward groans and answers it]
Squidward: Krusty Krab. May I reluctantly help you?
SpongeBob: It's me, Squidward. SpongeBob. I'm calling from the payphone.
Squidward: You don't say. How's that shortcutting going?
SpongeBob: Not good. I think I took a wrong turn at the abandoned sofa. All there is around here are broken fire hydrants. What should I do?! [beep from the phone]
Operator: If you'd like to continue this call, please insert another dime.
SpongeBob: I don't have a dime! Operator, please, please, can you tell me where I am?
Operator: If you'd like to know where you are, please insert another dime.
SpongeBob: Uh, hold on! [SpongeBob runs to the abandoned sofa, where three tough-looking fish are sitting on it drinking sodas (the main one sitting in the center, Scott, resembles Harold). He digs his hands under the cushions, and finds two nickels] Two nickels! I need a dime! Oh, I'm never going to get to work!
Scott: What are ya doing?
SpongeBob: Looking for a dime in this abandoned sofa!
Scott: This is our abandoned sofa, pal!
[Scott and the fish to the left of him, who resembles Scooter, give off mean looks to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: What ya doing there, drinking soda?
Scott: What's it tooya!
SpongeBob: Isn't it a little early to be hitting the high-fructose corn-syrup?
Scott: [he and the fish to the right of him, who resembles Charlie, give off surprised looks. Scott gets off the sofa and approaches SpongeBob] Hey, listen! I know this gigantic soda isn't good for me, but sometimes it gives me the kick I need to start my busy day as a pedicab driver!
SpongeBob: Ooh, you drive a pedicab?
Scott: Yes, sir! [Scott puts on a pedicab driver's hat and grabs his pedicab, which SpongeBob gets into] You need a ride somewhere?
SpongeBob: Yes! To the Krusty Krab, and step on it! [Scott drives away]
Scooter: Way to go, Scott!
Charlie: Yeah, he's almost saved enough to attend a community college next year! [he and Scooter clench their soda together and continue to drink them]
[Scott drops SpongeBob off at what appears to be the Krusty Krab again]
SpongeBob: [gets off of the pedicab] Thanks a lot, Scott! Stay in school! [SpongeBob notices the sign] Krusty Klam?! [gasps] Wait, Scott, come back! [Scott drives away, leaving SpongeBob behind] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob begins frantically running, and checks his clock]
SpongeBob's Clock: Tock!
SpongeBob: No! Over the cliff! [jumps off the cliff into the muck] Through the toxic runoff! [runs through a sewer pipe] Make a right at the disease-filled sewer pipe! [SpongeBob slides out of the sewer pipe] Face-first into this fetid muck! Over the garbage pile! Fall down this mountain of broken glass! Over the excruciatingly sharp razor-wire! [SpongeBob falls down with wires attached to him] Up this massive hill! [SpongeBob grows so tired he falls down flat on his face] That's...the Krusty Krab! And I'm still 2 minutes early! [SpongeBob crawls his way to the Krusty Krab] [SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab]I made it! I made it! [SpongeBob hugs two customers] Oh, random Krusty Krab patrons! How I've missed out! [SpongeBob jumps onto an old fish's lap and kisses her] Oh, how I've missed your youthful faces! [the scene then cuts to outside the bathroom with SpongeBob in it] I missed the bathroom, too! [two fish come running out screaming] [SpongeBob approaches a fish choking on his Krabby Patty] But most of all, I missed you, choking guy! [SpongeBob hugs the choking fish who spits out his chewed-up Krabby Patty, which lands on Patrick's Krabby Patty] [SpongeBob notices Patrick] Patrick? How did you get here?
Patrick: Same way I always do. Scott gave me a ride in his pedicab. [Scott, in his pedicab, appears outside and winks]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob notices Squidward] Squidward! Squidward, can you believe I made it?! [Old Man Jenkins appears to be hanging from the razor-wires on SpongeBob, and groans]
Squidward: Congratulations. [Mr. Krabs appears]
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, boy?! You're scaring all me customers with your foul stench!
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [pushes SpongeBob off of him] Oh no, lad, you're not coming in here looking like that! [shot of SpongeBob looking like a wreck] You're going straight home for a nice long bubble bath! [Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob outside]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir!
Squidward: What?! He gets to go home and take a bubble bath?! That's my thing!
Mr. Krabs: Yes it is. And consequently, you are just neat as a pin! Now get to work!
Squidward: I'm as neat as a pin? I'll show you neat as a pin! [Squidward runs outside, and gets himself dirty by rolling in dirt, ripping off his shirt, and pouring dirt on his head] Where's my bubble bath, Mr. Krabs?! [Mr. Krabs sprays Squidward with a hose]
Mr. Krabs: There you go! [a truck passes by and drives over a puddle, spraying Squidward, who is already laying in the puddle, with more water] Now get to work! [Sal exits out of his truck]
Sal: Uh, you guys open? I have coupons! "Buy one, get one free!"
Mr. Krabs: Oh no! It says "Buy one for a fee!"
Sal: Oh! I stand corrected! [Mr. Krabs and Sal walk off-screen, leaving Squidward in the puddle, as the episode ends]


[the episode starts in Pearl's room]
Pearl: Ooh! [kissing a magazine] Mwah, mwah, mwah! Aaahhh!!! Num-num-num-mmm... Mwah! [calling Marina]
Marina: [cell phone rings and she picks up] Hi, Pearl.
Pearl: Hey, girl! Let's hang out!
Marina: Uh, I can't, I have to work at Hot-Dog on a String today. Brad called in sick, so I'm in charge of stringing the dogs. Totally lame.
Pearl: I guess I'll see you later then.
Boy Customer: Uh... Can I get one with extra string?
Marina: Ugh.
Nocturna: [phone rings] What?
Pearl: [calling Nocturna] Hey, girl! Want to come over and make fun of boys or something?
Nocturna: Uh, sorry, girl, I can't. I'm working at Scorched Coral all day. It's heinous.
Pearl: [laughs] Oh! So heinous. See ya later.
Nocturna: See ya later, Pearl.
Girl Customer: How much is this choker?
Nocturna: Um, it's a wrist band.
Girl Customer: [gasping and choking]
Nocturna: Awesome.
Nixie: [cell phone rings] Nixie speaking.
Pearl: [calling Nixie] Nixie! My bestest friend in the whole wide world. You should come over. We can watch TV and eat cheese!
Nixie: I wish I could, Pearl, but I have to work at Dangles and Bangles. All dangles are half off with the purchase of any bangle. Dangle must be of equal or lesser value than bangle. Some restrictions may apply.
Pearl: Oh, you don't work at the mall, do you, Derek?
Derek: No, but all my girlfriends do. [ding]
Pearl: Daddy! Guess what?
Mr. Krabs: [gasps, swallows his wallet, chuckles] I have no idea, Pearly.
Pearl: Dad, I'm getting a job today.
Mr. Krabs: [shouts] Yahoo! Oh, this is great news, Pearl, me dear!
Mr. Krabs: Now instead of wasting my precious money on your "clothes" and your "school supplies"... [chuckles] You can waste your own.
Pearl: I'll be an independent working woman, blazing my own trail and standing on my own two fins.
Mr. Krabs: That's the spirit.
Pearl: Oh, can I borrow $10?
Mr. Krabs: I'll miss you around the house.
Pearl: Oh, Daddy, you'll see me after work.
Mr. Krabs: I was talkin' to the money.
Pearl: [at the mall]Hey, Marina! I'm here to apply for a job.
Marina: You should meet the manager, I guess. He's in his office. Mr. Pepalino, there's someone here for a job.
Pearl: Ah!
Marina: [straining, grunting, groaning]
Pearl: I-I don't think he's in there.
Mr. Pepalino: [muffled moaning, mumbling, groaning, gargling] We're not hiring.
Nocturna: Welcome to Scorched Coral. Please go away. Oh, hey, Pearl. What are you doing here?
Pearl: I would like to apply for a job, please.
Nocturna: Yeah, sorry. You're a little late. We were hiring, but we actually just hired someone today.
Pearl: Ah! Oh, Nixie, I need to work at Dangles and Bangles! This is my last chance, you gotta help me out here! Oh, please, please, please, please, please!
Nixie: Come on, let me introduce you to the manager. This is--
Bangles and Dangles manager: Nope, not hiring.
Pearl: You don't understand. I have to work here!
Bangles and Dangles manager: Sorry, missy, the only thing we don't dangle here... is hope.
Pearl: Oh, bangles. Ah... [belches] Oh, this is the worst. If I don't get a job at the mall, I'm gonna have to hang out with my dad! [sighs]
Beatrice: You looking for a job, deary?
Pearl: Yeah! I need one as soon as possible. It's a life or death situation, actually.
Beatrice: Oh, my goodness. Are you in danger?
Pearl: In danger of never seeing my friends 'cause I don't have a job.
Beatrice: Come with me.
Pearl: [gasps as she follows] Weird. I've never been in this part of the mall before. [gasps] Ugh! What's that smell?
Beatrice: Oh, probably one of the many perfumes that we sell here at Grandma's Apron! Congratulations! You're hired.
Pearl: [gasps] Oh, this is the best day of my life!
Beatrice: [groaning] Ah! [back pops] Well, I can't quite afford to be picky these days. The only other employee besides me was Myrtle, and she's... no longer with us.
Both: [shrieks]
Myrtle: Almost forget my shades! See ya later, suckers! [laughing]
Marina: Hey, Pearl. Over here.
Nocturna: Did you find a job?
Pearl: Yeah, I got a job at Grandma's Apron.
Marina: [laughing] Pearl, you cannot be serious.
Nocturna: Ew, that store is for old people.
Nixie: [laughing] Old people are so... old.
Pearl: Old people aren't that bad. Are they?
All: [laughter]
Marina: Hey, girls. I smell moth balls.
Pearl: Well, we are having a sale on them. They're 25% off today.
Nocturna: Um, isn't it your nap time, Pearl?
Nixie: Where's your muumuu, granny?
All: [laughter]
Beatrice: Oh, don't let those bubble-headed nincompoops get to you, Pearly.
Pearl: But it's not fair.
Beatrice: Life's not fair, my dear. We all go through hard times at some point. Here, look. See? I was different from the other girls, and they teased me for it. They called me "Boring Beatrice." Not very creative, those girls. [chuckles while showing a picture]
Pearl: Who would even take a picture of that?
Beatrice: Oh, good ol' Jonesy from the AV Club took that one!
Pearl: Wait, but who took that picture--
Beatrice: All that matters, Pearly, my dear, is that things will soon change. But in the meantime, you should be having as much fun as possible. Let me show you how grandmas do it.
Both: [laughter]
Pearl: Whoa, come back here, yarn! [panting]
All: [gasp, when Pearl walks over]
Marina: [laughing] Love the shoes, Pearl.
Pearl: You guys just don't get it. Being a grandma is fun. I get to sit in a rocking chair, dust tchotchkes, bake cookies, knit mittens, hats, and scarves.
All: [laughter]
Nocturna: Scarves.
Pearl: It's actually, like, the most coral store in the whole mall, so you can all just... just... eat barnacles!
All: [laughter]
Beatrice: Now, now, girls. Let's be polite.
Marina: What are you gonna do about it, granny? [grunting menacingly]
Beatrice: Granny power! Power! Power! [echoing]
Marina: [screams]
All: [screaming]
Beatrice: Pearl, toss me the Autumn Years perfume.
Pearl: Hi-ya!
All: [screaming]
Marina: It smells like pills and bed pans. Whoa!
Beatrice: [laughing]
All: [whimpering]
Beatrice: Well, now that you're all sitting down, let me tell you about the first time I ever saw a talking picture show. Oh, boy, did they know how to talk.
Nixie: No, please! I can't take anymore!
Marina: It's... so... boring!
Nocturna: No, I hate the past!
Narrator: One hour later...
Beatrice: And that's why today, we all wear shoes.
Marina: Okay, okay, we get it, we will stop being mean, I promise, just let us go!
All: Whoa! [groaning]
Marina: Listen, Pearl. We didn't mean to hurt your feelings or anything. We just, like, think it's weird that you're, like, a grandma now, or whatever. We don't really get it.
Pearl: Well, I don't care what you think anymore anyway. I'm being true to myself, and--and that's all that matters!
All: Eh.
Pearl: I'm a grandma now. Right, Beatrice?
Beatrice: Oh, Pearl, I'm so glad you enjoy being a grandma, but your friends make a good point. You're only young once, you see. You don't want to grow up too fast or you'll miss out on all the fun.
Pearl: I guess you're right. Being a grandma is nice and all, but I do miss being a super hip young person.
Beatrice: Go have yourself some fun, my dear. Ah, ah, ah, ah. How 'about a nice, gentle handshake instead? [groans]
Pearl: Hey, wait up, guys! I want to be friends while I'm still young!
Beatrice: I'll see you tomorrow.
SpongeBob: [appears] You dropped this.


[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is peeking through his window with his binoculars.]
SpongeBob: [imitates static and talks through walkie-talkie] This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob, reporting to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick. [imitates static] There are no signs of crime in front of my house. Any criminal activity by you? Over. [imitates static]
[At Patrick's house, Patrick is also peeking around with his binoculars.]
Patrick: [imitates static and talks through walkie-talkie] Uh...I've got a visual on an old lady tying her shoes. [slides down his house; whispers] She's doing the old granny knot.
Old Lady: Oh, I'll give you a granny knot!
Patrick: [grunts as he flips over] All clear! No crime here.
[The old lady snatches the wallet from Patrick's pocket with her teeth and hops away. Squidward walks out of his house with luggage.]
SpongeBob: [imitates static] Patrick, emergency meeting at Squidward's house—ASAP! [he and Patrick stop in front of Squidward on their knees] Oh please, Squidward, don't move away! You can't leave the neighborhood! Aw, we were just starting to get close. [whimpers]
Patrick: [grabs Squidward and hugs him tightly; he inhales] I swear, I'll haunt your nightmares if you move away!
Squidward: [pushes Patrick away] I'm not moving away, you brainless bottom feeders!
[SpongeBob and Patrick suck and eat the sand like bottom feeders.]
Squidward: I'm just taking a week's vacation away from you morons.
SpongeBob: [squeals as he jumps in Squidward's arms and whispers in his ear] Thank you.
[Squidward drops SpongeBob to the ground.]
SpongeBob: [grabs Squidward's suitcase] Let me help you carry this.
Squidward: No—wait, no!
[SpongeBob and Squidward pull the suitcase open and all of Squidward's belongings fly everywhere.]
SpongeBob: [removes underwear off his head] Oh—your unmentionables.
[Squidward swats the underwear away in anger.]
Patrick: I won't mention this bra.
Squidward: It's not a bra! It's a pectoral girdle. I don't care about my clothes. I just wanna get away from you two. And while I'm away—huh...
[Patrick tries on some of Squidward's clothes, but it rips onto SpongeBob's face. Squidward gets really angry and his head explodes like a bomb.]
Squidward: [packs his suitcase] While I am gone, there will be a paying guest renting my place. Don't bother him! [leaves]
[The scene changes to a taxi pulling up at Squidward's house.]
SpongeBob: [imitates static and talks through walkie-talkie] This is Junior Crime Breaker SpongeBob to Junior Crime Breaker Patrick. I've got a visual on a cab. Can you get a make on who the passenger is? Over. [imitates static]
Patrick: [imitates static and talks through walkie-talkie, but is blindfolded by Squidward's pectoral girdle] I can't see anything through these unmentionables. [imitates static]
[The passenger comes out of the taxi, which turns out to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis, Man Ray.]
TV Announcer: Who's this tacky tourist turning up in taxi? Why, it's none other than that mortal enemy of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, the evil Man Ray!
Man Ray: Hey, dude, keep it down. I'm not doing any evil this week. I'm on vacation!
TV Announcer: Really?
Man Ray: Yes, really. [hums cheerfully as he enters Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Aw, he went inside! Patrick, wouldn't it be great to have another friend who could join our Junior Crime Breakers? Ooh, I gotta get a look at him!
Patrick: [squeals quietly] We can blast him out. [holds up a huge TNT dynamite]
SpongeBob: No, no! Squidward said not to bother the man. [Patrick throws away the dynamite] So, we gotta be sneaky.
[SpongeBob and Patrick sneak behind Squidward's house to take a look at Man Ray. Patrick pounds on the window.]
SpongeBob: Shh! He must've gone upstairs.
[SpongeBob and Patrick run back to the front of Squidward's house.]
Patrick: Well, how do we get up there?
SpongeBob: "Eye" have just the thing! [giggles and grabs his right eye] Ow!
[SpongeBob swings his eye, throws it, and ties it to an open window. Inside, Man Ray is sleeping on Squidward's chair and feels a cold breeze of wind.]
Man Ray: [shivers] Oh, it's getting chilly.
SpongeBob: [Man Ray slams the window on SpongeBob's eye] Ow! [groans weakly; Man Ray slams the window on SpongeBob's eye again] D'ow! [SpongeBob pulls his eye down to avoid getting slammed on by the window] Ow! [SpongeBob reels his eye back on his face] Oof! [his eye is completely flat like a pancake; he yelps when he blinks it] Ow.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick ringing the doorbell while bringing a pie.]
SpongeBob: Now, I know Squidward said not to bother his guest, but there's nothing wrong with a welcome-to-the-neighborhood pie. [giggling squeals]
Man Ray: [answers the door] Oh! May I help you? I was just finishing up in the bathroom.
SpongeBob: [hands Man Ray the pie] Hello. Welcome to the neighborhood! [enters Squidward's house]
Patrick: Don't mind us. [enters Squidward's house]
Man Ray: Wha...Hmm. [closes the door]
[SpongeBob and Patrick each take a seat in two of Squidward's furniture. One of which Patrick breaks.]
Man Ray: Is this sand?
Patrick: Hamper sand—from my hamper.
Man Ray: [quietly] Ugh!
SpongeBob: Yeah, stranger, we got a nice little town here—thanks to the Junior Crime Breakers. And we're always looking for new members. You look pretty fit.
Patrick: SpongeBob. He's not putting out any snacks for us.
Man Ray: Oh, sorry! How rude of me. Hmm...ooh! All I have is this pie.
Patrick: Don't mind if I do.
[Patrick grabs the sand pie, eats it, and swallows it. After swallowing it, he smiles and sand falls out from his teeth.]
Man Ray: Eh—if you'll excuse me, I'll finish up in the bathroom. [heads upstairs]
Patrick: [pants] He's all outta snacks! [throws the pie plate away] Let's go.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we haven't asked him to join the Junior Crime Breakers yet. Hello, we were wondering if you'd like to—[screams]
[SpongeBob pulls out his comic book and frantically looks through the pages. He realizes that the paying guest that is renting Squidward's house is actually Man Ray. Man Ray is finishing sprucing himself up in the bathroom.]
Patrick: [quietly] Evil villain Man Ray.
[SpongeBob and Patrick run out.]
Man Ray: Now, what were you saying? [notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are gone] Hmm? What? Hmm? [shrugs his shoulders] Hmm.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick running to Shady Shoals Rest Home. They enter Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's room.]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man! It's Man Ray! He's right inside Squidward's...place. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy appear to be resting in frozen capsules] Too late. Man Ray must've gotten to them.
Patrick: [whimpers] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy ice pops! They finally made them! [goes to lick Mermaid Man's capsule]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, Patrick. We're both wrong! It says right here in issue 55. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are just taking their cryonic nap. But when they wake up in a week, they'll be weak for a week! [SpongeBob leaps towards Patrick] Patrick, do you know what this means?
Patrick: I'll have to wait a week for my Mermaid Man ice pop?
SpongeBob: Yes and no. It means that you and I will have to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and stop Man Ray's vacation of...[thunder claps] Evil!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [grabs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's rings] By the power of Neptune, Mermaid Pants and Barnacle Star unite!
[SpongeBob and Patrick unite the rings and disappear in a loud explosion. The results of the explosion causes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to abruptly wake up from their cryonic nap. The scene changes to SpongeBob as Mermaid Pants and Patrick as Barnacle Star climbing up to a window on a stack of trash cans. Patrick is seen licking Mermaid Man's frozen arm.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, is that...
Patrick: I couldn't wait a week! [throws away Mermaid Man's frozen arm and he and SpongeBob resume climbing] Yow!
[SpongeBob reaches the top, but Patrick pushes SpongeBob off. Patrick grabs SpongeBob, pulls him back up and hangs him on the window. Patrick then begins to lose his balance.]
Patrick: Ah-ah-ah— [sobbing]
[Man Ray is sleeping on the couch inside, unaware of what SpongeBob and Patrick are up to.]
Patrick: Good thing I'm so stealthy, huh, Mermaid Pants? [loses his balance] Ah! The stealth!
[Patrick falls but grabs onto SpongeBob's feet. Soon, all of the trash cans fall and crash.]
Man Ray: [wakes up] Huh? [opens the door] Hmm? [shrugs his shoulders] Hmm! [closes the door]
[Patrick climbs up to the window and pulls himself and SpongeBob inside.]
SpongeBob: Ow!
[SpongeBob and Patrick do their action poses. Patrick accidentally kicks SpongeBob and sends him crashing into a bookshelf, causing a huge ruckus heard from downstairs.]
Man Ray: Intruders? Mm-hmm...I've got to call the cops. [dials the number, but stops] What am I doing? Villains don't call the police! [sighs] I didn't think to bring any evil super-weapons on vacation! I'm unarmed! [hears loud noise] Huh?
[The ceiling cracks.]
SpongeBob: [looking through a lava lamp] Who'da thunk that Squidward would be stockpiling such a huge arsenal of evil super-weapons? [throws away the lava lamp and bites into some stale cookies until his teeth shatter] So stale, yet so deadly.
[Patrick steps back and trips over a bowling ball. He lands on one of Squidward's pictures and gets it caught in his buttocks.]
Patrick: I got my weapon!
[Patrick pulls the picture out from his butt. Man Ray grabs an umbrella, hoping to find a weapon strong enough to fight. SpongeBob and Patrick attempt to sing their theme song, but they fall down the stairs and land in front of Man Ray.]
SpongeBob: [gets up along with Patrick] ♪Dum-dah-dah!♪
Man Ray: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? I knew you guys were old, but I had no idea you mutated.
SpongeBob: Surrender, Man Ray!
Man Ray: I'm on holiday.
SpongeBob: Yeah, an evil holiday!
Patrick: Prepare to be framed! [grunts as he throws the broken picture at Man Ray]
[Man Ray opens up the umbrella and sends the broken picture crashing into a vase.]
TV Announcer: Vase vaporized!
SpongeBob: Here's a dessert that's sure to hurt! [throws the stale cookies at Man Ray like ninja shurikens]
Man Ray: Huh?
[Man Ray dodges the stale cookies and all of Squidward's figurines get fractured.]
TV Announcer: Figurines fractured!
[Man Ray flips over a sofa. The sofa crashes onto SpongeBob and Patrick and sends them dangling on the edge of Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick climb back in and continue the fight. Man Ray swings Patrick around and around.]
Patrick: No, no, no, no, no!
[Man Ray sends Patrick flying into Squidward's clarinet collection. Three clarinets lodge onto SpongeBob's head.]
SpongeBob: All right, Man Ray. I will snare you in my "clara-net!" [inhales and blows really loud music through the clarinets]
[Man Ray gets pushed by the supersonic waves of the clarinet's music.]
Man Ray: [grunts, shouts] Oof!
Patrick: [inhales purposely] Uh...I can't think of anything!
[Patrick charges towards Man Ray and attacks him while holding onto his head, causing him to fall over and break a table.]
TV Announcer: Table toppled!
[Outside Squidward's house, the sky is roaring with thunder and the clouds are pitch black. Man Ray jumps through the roof and throws SpongeBob and Patrick out.]
Man Ray: I just wanted a vacation!
SpongeBob: Evil never takes a vacation!
Man Ray: [stammers] Did you just make that up? Because that sounds pretty good. Do you mind if I use it sometime?
SpongeBob: Help yourself, Man Ray.
Patrick: Yeah, help yourself to pain! [thunder claps]
Man Ray: [face palms himself and groans] Why did I ever bother trying to be normal? [rips off his tourist clothing] I am Man Ray! Feel my evil wrath!
[Man Ray, SpongeBob and Patrick charge towards each other for their final battle. However, the loud thunder clap scares them and sends them falling through the roof and crashing into the kitchen. The phone rings.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Man Ray: Huh?
Man Ray: Hold on. I should get this. [answers phone] Hello?
Squidward: Hello, Man Ray? The weather changed my plans. I'm coming home. [grunts as the wind attempts to pull him] Not to worry, though. You'll get a full refund on the rent, so long as there is no damage to my place. [Man Ray hangs up] Hello?
Man Ray: [laughs evilly] That idiot octopus doesn't know I gave him a phony check! [smashes the phone with his fist and heads out the door] You were right about me after all, dopey duo. Evil never takes a vacation!
SpongeBob: Ooh! Definitely sounds a lot cooler when he says it.
Man Ray: [hears a horn honking] Ah, here's my Scuber. [runs out, climbs on the scuba-diver and drives away]
SpongeBob: Maybe one day Man Ray will reform and join the Junior Crime Breakers. [gets hit in the head by a board] Huh?
[Squidward's house is completely trashed up from the battle.]
Patrick: Man, he really trashed this place.
SpongeBob: Okay, Barnacle Star! Let's be super good and glue all of Squidward's stuff back together!
Patrick: Well, how do we do that?
SpongeBob: [chuckling] Oh, Patrick, it's right here in issue 14. [slurps] We have super saliva!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob gluing all of Squidward's stuff with their saliva. SpongeBob glues a clarinet together with his saliva.]
Patrick: [glues a cactus together with his saliva] Ow!
[SpongeBob glues some stairs together with his saliva. Patrick wrings out saliva from his tongue and dumps it in a bucket. Then he throws the bucket of saliva onto some broken furniture and magically repairs them. Moments later, Squidward enters the house.]
Squidward: Hello? [his house is all cleaned and fixed up] Oh, looks like my guest left already. [sighs] Home sweet... [slams the door and his house crumbles; he pops up from the rubble with a brick in his mouth, groaning] Home.


[The episode starts with an exterior shot of the Krusty Krab, but the two left maritime flags are messed up, suggesting something is wrong. In addition, the antenna on the roof is bent and the windows in front have huge holes broken in them, with glass shards scattered around the entrance. Then, several fish run out of the restaurant, screaming loudly. We cut to inside, where Mr. Krabs is sitting on the floor, cowering in fear as a sea bear swims up to him, growling and drooling into a puddle on the floor. The camera zooms out slightly, revealing a broken table, barrels scattered everywhere, and the edge of the Galley Grub menu, which has fallen onto the floor. Plankton, in a lion tamer's hat and holding a chair and whip, looks on from on top of the sea bear's back.]
Plankton: Why couldn't I see it before? [the sea bear roars very loudly, blowing Mr. Krabs' face back. Plankton chuckles] The way to get the Krabby Patty formula was so obvious! [he throws the chair and whip away offscreen, and hops down onto the sea bear's head] Spend an inordinate amount of time training several dozen sea bears to take over your restaurant and force you to give it up! [about eight more sea bears surround Mr. Krabs from all sides, all growling] Nothing can turn them from their central purpose!
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Yoo-hoo! [the sea bears all turn to look at SpongeBob] Who wants their tummies tickled? [he has a playful look on his face and is making a tickling motion with his fingers]
Plankton: No... [the sea bears all smile excitedly and dash away, leaving Plankton floating in mid-air] My weapons! [he succumbs to gravity, and falls to the ground so hard he bounces a little] Ouch!
SpongeBob: [standing on top of a green sea bear and tickling his tummy] Sea bears aren't weapons, Plankton. [the sea bear is laughing uncontrollably and waving his front fins around wildly] They're furry buckets of love. [the sea bear starts slapping his tail on the ground, making SpongeBob giggle] See? [jumps off the sea bear's stomach to the other side of the dining room, causing his work hat to fall off] And what do sea bears love more than tummy tickles? [pulls a jellyfish hive out from behind his back and holds it above his head] Jellyfish honey!
[Three sea bears, two green and one brown, see the hive and rush over to SpongeBob. The middle brown one already has on a pink bib with a jellyfish hive on it. SpongeBob pours the honey out of the hive onto his head and tosses the hive away; this makes the sea bears even more excited to the point of drooling. The middle one is rubbing his front fins together in anticipation, and the one on the right has hearts in his eyes and is flapping his fins up and down with his tongue out.]
SpongeBob: [sing-song] Come and get it! [runs out of the Krusty Krab, smothered in honey; all the sea bears swim out after him, breaking through the door, sending wood and glass flying, and knocking down the rest of the maritime flags]
Plankton: [running after his sea bears] No! Come back! [sees Mr. Krabs approaching]
Mr. Krabs: [angry, obviously] Why do you keep doing this, Plankton?
Plankton: [backing away] Heh-heh-heh... [falls down into a sitting position]
Mr. Krabs: [pointing a stern finger at Plankton] When you mess with me business, ya mess with me money! [clenches both claws furiously]
Plankton: [puts on a smile] Er, money's not everything, you know. [laughs nervously]
Mr. Krabs: 'Course it is! [seven dollar bills circle around his eyestalks] Money makes the world go round, and makes me heart go pound. [his heart becomes visible from his shirt, pounding in the shape of a dollar sign]
Plankton: [stands up, putting his hands on his hips] Well, if you love money so much, [mockingly] why don't you marry it?
[Mr. Krabs goes silent, then his mouth opens like a cash register, his lower jaw becoming a drawer divided into compartments, with silver and gold coins in the front one, and dollar bills in the back three; in the back of his throat a white tag with a red dollar sign on it pops up. He pushes his mouth closed.]
Mr. Krabs: [sadly] If I could, I would.
Plankton: [getting an idea] Would you now...? [laughs evilly while rubbing his hands together]
Mr. Krabs: You still here? [lifts Plankton by the antenna and pulls his left leg back]
Plankton: [startled] Yuhh! [Krabs kicks Plankton out of the Krusty Krab all the way across the street to the Chum Bucket] This gives me an idea. [pushes through the double doors of the Chum Bucket, and lands inside. There is a loud crash] Owww!
[Bubble wipe to that night. Mr. Krabs has repaired most of the damage done by the sea bears, except for a gaping hole in the roof, a bite taken out of the left wall, and the front windows, which are still broken. He pushes one of the double doors open, and sighs. He is carrying a garbage bag.]
Mr. Krabs: Ohh... another lonely evening... dumpin' trash... [He walks out of the Krusty Krab, over to two trash cans on the side of the road, one empty, and one overflowing with garbage bags. He lifts the lid of the empty one, drops his bag in, and closes it back.] ...alone. [he hears someone crying] Huh? [he looks around until he sees someone crying on a bench, illuminated by a street light; the "BUS" sign on the street light pole seems to give the implication that this a bus stop next to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs isn't sure what to do at first] Umm... [he decides to go over and see who it is] Hello? Miss?
[To his surprise, it is a stack of dollar bills wearing lipstick and a red bow with yellow polka dots. She stops crying and looks up at him. She's beautiful, and has green eyes with eyelashes, and sparkles a little. Mr. Krabs is instantly attracted to her; he sticks his tongue out and his eyes bloat up, and together they form the shape of a throbbing heart. He makes a weird noise.]
Mr. Krabs: [handing the stack of money a tissue] Ooh, careful now, careful. [smiles] Your ink will run.
[She giggles, and wipes her eyes with the tissue.]
Cashina: My, you're such a gentleman. [sniffles]
Mr. Krabs: Heh. [chuckling nervously while scratching the back of his head] Yeah, well... so, um... what's a nice denomination like youuu [points at her] doin'... on a bench like this?
Cashina: My date was supposed to bring me to the bank... [she starts to cry again] ...but he stood me up! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: [outraged by this] What?? [pointing to himself] Hey, if I met the scallywag that stood you up, I'd knock him down. [he winds up and punches the street light next to him hard, then turns around and smiles proudly; the street light, subsequently, falls off the pole and comes crashing down onto his head] Dooh! [the light cover, which is shaped like a scallop, hinges open, revealing Mr. Krabs' face and making him look like he is wearing a knight's helmet]
Cashina: [as a fanfare plays] My knight in shining exoskeleton!
Mr. Krabs: [quickly sliding onto the bench next to the money, looking at his claw and imitating James Bond] The name's Krabs... Eugene Krabs. [looks at her] And yours?
Cashina: [her cheeks blush a bright pink] Cashina. You're very sweet. [her eyes get all shiny]
Mr. Krabs: You know somethin'? [jumps off the bench and points at Cashina] You look like a million bucks when you smile. [Cashina giggles again; Mr. Krabs gets down onto one knee] Cashina, would you make this old crab's day [looks up and away anxiously] and allow me to take you to a place where you can buy me dinner? [smiles again]
Cashina: I'd love to...
[Cashina's face becomes completely transparent as the rest of her darkens, revealing none other than Plankton inside, sitting on a chair and controlling Cashina by means of a lever, a control panel with buttons, a joystick, and a microphone on it, and a camera]
Plankton: [puts his hand over the microphone] ...scam you out of your secret formula, that is. Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha! [he laughs evilly as Cashina's face reappears; she covers her mouth as Plankton's laugh only comes out as a small giggle.]
[Bubble wipe to the next scene. A green fish wearing a purple shirt walks down the road past Fancy!, a restaurant that looks like a huge ship in a bottle. Inside, elegant music plays as a waiter walks past carrying a covered platter and a bottle of wine with two glasses, along with a napkin. We zoom past some tables with fish seated at them talking, over to where Mr. Krabs and Cashina are laughing and enjoying a plate of spaghetti and meatballs at a table with a checkered tabletop. Judging by all the noodles and meatballs piled inside Cashina, she has already "eaten" quite a lot. As Plankton struggles to pull another noodle in through Cashina's mouth hole, Krabs is slurping on the same noodle at the same time. The noodle gets tighter and tighter as he slurps more and more of it, to the point where Plankton can be seen almost falling out of Cashina's mouth for a second. He just manages to pull himself back in before Mr. Krabs sees him. The noodle bridging Cashina and Mr. Krabs' mouths gets so short, Mr. Krabs has to lean over the table and Cashina has to stand on top of the plate of spaghetti. Becoming desperate, Plankton pulls out a pair or scissors and cuts the noodle, sending both Cashina and Krabs flying in opposite directions.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! Oof! [He lands on his chair, breaking it, and crashes to the floor. Meanwhile, Cashina lands on her back on the edge of the table so hard she starts sparking. Her left side becomes transparent, showing Plankton inside, being electrocuted. Mr. Krabs stands up.] Allow me. [pushes Cashina's legs down until she is sitting upright]
Cashina: This food is so delicious. Oop! You don't suppose it has a secret formula. [she stands up and flicks Mr. Krabs' nose flirtingly] I don't suppose you know anything about secrets... or formulas.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. I do have a very special recipe...
Cashina: Yeeeess...?
Mr. Krabs: [puts his arm around Cashina and slaps the plate off the table] ...for delicious kisses! [the plate can be heard shattering offscreen; inside Cashina, Plankton groans, then suddenly has to put his hand over his mouth to keep from throwing up. Mr. Krabs points to his lips] Cashina, would you mind if I kissed you?
Cashina: [smiles unsurely and turns around, one foot tiptoed] Oh, Eugene. This is all moving so fast...
[inside Cashina]
Plankton: [covers up the microphone again so it won't pick up what he's saying] ...just as I planned. [chuckles]
Cashina: Be gentle! [they both lean in for the kiss; inside Cashina, Plankton presses a gray button on the control panel with a picture of pink lips on it]
Robotic voice: Purse lips.
[Cashina's lips and a rectangular area surrounding them slide upward into Cashina, revealing another pair of lips on a rod which extends outward until Krabs' and Cashina's lips touch. Instantly both of them jump into the air as they jolt all over. After they finish kissing, both of them are charred and smoking.]
Mr. Krabs: [weakly] Wow, what a woman!
[Inside Cashina, Plankton is charred and smoking too. He covers up the microphone again, and some slight feedback is heard.]
Plankton: Ugh. Well, I finally did it— I kissed a crab!
[Bubble wipe to Mr. Krabs' anchor at night. The camera zooms in on his bedroom window. Cut to Mr. Krabs lying on his stomach on his hammock, giggling. He is holding and looking at a golden heart-shaped locket, but only the back of it can be seen at first. Krabs sighs dreamily and rolls over onto his back, then resumes giggling. We cut to a shot of the front of the locket, and finally get to see what he is looking at: the locket contains a picture of Cashina with one hand on her hip and the other fluffing her "hair," on a magenta background with red hearts surrounding her.]
Mr. Krabs: [now sitting up] Oh, Cashina... [he kisses Cashina's picture... right as his daughter Pearl opens the door and steps into the room]
Pearl: [cheerfully] Daddy, I want to... [The background music stops with a record scratch. Mr. Krabs gasps and stops kissing the locket, but it's too late. He shifts his gaze to behind him and sees Pearl's smile fade and her eyes open wide.] EEWWWW! [her face turns from shock to disgust and she points an accusing finger at her father] Are you kissing a locket with a woman's picture in it?!
[Krabs starts to sweat profusely.]
Mr. Krabs: [nervously shaking his head] Oh, no, no! [glances away to the right] I was, uh... [he holds up the locket, making sure Pearl only sees the back of it, and points to it] I was polishin'... this jewelry... with me... mouth hole... you see. [he sticks his tongue out as he speaks and points to his mouth, which now has red lips] Like this! [he closes his eyes, growing eyelashes, and kisses the locket several times] Right, hmm... [He puts the locket's chain around his neck, tucking the locket itself under his shirt to hide it from Pearl. He finishes by smiling goofily.]
Pearl: [screaming in Mr. Krabs' face, causing him to recoil somewhat] Gross! [storms angrily out of the room; her father gets down from the hammock and follows her]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, me little beluga... [Pearl stops, turns around, and puts her flippers on her hips; Krabs scratches the back of his head again] I never thought I'd say this, but... [raises a claw and smiles] I may have found you a new mom.
Pearl: [shakes her head] No way! [starts pacing counterclockwise around Mr. Krabs with her flippers out] I have seen stepmoms in movies, Dad. She'll make me sweep up the cinders, and then she won't let me go to the ball! [she stops pacing] And then I'll never meet my Prince Charming! [she starts bawling, and tears start spraying from her eyes like little waterfalls and flood the room]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls a string, which unplugs a cork stopper, thereby draining the ocean of tears Pearl cried and leaving behind a few puddles] Ya know, we're gonna have to have another talk about fantasy and reality.
Pearl: [who has stopped crying by now, but is still worried] Okay... then what's she like?
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] Well, she's... [A cash register ding is heard, and Mr. Krabs grins and his eyes get huge and shiny. He is surrounded by twinkling stars and dollar signs] ...everything I've ever wanted in a woman.
Pearl: [offscreen] Blech!
Mr. Krabs: [sees Pearl crossing her arms and snaps out of it] Oh, don't worry, sweetie. Nothing will ever come between us. [He scuttles over and starts petting her on the nose. Pearl smiles. Just then, the doorbell rings, and Mr. Krabs gasps excitedly.] She's here! Out of me way! [Pearl does not get out of the way in time, and her dad rushes past her so quickly that she spins around rapidly before slowing to a stop and flopping down on her back. Mr. Krabs gets to the front door and opens it for Cashina.] Hello, me little money stack. [he walks her over to the table where Pearl is already sitting in a blue metal chair, looking rather upset] I want you to meet me daughter, Pearl. [he sits in a plain chair, while Cashina hops up onto a barrel topped with a round red throw cushion]
Cashina: [awkwardly] Pearl, I... love your rouge. [points at it] How chic!
Pearl: [not amused] It's actually a rash. [she has a rash that looks like rouge on the left side and continuing about a third of the way across the front side of her nose]
Plankton: [inside Cashina, starting to sweatdrop] Uhhhh... Teen Talk, Teen Talk... [he picks up a purple magazine with the red words "TEEN TALK" on a yellow background on the front cover, and fries through the pages] Ah. Girls like shoes.
[while Plankton has been consulting his Teen Talk magazine, Cashina's face has become frozen in a weird expression, but it pops back to normal.]
Cashina: [pointing at Pearl's boots] Well, Pearl, I love your shoes.
Pearl: [getting mad, crossing her arms] I'm not wearing shoes. Those are barnacles. [a quick shot of Pearl's feet reveal that Pearl is indeed not wearing her white boots right now; she does, however, have white barnacles covering her back fins that look like boots from a distance]
Cashina: Oh, uh... heh... [raises her finger] I have some cream for that.
Pearl: [explodes] Stop trying to mom at me, lady! [She bangs on the table with both fists so hard that Cashina and Mr. Krabs both bounce in their seats. Pearl looks away and crosses her arms.] I don't need youuu!
Cashina: [becoming a little concerned] Well, Pearl, since I'm seeing your father, I hope we can learn to understand each other.
Pearl: [points at Cashina] You'll never understand me! [gets up so fast she knocks her chair over] In fact, I'm going to make it a point to never be understandable again! [she walks over to the bathroom doorway, but turns back and points at Cashina again] Blarb snobble goober blaaab!
[On the word "blab," she stomps her foot as hard as she can, causing the screen to shake briefly, and runs into the bathroom. Mr. Krabs sighs as Cashina jumps up onto the table.]
Mr. Krabs: Let me talk to her.
Cashina: [holds her hand out as if she's saying "stop"] No. I think I should do this alone.
[she ruffles her "hair"; bubble wipe to Krabs pacing back and forth in the living room]
Mr. Krabs: [groaning] Oh... I haven't been this nervous since me first boatswain's ball. [he is startled when he sees Pearl and Cashina descending the stairs into the living room]
Cashina: [telling Pearl a story] ...and I was all, "You call this a mugging?" And then I suplexed him until he gave me my purse back! [they both hug each other and laugh hysterically]
Mr. Krabs: [walking over to them with his claws on his hips] Hey-hey, you two! How about inviting me into your inside joke? Eh?
Pearl: Oh, you wouldn't get it, Dad. It's a "giiirl thing."
Mr. Krabs: [walks closer to Cashina and gets onto one knee again while bowing, surprising Cashina] Cashina, you know I love ya. [looks up at Pearl] And now me daughter loves ya too. Will you marry me, Cashina?
[Cashina studies Mr. Krabs' face. He is biting his lip and looks almost desperate, almost pleading. Pearl smiles really big excitedly, hoping Cashina will say "yes." Cut to inside Cashina.]
Plankton: [clenching his teeth, also excited] Eeeeeeee...
[Back to Mr. Krabs' face.]
Cashina: [holding her arms out] Yes! Yes! Yes!
[Pearl clasps her fins to the sides of her face. Three hot-pink hearts with dollar bills inside them appear floating above Mr. Krabs. Cut to inside Cashina]
Plankton: Perfect! [lifts his finger up high in the air] When we're married, he'll have to tell me the secret formula! [laughs evilly, then fist-pumps] Yeah!
[Bubble wipe to the Krusty Krab sometime later, possibly even the next day. The exterior of the building has already been decorated for the wedding. A red carpet leads to the entrance, which is surrounded by colorful lights that have been strung all the way around the Krusty Krab and even around the pole of the sign, which has a silver diamond ring sitting in the bottom part of the clamshell. The maritime flags hanging above the door and windows have been replaced by a white banner with small red hearts painted all over it; the banner is supported in the center by two big hearts— the bigger one is red, and the smaller one which is in front of the bigger one is closer to pinkish-red. Last but not least, some red, pink, and light blue balloons are tied to the chimney. A few boatmobiles are already parked out front, including a white limousine with yellow porthole Windows and a yellow spoiler, which is presumably for Mr. Krabs and Cashina. The whole scene zooms in slightly.]
Mr. Krabs: [from inside] SpongeBob! You're gonna be me wedding planner.
[cut to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob inside the former's office]
SpongeBob: [removes his work hat, puts his legs together, and bows] I'm so honored, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Great! [holds up a dollar as a cash register dings] Here's your budget.
[he hands the dollar to SpongeBob, who takes it]
SpongeBob: [stretches the dollar with both hands, then lets it go, causing it to make a snapping sound, and holds it up high] Mr. Krabs, I am gonna stretch this dollar until it begs for mercy! [he sees Mr. Krabs walk up to him looking rather offended, and starts playing with the dollar nervously] No... disrespect for your new bride.
[Cut to five onions, four heads of lettuce, six tomatoes, six Krabby Patty patties, and three different kinds of cheese sitting on a table that has been decorated with a white tablecloth. SpongeBob chops all of this up with his spatula, turning it into an amazing centerpiece with blue ribbon sticking out of it and a golden trident in the center. In a wider shot, we can see that SpongeBob has already decorated a few tables the same way. As Squidward, wearing a top hat with a red band and a wedding tuxedo with a red bowtie, puts a white tablecloth over a bare table, SpongeBob, in an outfit similar to Squidward's, tops the centerpiece with a whole tomato, then stands back and admires his work with a big smile on his face. Pink ribbon can be seen strung around a pole along with green confetti, with more pink ribbon hanging from the ceiling. A white banner with small red hearts on it, similar to the one outside, is also hung from the ceiling. After a second, SpongeBob runs away laughing. Just then, Patrick appears, dressed in a top hat with a purple band and a black bowtie, along with his shorts. He is also wearing white cuffs. He is carrying a plate stacked with plates and glasses, but is also rolling backwards on a wooden barrel. Squidward does not care and continues with his tablecloth.]
Patrick: [struggling to stay on the barrel] Huh, hee, whooah-oh-hoo-hoo...!
[SpongeBob flings a few plain patties onto a banner and the words "Krabs + Cashina" are spelled on screen. SpongeBob splats some ketchup in a cup. Then he takes that same cup and then gets a cup of mustard in his other hand.]
SpongeBob: Would you like our house red or or house yellow? [laughs]
[Afer they finish making the wedding decorations, the scene fades to the wedding going on.]
Wedding Manager: And now, the couple will exchange their vow.
Cashina: Eugene, you have everything I've ever wanted with a man: An exoskeleton, freakishly long eyestalks, and the secret krabby patty formula.
Audience: Aww...
Mr. Krabs: Cashina, you gave it to my life, but I thought I'd leave the rest of it alone. You showed me once and for all: If money can't buy you love, it can give you love.
Audience: Aww...
Wedding Manager:  You may now kiss the bride. [They kiss each other and get electrocuted again. The audience goes wild]
Cashina: Oh no, what about the bouquet?
SpongeBob: Uh... One bouquet coming up, Mrs. Krabs [He steals some flowers from the crowd and makes a bouquet and Cashina throws it to Patrick, causing him to eat it.]
Patrick:  [laughs with his mouth full] Hooray! I win! [he belches loudly]
[All the women start bawling, while a bloated Mrs. Puff just sits there sadly. Scene bubble transitions to Mr. Krabs dancing with Cashina.]
SpongeBob: [As Patrick picks his teeth with a toothpick] It's a shame Plankton couldn't be here.
Plankton: [inside Cashina] Ugh... Uhh... Uhh! Who knew Eugene was so light on his crab legs? [He vomits. Bubble transitions to Honeymoon Hotel, Mr. Krabs and Cashina's car pull up and they enter the hotel, into a room. Mr. Krabs takes off his tie and goes over to Cashina, who is on top of two pillows]
Cashina: Eugene, I don't want there to be any secrets between us.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what? Oh, I'll tell you everything. No matter how embarrassed, I wet the bed until I was 40. My armpits smell like tartar sauce when I'm afraid.
Cashina: Not those kinds of secrets.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, OK. Whatever you want, me sweet. Just ask.
Cashina: I want you to tell me... (scheming smile face) the secret Krabby Patty formula!
Mr. Krabs: The what?
Cashina: The secret formula... is locked away in your heart. Unlock your heart for me, Eugene. Let me in
Mr. Krabs: Oh, anything for you, baby. (He looks in both directions, Left and Right) I'm gonna whisper it to you, just in case there's any prying ears out there.
Plankton: Oh boy, here it comes!
Mr. Krabs: Alright, me sweet. Here it is. (He starts to get emotional) Ugh. I'm gettin' a little emotional. While, I never told anyone the secret... Krabby Patty formula before. [Cashina grins in anticipation] So, here goes. [he takes a deep breath, about to tell her the formula, but then grimaces as a tear falls from his eye] Erngh. [His tear falls into Cashina's mouth, causing her to explode and reveal Plankton inside a robot.]
Plankton: (Girl voice) Come on, Krabs [The voice starts to fade away into his normal voice] Let it all out! [Realizes Mr. Krabs sees him]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton?!
Plankton: No, no, I'm not Plankton [Tries to cover himself with a part of the robot. Imitating Cashina] I'm Cashina, you're blushing bride. I.. uh... uh... Am I blushing?
Mr. Krabs: You... monster! [He is about to crush Plankton but stops and groans loudly]
Plankton: You're not gonna crush me?
Mr. Krabs: I've been alone for so long, and for the first time in forever, I felt for someone. Well, I mean something: A pile of cash with lips. It was all too good to be true. Cashina may have not been real, but me feelings were, weren't they?
Plankton: Get a hold of yourself, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, are you saying it was all just a scheme to you? And you felt nothing?
Plankton: You're crazy! I'm out of here, and one day, the formula will be mine! Mark it. [He exits. Mr. Krabs scoops up some of the remains of Cashina in each of his claws and holds them close to his face, trying not to cry. He cries anyway. A doorman enters the room.]
Doorman: Oh, hey buddy. I want you to know: although your wife just ran out on you, you still have to tip me.[He puts all the cash into his suit, grabs a nickel and throws it. He catches it with his soup and makes a dazed face at it. The episode ends.]


[At SpongeBob's house on a windy evening]
Johnny: [announcing a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy marathon] Salutations, heroic devotees! I hope you're securely seated and sufficiently hydrated, because coming up next, it's the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy marathon!
SpongeBob: [pulling out a long list from his pocket] We got to make sure we have the necessary supplies for this marathon.
Patrick: Let's do this!
SpongeBob: Okay, how are we on snacks?
Patrick: Oh, hmm... I don't know. We might be able to pull through... [gestures to a wall stacked with ridiculous amounts of junk food] the first hour.
SpongeBob: Check. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures? [grunts, forcing six different action figures out of his craters] Check. Drapes?
Patrick: Check. [entering from behind purple drapes with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy on them]
SpongeBob: Lampshade?
Patrick: Check. [turns on Mermaid Man lamp he's wearing around his neck]
SpongeBob: Thermometer? [spits out Mermaid Man thermometer] Check. Ukulele, throw pillow, screensaver, incense, snail cozy, headgear?
Patrick: [with Mermaid Man orthodontic headgear on] Check.
SpongeBob: And... [Mermaid Man watch beeps, saying:]
Computerized Watch: It's time. It's time. It's time to fight... [groans] evil!
SpongeBob: It's time, Patrick! I hope we can make do with the few provisions we have... [SpongeBob and Patrick sit in front of TV. When the program starts, pedestrians scream and flee in fear when the Dirty Bubble appears. The Dirty Bubble eats a citizen]
Johnny: For sixty-some-odd years, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy have quadruple-handedly kept the sea crime-free. [The two heroes pop the Dirty Bubble, releasing the citizen] And in celebration of such longevity, we're kicking off this weekend-long hero fest with the never-before-aired Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Special! [SpongeBob and Patrick's skin peels in excitement] And now, without further fanfare, [fanfare plays] the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Spe-[TV turns off unexpectedly]
SpongeBob: No... [crashing sound, lights go off and windows are shattered] NO! [SpongeBob's house is ripped apart and thrown into the air, leaving SpongeBob and Patrick sitting there] No! This is terrible! How will we see the Origin Special now? [TV is blown by wind and is pulverized against the side of Squidward's house. SpongeBob and Patrick run to Squidward’s house and pound on his front door]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! Let us in! We're missing the Mermaid Man marathon!
Squidward: Go away! I've got better things to do than watch grown men prance around in ridiculous outfits. [Squidward's TV shows a man in a leotard performing ballet; the TV unexpectedly turns off] ...what? Circuit must've blown again. [opens door, letting the wind ruin his living room. SpongeBob and Patrick are also swept inside]
SpongeBob: Hey, thanks for letting us in, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah, we owe you one! [Squidward's house is also ripped apart by the wind and is hurled into the air] What now, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. All the TVs in Bikini Bottom are knocked out! We have to find a secure place, some place that can survive this whirlwind. [thinking] Hey, that's it. If we want to see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's origin, we'll just go to the source. Follow me, Patrick.
Patrick: Thanks for nothing, Squidward. [he follows SpongeBob, who is leaving]
Squidward: So sorry to have put such a wrinkle in your plans! [He screams as he is flung into the air]
SpongeBob: [both are grunting because they are crawling] We made it! [sees a welcome mat in front of the Mermalair secret entrance] Patrick, get up! We have found the Mermalair! [they proceed, but plunge into a trapdoor underneath the mat. They plunge into a net and drop onto the ground]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [exchanging glances] Again!
Barnacle Boy: [spotting the two on the ground] Oh, boy.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughing as they are dragged by Mermaid Man to they main control panel of the Mermalair] Again!
Barnacle Boy: Do you mind telling us what you're doing here?
Patrick: We wanna watch your TV!
Barnacle Boy: I hate to break it to you kids, but you'll have to go somewhere else. Our power got knocked out in the storm.
Patrick: But, but... now how will we ever learn about their secret "gorinin"? [he mispronounces "origin"]
SpongeBob: Hang on a minute, Patrick, we've got Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy standing right over here!
Patrick: ...Yeah, so?
SpongeBob: So, if we want to hear their origin, why don't we just ask them?
Patrick: Whoa! You're like a brain professor!
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, we wanna know how this all started.
Mermaid Man: You wanna go back to the start of it all, eh? Well, you see, in the beginning, it was all dark. And then all of a sudden, an event called The Big Splash formed the seas, and-
Barnacle Boy: Not the beginning of time, Mermaid-Brain. They want to know how we became a crime-fighting duo.
Mermaid Man: Oh... right. [thinking] Well, it all started when I was just a young, handsome muscular lad, [A flashback begins, showing a young, handsome Mermaid Man surfing and eating a submarine sandwich] when suddenly, I noticed that my washing machine had stopped. [Mermaid Man of the flashback grabs the clothes out of the washing machine on the beach]
Barnacle Boy: What are you talking about? [flashback ends]
Mermaid Man: Huh?
Barnacle Boy: You're supposed to be telling the story of how we became superheroes!
Mermaid Man: [facepalms] ...The story. Yes. I was a young, handsome muscular lad, soaking up the sun's rays on the beach, [a new flashback begins, very similar to the first one] when suddenly, I became drowsy. [Mermaid Man in the flashback falls asleep instantly] A wave came ashore, and drew me back into the ocean! [waves draw Mermaid Man in the flashback into the sea, he is drowning, and he yells "Help!" while coughing] Suddenly, I realized I was being sucked under by a violent whirlpool! I was running out of oxygen fast. [Mermaid Man in the flashback sinks to the bottom of the sea and gives up trying the struggle] But before I drowned, I was rescued by mermaids. [Mermaid Man in the flashback is carried through the ocean by two mermaids] They took me to the ocean floor, where they gave me a magic sea star that allowed me to breathe underwater. [Mermaid Man in the flashback inhales and exhales deeply, then falls asleep, the present Mermaid Man falls asleep also]
Barnacle Boy: Wake up, you old coot. Finish the story.
Mermaid Man: [wakes up after being nudged by Barnacle Boy] Huh?
SpongeBob: [excitedly] Yeah, Mermaid Man, what about Barnacle Boy?
Patrick: Yeah, how'd you two meet?
Mermaid Man: [slapping his temples] Oh, sorry, boys... There I was in the ocean, the only human who could breathe underwater. [flashback resumes] Alas, such a life got lonely real fast; I had no other humans to talk to. What was a man to do? Then my question was answered. [the bottom of a ship is seen in the flashback, then the port side of the ship is shown, where a very young Barnacle Boy is scraping barnacles off the wood. The captain of the ship appears]
Captain: Hey, barnacle boy, make sure you scrape the barnacles underneath, too.
Young Barnacle Boy: Aye, aye. [he takes a deep breath and lowers himself underwater to get the barnacles under the surface]
Flashback Mermaid Man: A boy in trouble! I've got to act fast or he'll drown. [he swims to Barnacle Boy] Fear not, young man. I'll take care of this.
Mermaid Man: [narrating once again] I used my new telekinetic powers to draw barnacles into Barnacle Boy's body, where they took the place of his lungs so he could breathe underwater, too. It was at that moment when we decided to team up.
SpongeBob: [the flashback has ended] Ohhhh, so that's how you guys got together.
Barnacle Boy: No, no, no... [shaking head and crossing arms] The reason I teamed up with this joker is because I was stuck breathing underwater for the rest of my life.
Mermaid Man: Oh... yeah.
Barnacle Boy: Anyway, from that day forward, we became
Johnny: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, superhero crime fighters!
Flashback Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: [new flashback begins, an alarm is clanging while people are shouting] A crime in progress! [A bank robber laughs maniacally as he is stealing bags of cash from the First Nautical Bank]
Banker: Stop! Thief!
Flashback Barnacle Boy: See if you think this is funny, evildoer. [He rapidly spits barnacles at the robber, knocking him down] Who's laughing now, thieving scum?
Banker: [shaking Mermaid Man's hand] Thank you, sir. And to whom do I owe this debt of gratitude?
Flashback Mermaid Man: You can thank me, Mermaid Man. [Barnacle Boy is seen shaking in indignity in the background]
Man Ray: [new flashback begins, Man Ray has the upper hand in a duel against Barnacle Boy. He laughs] You're mine!
Flashback Barnacle Boy: [shoots web a web of cheese-like material that binds and gags Man Ray] How'd you like to taste my tentacle zapper, Man Ray?
Flashback Mermaid Man: [dialing a pay phone] Hello... [indistinct response] So? What are you wearing? [indistinct response] Oh. In that case, can I get a large pepperoni pizza, extra cheese? Thanks. [Barnacle Boy slaps his head in disgust]
Mermaid Man: [flashback has ended] That didn't happen!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, yes, it did!
Mermaid Man: Oh no, it didn't!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, ha ha, like you remember. You don't even remember where you live.
Mermaid Man: It didn't happen!
Johnny: [the Mermalair's large TV suddenly turns on] And now, without any further delays, the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Origin Episode.
SpongeBob: [standing up excitedly] Oh, this is it!
Johnny: The story of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy all started here. [The TV zooms in on a series of red apartment buildings]
Tim: [Barnacle Boy is now a young adult dressed in a white t-shirt and jeans, in front of the television sitting on a couch] Come on, Ernie! The movie's about to start... Where's the popcorn?
Ernie: [Mermaid Man is now a young adult dressed in a striped shirt and khakis. He is waiting next to the microwave in the kitchen] It's in the microwave, Tim.
Johnny: [talking very rapidly as the scene he is describing unfolds as he is talking] At that very moment in the apartment directly above, a rogue scientist doing tests on radioactive ants knocks over a jar of his infected specimens, one of which, without any hesitation, crawls down one floor and miraculously lands undetected. It viciously bites our soon-to-be superhero. He screams in pain,...
Ernie: Ahh!
Johnny: ...stumbling backwards.
Tim: What on earth?
Johnny: In a split-second, both men find themselves in a freefall that sends them squarely through the roof of a vats of acid factory, and into a vat of acid that is tipped over by an errant alien spaceship, carrying the two blindly on a wave of acid during a solar eclipse on a leap year, precariously careening onto a bomb-testing site, where a cataclysmic explosion exposes our heroes in waiting to highly toxic radium gases. Then, as fate would have it, magical storm clouds move in, zapping both men with a neon-plaid lightning bolt and raining radioactive ooze, which, through centrifugal and electromagnetic turbulence, causes a powerful earthquake deep in the jungle two-thousand miles away, consequently unearthing a magical crystal with wings that flies to Ernie and Tim's exact location, and, powered by super gamma energy currents, pilots them to open skies until, not paying attention, the crystal clips the top of a billboard, flinging the two back to their apartment miraculously unharmed, when... [microwave beeps]
Ernie: Hey, the popcorn's ready!
Johnny: ...they proceed with movie night and eat slightly overcooked popcorn.
Tim: Mmmm... I think you overcooked this a little.
Johnny: Suddenly, an amazing reaction to the overcooked popcorn hits them with a jolt of cosmic super energy, metamorphosing Ernie into an incredibly strong, seastar-wearing superhero and Tim into a slightly less strong, but also super sailor-looking guy.
Tim: I have the sudden and incredibly urge to breathe water instead of air.
Ernie: As do I.
Johnny: And that is how they became the superheroes we have come to know as... [the heroes dive into the ocean from a dock and pose] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Defenders of the Deep! [The End graphic appears on the TV]
Barnacle Boy: Oh, feels just like yesterday, doesn't it, Mermaid Man?
Mermaid Man: ...No, not really.
Barnacle Boy: Hmm... Oh, so what do you boys think? Boys? [realizes SpongeBob and Patrick have left]
SpongeBob: [programming microwave for 12 minutes] Okay, Patrick, the overcooked popcorn will be ready in twelve minutes!
Patrick: This is gonna be so super awesome!
SpongeBob: So superhero awesome!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: No! Stop! But you're not superhero material! Look at those shoes! [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy keep on blabbering until the episode ends]

TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Fleet and forceful. With the ability to assemble and charge the creatures of the deep.
Mermaid Man: By the power of Neptune!
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man, with his young associate Barnacle Boy, fights for all creatures who live in the sea, against the forces of evil.
Villain: [holds a baby's lollipop and he spots the whirlpool] Oh, no! The Raging Whirlpool! [the whirlpool catches him and the lollipop falls on the baby's tongue]
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man! Champion of the deep.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! Champion of the deep! Woo!
SpongeBob: [dressed up as Mermaid Man] Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
Patrick: [dressed up as Barnacle Boy] Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man! I'm right behind you!
[SpongeBob and Patrick outside and sneak behind Squidward, who's relaxing on a lounge chair wearing sunglasses.]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good.
Squidward: [takes off glasses to notice the twosome, then puts it back on] Fun, fun.
SpongeBob: You know what this means... [pulls out a box of donuts]
Patrick: Donuts!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oohhh...
SpongeBob: [using a donut like a ring] By the power of Neptune! [Patrick bites into the donut]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, UNITE!
SpongeBob: Creatures of the deep, assemble! [both go into deep thinking] Think... harder... Barnacle Boy... [jellyfish swims by] Here they come! [Squidward blows jellyfish away]
SpongeBob: Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful.
Squidward: [under a tent] What the? Ohh!
SpongeBob: If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak.
Patrick: Jumping jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!
[Cut to Squidward destroying the tent in a fury]
SpongeBob: Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave.
Patrick: Right, Mermaid Man.
Squidward: SpongeBob! [chases after SpongeBob and Patrick, who run inside; Squidward runs up to the door and he knocks it hard] SpongeBob, open up!
SpongeBob: [Squidward continues knocking the door] Reflecto has found our secret lab.
Patrick: What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask him yourself?
SpongeBob: Elaborate, you vile fiend!
Squidward: He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
SpongeBob: Hmm, they must be working undercover.
Squidward: Yeah... now please leave me alone.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick bites into the donut again] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, reunite! [At Shady Shoals Retirement Home]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?
Manager: Undercover? Yeah... well, I'll see if they can take time from their busy schedule to see you. [SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing as they walk in] There they are. Right over there. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
Manager: Try not to surprise them.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Can you believe it?
Patrick: [holding onto SpongeBob] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk in front of the TV]
Barnacle Boy: Hey, who are those guys?
Mermaid Man: Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?
Barnacle Boy: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: Well, we used to be. But now we're retired.
SpongeBob: [shocked] But you can't retire. There's evil afoot!
Mermaid Man: Wha?! Evil! EEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIILLLL!!! [hanging on a coral pot] Barnacle Boy! Come quick! I've got the evil!
SpongeBob: All I said was, "there's evil afoot."
Mermaid Man: EVIL! EVIL! E...
Barnacle Boy: Would you please stop saying that?
Mermaid Man: [hanging on a water fountain] EVIL! Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil! [water squirts at him] Death raaaaay! [the manager comes, grabs SpongeBob and Patrick and throws them out]
SpongeBob: Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Patrick: It's too bad they're old.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. [real life captain gives a thumbs up and triumphant music plays] The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement! [fireworks appear]
Patrick: Oohhh! Pretty lights!
[At Shady Shoals Retirement Home's cafeteria]
Mermaid Man: To the meatloaf! [Receives a slice of meatloaf into his bowl] To the broccoli! [Receives some broccoli into his bowl. Mermaid Man looks at the cafeterian.] Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
Cafeterian: Here you go, son. Haha.
Mermaid Man: To the table, awaaaay!
Barnacle Boy: Careful! Don't run!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
Barnacle Boy: What do you want from us?
SpongeBob: Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
Mermaid Man: Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
Barnacle Boy: Will you cut... will you stop calling me "boy"?
SpongeBob: Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. [jumps onto one of the cafeteria tables where somebody is eating] And he globs onto the undersea dome. [puts his mouth on the table] And he starts sucking on the glass. [an old fish moves his oatmeal away from SpongeBob in disgust]
Barnacle Boy: What's your point, kid?
SpongeBob: You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
Mermaid Man: Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
Manager: [enters the cafeteria] What is going on in here?!
Mermaid Man: [points to SpongeBob, who stops smiling] You may kiss the bride! [SpongeBob gets kicked out and rolls home]
Patrick: Did you re-unite our heroes?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm married. [Back at the retirement home]
Mermaid Man: [he and Barnacle Boy are in rocking chairs] Up, up, and awaaaay. Up, up, and awaaaay.
SpongeBob: [dressed up as a woman and speaking in a Southern accent] Oh, myah. This purse is so big and heavy.
Patrick: [dressed up as a robber] Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that! [grabs SpongeBob's purse]
SpongeBob: AHHHH! Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp! [Barnacle Boy stomps over to him]
Patrick: [peaking from a building] It's working!
SpongeBob: [to Barnacle Boy] Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
Barnacle Boy: [yells at SpongeBob, ruining his makeup] Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
SpongeBob: [approaches Mermaid Man, who is sleeping with his eyes open] Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open!
Barnacle Boy: Confound it, get away from him!
Mermaid Man: [wakes up] STOP SHOUTIN'! I'M NAPPIN!
Barnacle Boy: [close up to his face] It's not me, you ol' coot!
Retired Elderly #1: Yes.
Retired Elderly #2: That's me.
Retired Elderly #3: I'm over here!
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: What do you want?
Barnacle Boy: This better be good.
SpongeBob: This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile! [The invisible boatmobile is shown almost completely covered in black paint and we also see Patrick smiling while holding a paintbrush with black paint on it.]
Barnacle Boy: GAH! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: EVIL! ...Where is it!?
Barnacle Boy: There it is! [points at SpongeBob and Patrick] You know what this means!? [opens up a box with shiny rings]
Mermaid Man: Donuts!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, brother.
[Barnacle Boy puts the ring on Mermaid Man and then they try to put both of the rings together, but they miss. Superhero sequence fails. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy wave their arms around up and down to synchronize their positioning of their arms. So then they attempt to unite both of the rings together a second time. Both rings are successfully put together but the superhero sequence fails again.]
Barnacle Boy: Say the oath.
Mermaid Man: [in his young voice] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite! [unite sequence succeeds while their rings are united together] Throw a waterball at 'em!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Waterballs! Waterballs! [Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob, but nothing happens]
Patrick: Hehehehehe...
Barnacle Boy: Mumbling morays. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Dogpaddle away! [they swim around SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: It's the Raging Whirlpoo!. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer as the whirlpool consumes them]
Mermaid Man: Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
Barnacle Boy: Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Sea creatures, unite! [they summon the sea creatures, but they are retired, so they come slowly]
Barnacle Boy: Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
Mermaid Man: Sea creatures! ATTACK!!!
SpongeBob: Pinch me, I must be dreaming. [sea creatures, now carrying torches and pitchforks, pick up SpongeBob and Patrick] Mission accomplished, Patrick!
Patrick: Yeah, we did it! [sea creatures throw them out]
Mermaid Man: I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
Barnacle Boy: We did it, you ol' coot. [they shake hands]
Mermaid Man: [confused] Who are you? [Barnacle Boy becomes annoyed]
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy play checkers.]
[Mermaid Man places a black checker on the board. A "Pow!" pow-bubble appears. Barnacle Boy replies by placing a red checker on the board. "Clack!" appears. Mermaid Man sweats, then places a black checker to the end of the board. A "King Me!" appears. Suddenly the phone rings.]
Mermaid Man: It's the Aquaphone! [he holds the phone upside down] What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello?! [Hangs up phone. "HANG UP!" appears] The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed. ["SIT!" appears]
Barnacle Boy: Remind you of what?
Mermaid Man: Remind me of what?
TV Announcer: Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
SpongeBob: Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Patrick: It's all thanks to you. [SpongeBob gives us a thumbs-up and winks; "WINK!" appears]



[The exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple is shown.]
French Narrator: Ah, [The scene pan-fades into the house.] Saturday morning in Bikini Bottom. [The living room is shown.

They both look at each other.]

SpongeBob: Awwww. I worked forever on those life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[The scene cuts back to back to the TV, where Johnny Elaine is in front of the Krabby Patty mannequins.]
Johnny Elaine: ...for these life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[The scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Gary.]
SpongeBob: Hey! Spring-boob Squire-pin stole my idea!
[The scene cuts back to the TV, where Johnny Elaine is in front of the watery background again.]
Johnny Elaine: [a phone drops and the fish on the other line talks quickly and indistinguishably.] What's that? Oh. It appears I've made a slight error in pronunciation. [It cuts to his full-body.] The real name of the winner is - [It cuts to SpongeBob and Gary.] SpongeBob SquarePants!
[The scene cuts to the exterior of the pineapple.]
SpongeBob: [While the house jumps around] WHAHOO! [It cuts to SpongeBob.] Oh, I wonder when my [The scene pans out to show the Newsie Fish, holding a package.] prize will... [SpongeBob notices the fish.] get here... [SpongeBob takes the package.] My prize! [SpongeBob starts to cry and the Newsie fish holds out a tissue box. SpongeBob grabs the tissue and the Newsie fish runs away. SpongeBob kneels down and sets down the box. It tears open the box. He gasps.] Can it be? It is! [The scene changes angles to show the back of SpongeBob, from a distance.] The conch signal!! [He turns around and holds up the conch signal.] From The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, [He turns back around and then holds up conch signal again.] as seen on TV! [The scene cuts to a mid-shot of SpongeBob holding the conch signal close to himself.] I wonder if it still works?
[SpongeBob runs to window and blows into it. The scene cuts to the exterior of Shady Shoals as the conch signal continues. It then cuts to Mermaid Man, who is sleeping and Barnacle Boy, sitting on their couch, inside. Mermaid Man wakes up.]
Mermaid Man: THE CONCH SIGNAL! [He and Barnacle Boy jump up.] To the Invisible Boatmobile!
[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy then jump back into their seats. The couch turns around and the run, reveals an underground passage way. The couch's back bends backwards, sending them down a slide.]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: [While they are sliding.] Ah! Ooh! Oh! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ooh!
[The two then start falling downwards, upright because the slide corrected their position, into the Mermalair. Their butts start to catch fire. The two stop in mid-air, which puts out the fire.]
Barnacle Boy: Uh... Mermaid Man?
Mermaid Man: Yes, Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: We're not in the Invisible Boatmobile, are we?
Mermaid Man: Uh, nope.
[The two fall onto the ground and stand up. They walk around, holding out their hands to look for the Invisible Boatmobile.]
Barnacle Boy: I told you making the boatmobile invisible was a stupid idea!
Mermaid Man: Boatmobile! Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Barnacle Boy: It's gotta be here somewhere... [He hits the back of boat] Ow! Oh. Mermaid Man, [While the keys are heard] I think I--
Mermaid Man: [Off-screen] FOUND IT! [He turns on the boat and the back end burns Barnacle Boy.] C'mon, get a move on, son. [As Barnacle Boy walks to the front of the boat.] We don't have all day.
[Barnacle Boy sits down.]
Barnacle Boy: Ignition... [As he pushes a button] on.
Mermaid Man: Throttle... [As he pulls a lever up] on!
[The Invisible Boatmobile goes through a corridor. The exterior of Shady Shoals is shown. The ramp leading to the front goes up, and the Invisible Boatmoble flies out of it. It then goes around a corner. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hmm. [He goes back inside to Gary.] Maybe the conch signal doesn't work anymore.
[Gary meows. An entire roaring, then a tire screeching, then a cat screeching are heard outside.]
Mermaid Man: [Off-screen] Activate torpedo mode! FIRE!!! [His head crashes through the wall, next to SpongeBob's door.] Mermaid Man...
[Barnacle Boy's head crashes through the door, causing the wheel on the interior to fall off.]
Barnacle Boy: ...and Bob-acle...
[The door falls on the ground with Barnacle Boy's head still in it.]
SpongeBob: I can't believe it, Gary. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in our home.
[SpongeBob runs to the door and Gary meows. Mermaid Man dusts off Barnacle Boy.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I'm...
Mermaid Man: [points at SpongeBob] Oh, my Neptune! He's been horribly disfigured! Oh, blast us! We're too late!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, please. He's not disfigured. He's-he's just that sponge kid again.
Mermaid Man: Oh, yeah. Good to see you, lad. Say, Barnacle Boy, we gotta find out where that conch signal came from.
SpongeBob: Oh, that was me. I blew the conch signal, sir.
Mermaid Man: Alright. Where's the danger, son? Bring it on. Bring it on!
SpongeBob: Don't worry. There's no danger.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: No danger?
Barnacle Boy: Look, there has to be danger. You blew the conch signal. When you blow the... where'd you get that thing anyway?
SpongeBob: I won it in a contest.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: [Off-screen] Contest?
Mermaid Man: They don't tell us anything anymore.
Barnacle Boy: Look, Spongy, that ain't no toy.
Mermaid Man: That's right. The conch signal is an awesome responsibility. We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds.
Barnacle Boy: But you only blow it when there's trouble, or there'll be trouble. You got that?
SpongeBob: Yes, sirs!
Mermaid Man: Good boy.
[Mermaid Man pats SpongeBob on the head. He and Barnacle Boy leave. Mermaid Man turns back and he and SpongeBob point at each other and make a clicking noise.]
Barnacle Boy: Come on, come on, [Mermaid Man turns around.] come on. They're serving meatloaf today.
[Mermaid Man walks out the door.]
Mermaid Man: [As he and Barnacle Boy walk away, SpongeBob walks to the door.] Oh, goody.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mermaid Man. You won't be hearing from me for just anything. Only for the big emergencies.
[The bubble transition goes to the interior of Shady Shoals, where Barnacle Boy, who is wearing a swimsuit, bangs on the bathroom door.]
Barnacle Boy: [While banging on bathroom door] Will you hurry up in there?! And save me some hot wat...
[The conch signal is heard. Mermaid Man, who is wearing a towel, kicks down the door, which lands on top of Barnacle Boy.]
Mermaid Man: THE CONCH SIGNAL! Come, young ward!
[Mermaid Man runs away.]
Barnacle Boy: [Crushed] Coming!
[Mermaid Man jumps onto the couch. Barnacle Boy, holding his swimsuit, wobbles onto the chair. Because the two entered the couch too quickly, a spring goes back and springs them forward through the rug, down onto the slide. They slide down on their faces first, and Mermaid Man's towel flies off. The whirlpool transition shows a bird's eye-view of SpongeBob's living room. He is laying on the ground with his eyes shut and his tongue out. Gary is next to him. There is also a spot light on him. The tire squealing and the cat shrieking is heard. The angle changes. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy run into the living room. Mermaid Man stands behind Gary and Barnacle Boy gives Mermaid Man a new towel. Gary crawls away.]
Mermaid Man: Oh... youth! Cut down in its prime! [SpongeBob moans.] Oh, speak to me, son!
[Mermaid Man picks SpongeBob up.]
SpongeBob: Help... Can't... [He lifts a jar of mayo.] open mayonnaise!
Barnacle Boy: What?! [The scene cuts to the front door of the pineapple. The door opens.] [While he is pushing Mermaid Man out the door.] I come down in my underwear to open a jar of mayonnaise?! [He stops and the two turn around.]
SpongeBob: But...
Barnacle Boy: But nothing! We can't go around socializing. We have to be prepared for, uh, emergencies.
Mermaid Man: Barnacle Boy, think about it. Emergencies don't come around as often as they used to.
Barnacle Boy: Alright, okay. You can blow the conch every once in a while. Just give us [He takes the jar of mayo.] something to do when we [while he struggles to open the jar of mayo.] show up.
SpongeBob and Mermaid Man: [While jumping in the air.] Yay!
[The bubble transition goes to the Shady Shoals' cafeteria, where Barnacle Boy is eating soup. The conch signal blows as he grabs a spoon full of soup. He blows on it and Mermaid Man grabs Barnacle Boy's arm, while running, which causes him to drop the spoon.]
Mermaid Man: Danger!
[At SpongeBob's house, in his bathroom, Mermaid Man fixes SpongeBob's sink and Barnacle boy unclogs SpongeBob's shower drain. SpongeBob is shown blowing the conch signal. It then cuts to the library, where Mermaid Man is on a ladder, holding a book, and Mermaid Man is holding Mermaid Man's butt, so that he doesn't fall. SpongeBob is shown blowing the conch signal. It cuts to the living room, where he is in a barber's chair, reading the newspaper, Mermaid Man is shining SpongeBob's shoes, and Barnacle Boy is giving him a head massage. It then cuts to SpongeBob, at night, on his house, using the conch signal. It then cuts to SpongeBob, in bed, next to a teddy bear. Mermaid Man is reading a book and Barnacle Boy is holding milk and plate of cookies. It cuts to SpongeBob blowing the conch signal three different times. On the last time, Barnacle Boy takes it out of SpongeBob's mouth.]
Barnacle Boy: That's it! Gimme that! You're running us ragged.
Mermaid Man: [While crawling on the walkway of SpongeBob's house.] Must... must answer clarion call!
[Mermaid Man collapses.]
Barnacle Boy: We're exhausted!
SpongeBob: [While tearing up] I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy. I didn't mean it. I... just wanted to spend time with you. You're my heroes!
[SpongeBob starts crying.]
Barnacle Boy: [While SpongeBob is crying] It's too late for that, Mr. Contest Winner. I'm gonna destroy this thing with my... sulfur vision! [He tries to uses his sulfur vision to destroy the conch, but is unsuccessful. He tries again, but he still doesn't succeed.] I'll destroy it when I get back to the, [Puts the conch in his pocket] uh, Mermalair. Uh, and as for you...
Mermaid Man: Barnacle Boy, [While getting up.] don't squash his enthusiasm. After all, he could be the hero of tomorrow. Or the villain. Besides, I remember another [He takes out a picture.] young [The image shows Barnacle Boy as a kid.] whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero.
[Mermaid Man chuckles.]
Barnacle Boy: You don't even remember breakfast, you old coot!
[Mermaid Man walks up to SpongeBob, still crying]
Mermaid Man: Maybe the conch signal is too much responsibility. [SpongeBob stops crying.] But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?
Barnacle Boy: What?!
Mermaid Man: [While he and SpongeBob are running to the Invisible Boatmobile] To the Invisible Boatmobile! [Barnacle Boy becomes angry]
[The scene fades to later. Barnacle Boy is still angry]
SpongeBob: Oh...
SpongeBob and Mermaid Man: Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells, [Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and SpongeBob, who is now wearing a superhero outfit, is shown in the Invisible Boatmobile, which is driving down the street.] Barnacle Boy laid an egg, The Invisible Boatmobile, [The Invisible Boatmobile stops at a red light.] lost a wheel and...
SpongeBob: Hey, [moves to the driver's seat] can I drive?
Barnacle Boy: Drive? What do you know about driving the Invisible Boatmobile?
SpongeBob: Tons! Like the windshield wipers are right here. [pushes a button]
Barnacle Boy: DON'T TOUCH THAT BUTTON, IT'S THE... [Invisible Boatmobile folds into an origami swan] origami button.
Mermaid Man: [He and Barnacle Boy are scouting on top of a building] When you're patrolling the city, you'll always have to be vigilante. On your toes, [Turn to the right side of the building] constantly alert. Always expect the unexpec-- [Turn back to the left of the building. SpongeBob is on the edge] AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
SpongeBob: Hey! [scares Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and they fall off the building. SpongeBob goes to the rooftop] I've got the doughnuts!
SpongeBob &amp; Mermaid Man: ...and Barnacle Boy laid an egg. Hey-hey!
Mermaid Man: Oh, that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder. I know that he doesn't look like much, but he could go back to crime... [snaps fingers] ...just like that. [he and Barnacle Boy laugh]
Atomic Flounder: [SpongeBob pins the Atomic Flounder on the ground] Help! Help! Help somebody here!
SpongeBob: You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder!
Mermaid Man: Stop, kid! STOP!! Let him go!
SpongeBob: You said he could snap... [snaps fingers] ...just like that!
Atomic Flounder: What?! Get off of me! [pushes SpongeBob away] If I weren't retired, I'd, I'd... ROARRRRRR!!!! [roars, sending out a blast of atomic energy at Barnacle Boy's face. Barnacle Boy's head glows red from radiation, soon blowing up to form a miniature mushroom cloud, leaving his head charred] ...do that! [leaves] Outta my way, punk!
[At The Diner]
SpongeBob: I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day. So, what are we going to do tomorrow.
Barnacle Boy: Uh, uh, say, kid, why don't you take this nickel and go up there and see if our theme song in on the jukebox?
SpongeBob: Okay. [goes to the jukebox]
Mermaid Man: You know, for a pain in the neck, he's a pretty nice kid.
Barnacle Boy: Let's ditch him.
Mermaid Man: I'm right behind you.
SpongeBob: [looking through the selection of songs] It doesn't seem to be here.
Barnacle Boy: Oh, it's there, all right.
Mermaid Man: Keep looking. Diligence. Diligence.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir. [looks again]
Barnacle Boy: Dagnabbit!
Mermaid Man: What's the matter?
Barnacle Boy: Where did we park the Invisible Boatmobile?!?
SpongeBob: Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked. [deep voice] But I can't let my heroes down! [looks again]
Mermaid Man: Boatmobile! Where are you? [tries to find it] Barnacle Boy, I found it! [turns engine on and Barnacle Boy gets burned again]
Dirty Bubble: [laughs] Still getting burned on that tail pipe, huh, Barnacle Boy? [laughs]
Barnacle Boy: It's the Dirty Bubble!
Mermaid Man: In all his dirty roundness!
Mermaid Man &amp; Barnacle Boy: Oh, no!
SpongeBob: [runs outside] I found it and it's the special dance mix!
Mermaid Man &amp; Barnacle Boy: [trapped inside the Dirty Bubble] Help! Help! Help!
SpongeBob: Holy Krabby Patties! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis: The Dirty Bubble! I can't believe it!!
Dirty Bubble: [laughs] You cannot save them, Sponge of Mystery! They are trapped by my awesome surface tension! [laughs]
SpongeBob: You don't understand! You're my most favorite super villain! Can I get your autograph? [gets out a notepad and a sharp pencil as the point on the pencil glints]
Dirty Bubble: Oh, no. [Runs away as SpongeBob walks to him while pointing the pencil at him] Oh, no, you fool. Stay back! The point. Ooh, ooh! Watch the point! AAHH! [SpongeBob pops the Dirty Bubble with the pencil]
Mermaid Man: Aha! You saved us, son!
Barnacle Boy: Yeah, you're a hero!
SpongeBob: I am?
Mermaid Man: Are you up for another ride in the Invisible Boatmobile?
[Bubble transition to later]
SpongeBob: Oh...
SpongeBob &amp; Mermaid Man: Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells, Barnacle Boy laid an egg...
All 3: The Dirty Bubble popped and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and SpongeBob got away! Hooray!
Barnacle Boy: Watch out! [Short Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy stinger plays]

 
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join Bikini Bottom's noblest, boldest, oldest superheroes as they bravely prepare for vacation. [both pack their clothes into their bags while the words “FOLD” and “PACK” come up] But wait! While our heroes relax at Leisure Village... who will watch the Mermalair?! [Barnacle Boy opens the doors and SpongeBob and Patrick jump in]
SpongeBob: ManSponge...
Patrick: ...and BoyPatrick...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Reporting for duty!
Barnacle Boy: Yeah, yeah, follow me.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Up, up, and awayyyyyy!!
Mermaid Man: EVIL!
Barnacle Boy: Now, we want you boys to keep an eye on the place. Water the plants, and make sure that...
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh, Patrick! This is the greatest wall of superhero secret gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!
Patrick: I get the Aqua-Glove!
Mermaid Man: Hold on there, boys! You cannot play with this stuff!
SpongeBob: What about the Orb of Confusion? [turns the orb on and makes confused faces]
Mermaid Man: [turns it off] No, no! Prolonged exposure to the Orb of Confusion will give you... uh... confusion!
Patrick: [opens the boat's door] What about the Invisible Boatmobile?
Barnacle Boy: Especially not the Invisible Boatmobile! [closes the boat's door] When we say don't touch anything, we mean don't. Touch. Anything! Do you understand?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Loud and clear, trusted boy companion!
Barnacle Boy: Well, great. Here are the keys. [SpongeBob takes the key from his hand] We'll see you in a week.
Mermaid Man: [both run out the door] UP, UP, AND AWAYYYYYY!
SpongeBob: Come, BoyPatrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay! [both flip into the other room while letting out battle cries]
Patrick: Huh? MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA...
SpongeBob: What is it, trusted sidekick?
Patrick: MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA!
SpongeBob and Patrick: MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! Man Ray! Aaaaaaaahhh! [both hide]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?
SpongeBob: Looks like he's frozen or something.
Patrick: FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO!
SpongeBob: It appears to be some sort of prison chamber... [licks the chamber] ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible! Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him! [Patrick pulls the lever down to UNFREEZE] Pat, what are you doing!?! We're not supposed to touch anything!
Patrick: But you said you had a question.
SpongeBob: We could get in trouble!
Patrick: Well, that's not a question. [they both argue when Man Ray's eyes start to light up]
SpongeBob: They said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain! [pulls level up back to FREEZE]
Man Ray: I'm free! Hahaha!
SpongeBob: Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.
Man Ray: By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once!
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that.
Man Ray: Why... NOT?!
SpongeBob: Because you're evil!
Man Ray: You mean, if I was good, then you'd let me go?
SpongeBob: Yeah, sure, why not?
Man Ray: Then, uhhh, in that case... I am good.
SpongeBob: Really?
Man Ray: Yes, really.
SpongeBob: Really, really?
Man Ray: Yes. Yes. Really, really.
SpongeBob: Really Really Really???
Man Ray: YES, YES, ALREADY! I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD! NOW, LET ME OUT OF HERE OR YOU'LL SUFFER DIRE CONSEQUENCES!!
SpongeBob: Well, that's good enough for me. [SpongeBob pulls the lever back to "UNFREEZE" Man Ray is unfrozen and falls to the ground]
Man Ray: You fools! Prepare to be eradicated! [tries to jump at SpongeBob and Patrick but stops in mid-air and falls to the ground then laughs] What's wrong with me? Hahaha! What is this, HAHA HEH HEH HA, infernal contraption!?
SpongeBob: Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode 17!
Narrator: [showing a picture of the belt] As seen in episode 17!
Patrick: Oh, I love that episode.
SpongeBob: Oh, me too, me too!
Man Ray: I'll never get out of here wearing this belt! [chuckles] I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me. [chuckles again] Time for those acting lessons to pay off.
SpongeBob: Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
Man Ray: Oh, boohoo! Oh, sob! Oh, cry! [opens and closes his eyes] Oh, woe is me! You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
SpongeBob: We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go!
Man Ray: [turns around] Ahh, that would be fantastic! [chuckles] I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready for your first day at goodness school? [Man Ray puts an apple on his desk] Pat, get your wallet out. [Patrick gets his wallet out of his pocket] Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet. [Patrick tosses it on the ground] Now, what do you do?
Man Ray: Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet.
Patrick: Doesn't look familiar to me.
Man Ray: What? I just saw you drop it. Here.
Patrick: Nope, it's not mine.
Man Ray: It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.
Patrick: Return what to who?
Man Ray: [facepalms, then shows Patrick his ID] ...Aren't you Patrick Star?
Patrick: Yup.
Man Ray: And this is your ID.
Patrick: Yup.
Man Ray: I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet.
Patrick: That makes sense to me.
Man Ray: Then take it.
Patrick: It's not my wallet.
Man Ray: [in anger and frustration] You dim ball! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off! [SpongeBob pushes tickle button and Man Ray laughs]
SpongeBob: Ah-ah! Wrong. [SpongeBob pushes button] Good people don't rip other people's arms off! [Man Ray chuckles] Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?
Man Ray: Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help with... [Patrick drops package on Man Ray's foot] Ow!
Patrick: Oops, sorry. Can I start over?
Man Ray: I noticed you was... [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
Patrick: Oops! Gotta start again.
Man Ray: Would, [Patrick drops package again] Ow!
Patrick: Oops!
Man Ray: [Growls in anger] You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?!
Patrick: My wallets.
Man Ray: [Screams in fury. He grabs Patrick's head]
Patrick: No! SpongeBob, tickle him! [Man Ray slams Patrick into the ground. SpongeBob presses the tickle button]
Man Ray: [laughs] It tickles, but it's worth it! [continues slamming Patrick into the ground, while still laughing]
SpongeBob: Alright, goodness lesson number three. [Patrick is shown angry and severely injured] Uhh, let's see. [Patrick grabs the remote]
Patrick: I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?
Man Ray: Umm... 62?
Patrick: Wrong! [pushes button]
Man Ray: Haha! Stop!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.
Patrick: Let go of it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad!
Patrick: Let go!
SpongeBob: No, you let go!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Let... GO! [remote breaks and the belt goes hay-wire]
Man Ray: Frequency rising. Belt out of control. Hahahaha. Belt on too hard. [he continues to laugh] It's tickling my DNA. Make it stop! [tears come out as he laughs] Haha. Please!!
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.
Patrick: Peanuts?
SpongeBob: No. Please.
Patrick: Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.
SpongeBob: Rehabilitated.
Patrick: Gesundheit.
SpongeBob: It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future. [unlocks the belt, then the tickling stops] Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness. [Man Ray takes the Aqua-Glove off the wall of weapons] Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff. [Man Ray put the glove on his hand and activates it] We're not supposed to touch that, either. [Man Ray grabs the Cosmic-Ray and attaches it on the Aqua-Glove] We are really not suppose to touch those, sir. [He aims the weapon at SpongeBob and Patrick] Good people have no use for weapons such as... [Man Ray zaps them into dust] thoooooooooose!
Man Ray: [laughs] The only thing I'm good at is being evil. [door opens and Man Ray runs] So long, suckers!
Patrick: What's that smell, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.
Patrick: Good, I thought it was my skin.
SpongeBob: Forget about your skin, Patrick! Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him! This is a job for Mermaid Man...
Patrick: ...and Barnacle Boy! [both slide down the poles and get their costumes on]
SpongeBob: To the Invisible Boatmobile! [both stop in the invisible boat]
Patrick: Ignition, on!
SpongeBob: Wait! I don't have a license!
Patrick: Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license. [shapes hand into a rectangle]
SpongeBob: You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy. [they scream as the boat rams through the wall and into a street light]
Patrick: Thank goodness for invisible seat belts!
Man Ray: Out of my way, fools! You no longer have control of me. And now this town belongs to Man Ray!
SpongeBob: Not so fast, arch-villain! We still have the Orb of Confusion! [Patrick takes out the Orb of Confusion] Take this! [turns it on and gets all confused] Doy... Duh...
Man Ray: Well, that was easy. [heads to the bank where he kicks in the door] Hahaha! All right, people! Everybody stand right where you are!
[citizens gasp]
Man Ray: I want you to, uh... [Man Ray chuckles, so everyone else chuckles, too] No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to... [chuckles again, so everyone else is still chuckling] STOP LAUGHING, YOU FOOLS!
Bank Lady: What can I do for you, sir?
Man Ray: I'll tell you what you can do! [points glove at the lady] Gimme all of your... [Man Ray chuckles again] G-gimme, gimme all of your... [Man Ray is still chuckling] Give me...! [he chuckles so much he realizes what's going on] Aah! The belt is gone, but I still feel its tickle! The urge to do bad is gone! [sighs] I guess I'll just open a checking account. [Man Ray returns to SpongeBob and Patrick and turns the Orb of Confusion off]
SpongeBob: Doy... [gasps] Man Ray!
Man Ray: No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them! [Man Ray takes his head off and gives it to SpongeBob] I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder. [walks off] 
SpongeBob: Bye, Man Ray! Wow, we did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We saved the day! Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: Uhh... [still has a confused look on his face]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Woo-hoo? Patrick?


Narrator: Ahh, the Krusty Krab. Through these doors pass all the many kinds of undersea life. [two fish are about to leave]
Mermaid Man: Through the double doors! [bursts through the door, knocking the two fish away] Away!
Narrator: And also these guys. [Barnacle Boy enters the Krusty Krab]
Barnacle Boy: I told you I'm not hungry, Mermaid Man!
Mermaid Man: N-nonsense, Barnacle Boy, we've got to keep up our strength for the fight against evil!
Barnacle Boy: What a dive.
Mermaid Man: To the register! [runs to the register] Away!
Squidward: Can I help you?
Mermaid Man: A double Krabby Patty and Coral Bits for me, and a silly meal for the lad.
Barnacle Boy: It's not for the toy, I just... I've gotta fit in the tights, y'know? [he smiles nervously]
Squidward: Whatever. Five dollars, please.
Mermaid Man: You got it, bucky. [removes his left seashell cup, opens the shell up like a clutch purse and pulls out a metal nut] Will this cover it? [close up of the nut and a timpani noise is heard]
Squidward: ...No.
Barnacle Boy: [confronts Squidward] Listen, big nose, [points at Mermaid Man] that guy has been saving your butt since before you were born. Don't you got a living legend discount or something?
Squidward: This is a restaurant, not a lending library. [pokes Barnacle Boy] And who are you calling big nose, [pokes Barnacle Boy again] big nose? [both press noses against each other. Barnacle Boy gets out a $5 bill from his hat and he throws it to Squidward]
Barnacle Boy: Well, next time danger threatens, don't expect any help from us.
Squidward: [grabs the bill. Sarcastically] I'm shakin'. Heh. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
SpongeBob: [the wall next to the ordering window presses in with SpongeBob's imprint, and then SpongeBob bursts through] MERMAID MAN AND BARNACLE BOY!? MUST. GET. AUTOGRAPH. [stretches arm to pull a pen from Tom's shirt pocket and stretches second arm to grab a paper from the window]
Mermaid Man: If you wanna grow up strong like me,... [shows his fat belly, shocking Barnacle Boy] you gotta leave room for seconds. Here comes our waiter.
SpongeBob: [runs while making a weird face] AUUUUUTOOOOOGRAAAAAPH!
Barnacle Boy: Holy sea cow, it's that Sponge-kid!
Mermaid Man: Quick, lad! [pants falls down] To the invisible boatmobile! [runs outside, while holding his pants] Awaaaaay!
Barnacle Boy: ...Where'd we park it?!?!
Mermaid Man: Uhh...
SpongeBob: Can I have your autograph, can I have your autograph, can I... they're gone. [gasps] Mermaid Man's belt!
Mermaid Man: Wait! We'll find it with the invisible boat alarm! [he pulls it out, and makes as to press a button. A car flickers in and out of visibility thrice, making beeps as well] There she is! [they run over and jump in the car. Barnacle Boy hits the seat divider]
Barnacle Boy: Owwww! [rubs his behind] ...I told you we should have got the automatic.
SpongeBob: HEY, GUYS. WAIT UP. [pulling out Mermaid Man's belt; slow motion] I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOOOOOU...
Barnacle Boy: Floor it! [both speed off in the boat]
SpongeBob: You forgot your belt! You forgot— [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive away] Mermaid Man's secret utility belt. The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations!... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it. [makes one step in the boat's direction... then sprints back to the kitchen with the belt on] Or not. [giggles] I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does. [presses the belt, and a pickle barrel shrinks] Whooooa. [grabs the shrunken barrel] The small ray! Eeeee!!! [he giggles and smiles mischievously]
Squidward: Here's your shake, sir. [he starts to hand him the shake, but he is startled by a loud noise from the kitchen and SpongeBob's giggle, causing him to accidentally drop the shake on the guy's head. The guy punches Squidward in the face and storms out. There are more flashes, noises and giggles from the kitchen. Squidward gets up and he holds his head] Grr.
SpongeBob: [Hands a tiny Krabby Patty to a cockroach] There you go. Come again, sir. [Squidward barges in] 
Squidward: SpongeBob. What's going on in here? Huh? [SpongeBob wears a tiny hat and holds a tiny spatula, and a cockroach is eating a Krabby Patty while sitting on a shrunken dining table] Why's everything all tiny?
SpongeBob: [turns the belt around to hide it from Squidward] I don't know.
Squidward: What do you got there?
SpongeBob: Nothing.
Squidward: No, really?
SpongeBob: Nothing.
Squidward: You've got something, alright. Let's see it. [Squidward grabs SpongeBob and sees Mermaid Man's belt]
SpongeBob: No, no!
Squidward: [gasps] Is that Mermaid Man's belt?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Squidward: Wow. I can't believe he'd lend it to you.
SpongeBob: Me, uh... either. [chuckles nervously]
Squidward: [gasps] He didn't lend it to you, did he?
SpongeBob: Please don't tell!
Squidward: [angry] You stole it!
SpongeBob: Please don't tell!
Squidward: Oh, I'm telling.
SpongeBob: Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!
Squidward: Uh-oh! [points at the phone hanging on the kitchen wall] There's the phone.
SpongeBob: Don't!
Squidward: I'm walking towards the phone! [slowly walks towards phone]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: [slowly reaches for the phone] I'm getting closer to the phone.
SpongeBob: [sobbing] Do-o-o-n't!
Squidward: [picks up the phone, ready to call Mermaid Man] And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for.
SpongeBob: [wails and tears himself] I'm begging you!!
Squidward: Hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid... [SpongeBob shrinks Squidward.  He lands on the table] What the? What? [phones hits Squidward on the head] Ow!
Mermaid Man:  [on phone] Hello? Hello?
Squidward: What did you do to me?!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!
Squidward: SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size RIGHT NOW, you are gonna be in really big trouble!
SpongeBob: Uh... uh, okay, uh...
Squidward: I said now!
SpongeBob: Uh... [belt is shown to have several complicated buttons] Uh...
Squidward: Do you hear me?! [SpongeBob zaps Squidward and he appears with multiple eyes with hissing snakes] HOLY FISH PASTE! Get it off me! Get it off me! [takes eyes off him and pants in fear] Don't you know how to work that thing?!
SpongeBob: Uhh, I can do it! [SpongeBob changes Squidward into a burning mess, then changes him to have an enormous nose, then to have no skin, then cut in half by scissors, then changed into more things off-screen while SpongeBob looks in fright. Squidward screams whenever SpongeBob changes him]
Squidward: [looks burnt after SpongeBob’s failed attempts to revert him] Ahh! AHH!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!! Stop! I've got an idea. Let's call Mermaid Man and--
SpongeBob: [snatching Squidward] No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience. [he runs to Patrick's house, where Patrick is sleeping] Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!
Patrick: [wakes up due to surprise] Ehh? Huh? Oh. Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look. [shows Patrick the shrunken Squidward]
Patrick: A Squidward action figure! [grabs Squidward] Let me play with him!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick!
Patrick: Fighter pilot! [imitates jet plane diving, machine gunfire and explosion noises] Dive bomb!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: [about to punch Squidward] And then comes a giant fist!
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident.
Patrick: Oh... [about to punch Squidward anyway] And then comes a giant -- [Squidward screams] 
SpongeBob: [stops Patrick] Wait, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.
Patrick: Oh, don't worry about it. He'll find love one day.
SpongeBob: You think so?
Patrick: Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size. [pulls out a pickle] Like this pickle! See? They like each other!
Squidward: N-n-n-n-no. [Patrick bangs them together as if to kiss. Squidward is disgusted]
SpongeBob: Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!
Patrick: Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You got it set to [points to the M] 'M' for Mini when it should be set to [turns M around] 'W' for Wumbo.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word.
Patrick: Come on! You know... I wumbo, You wumbo, He, she, me... wumbo! Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama... Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!
Squidward: [while Patrick is saying "we'll have the wumbo"] I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.
Patrick: Well, all right, then. Let her rip! [SpongeBob uses Mermaid Man's belt and presses something to try and "regrow" Squidward. Only Patrick and Squidward are both shrunk now] It worked!
SpongeBob: Oh no!
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob's giant! [SpongeBob grabs them] Can I be giant next?
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!
Patrick: You're kidding! [pulls out his pickle] Good thing I still got this pickle! [kisses the pickle three times. Pan over to Squidward]
Squidward: Hey! Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!
SpongeBob: [yells in Squidward's face] No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise. [gets a jar and puts them in] Until then, you'll be safe in this jar.
Patrick: You know what's funny? My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again! Heh. It's like a pun or something! Heheh...
SpongeBob: It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it. [Sandy suddenly appears]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams] Sandy! [shrinks Sandy]
Sandy: [lands on the ground] What did you... For cryin' out... What did y'all do to me?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and... [Larry appears]
Larry: Hey, SpongeBob! [shrinks Larry]
Nat: Hey, SpongeBob, I -- [shrinks Nat]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Hi, SpongeBob. [shrinks Nancy; SpongeBob screams and makes a run for it]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, SpongeBob. [shrinks Mrs. Puff]
Scooter: Sponge-dude! [shrinks Scooter, Sandals, and Dennis]
Fish #1: Hey, SpongeBob! [shrinks fish]
Fish #2: SpongeBob, hi! [shrinks fish]
Fish #3: Hey, SpongeBob! [shrinks fish]
Fish #4: What's up, Sponge? [shrinks fish]
SpongeBob: [tries to fit everyone in the jar] Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you just face facts? You've shrunken everybody in Bikini Bottom! You've got to go to Mermaid Man!
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.
Sandy: Well, you can't leave us small forever!
SpongeBob: You don't understand! [SpongeBob's mother is seen in the jar]
Mrs. SquarePants: [gently and soothingly] SpongeBob. You need to admit your mistakes.
SpongeBob: Mom?
Mermaid Man: Your mother's right, son. Mermaid Man will understand.
Barnacle Boy: You're Mermaid Man, you old coot!
Mermaid Man: Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and...
Mermaid Man: [comforting SpongeBob] Oh, don't worry, son. I understand. [SpongeBob smiles, with tears still pooling in his eyes] Why, I remember back when I first used the belt, the year was nineteen ought eleventy-twelve, why I believe the president—
Everyone: Just tell him how to unshrink us!!!!!
Mermaid Man: Oh, yes. The unshrink ray... let's see, uh — uh... did you set it to Wumbo?
Everyone: WHAT?!?! [the jar rumbles from anger and everyone flies out of the jar, spells out and form the statement...] GET SPONGEBOB!! [climbs up SpongeBob's body and into the holes in his head]
Squidward: Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom... in my own home! [kicks SpongeBob's stomach]
Sandy: And I need an elevator to climb one stair! HI-YA! [punches his brain]
Mermaid Man: We've been shrinking for years!
Barnacle Boy: But this is ridiculous! [both kick his eyeballs. Dale kicks his pelvis, Nancy chops off one of his lungs while hanging on to his spine, Larry kicks his knee. SpongeBob is shown getting hurt from the outside]
Everyone: Everything's too big!!!!!
SpongeBob: I've got it! [Squidward saws a blood vein and Frank tries to break a bone, but stop when SpongeBob shrinks the city] Ta-da! [everyone looks outside through his holes] Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small! [everybody leaves SpongeBob's body] And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese! [turns the shrink ray into W and towards him like a camera and shrinks himself]
Squidward: I guess this is okay.
Larry: Yeah, what's the difference?
Nancy: Good idea, SpongeBob. [everyone cheers, balloons and other party items are flying, as a bus comes back and Plankton gets off of it]
Plankton: Well, it's great to be back! [notices small Bikini Bottom] Huh?



Narrator: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [we see a long line to the Krusty Krab] In a familiar restaurant, in a familiar part of town, a call goes out in frustration.
Frank: Will you hurry up?
Narrator: A call that would normally be answered by Bikini Bottom's semi-retired champions. If they weren't the ones causing the problem.
Mermaid Man: Let's see... I want a... no. [Shows a brief shot of Krusty Krab Menu] I want a... [camera returns to Mermaid Man] uh, no, uh, hmmm...
Squidward: Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!
SpongeBob: [whispering in Mermaid Man's ear] Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.
Mermaid Man: I've made my decision!
Line of Customers: Hooray!
Mermaid Man: One Krabby Patty for me and a Pipsqueak Patty for the boy.
Barnacle Boy: Now, wait just a darn minute!
Line of Customers: Awww!
Barnacle Boy: I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty! I want an adult size Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.
Barnacle Boy: Don't you see what you're doing? You're treating me like a child!
Mr. Krabs: The boy’s eyes are bigger than his stomach. [laughs]
Barnacle Boy: And that's another thing, I'm not a boy! I'm so old I got hairs growing out of the wrinkles in my liver spots. [shows a hair popping out]
Squidward: [snickering] One Pipsqueak patty [close up of the patty] and your bib and highchair.
Barnacle Boy: I'm 68 years old and I want a Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: Your Pipsqueak is getting cold. Shall I feed you?
Barnacle Boy: Feed this, old man! [slaps the Krabby Patty out of Mermaid Man's hand]
All except MM and BB:  Ooooooooh.
Barnacle Boy: I'm tired of playing second banana to a man who wears a bra! From now on, I want to be called Barnacle Man! And, I'm through protecting citizens that don't respect me!
SpongeBob: I respect you, Barnacle Man!

Barnacle Man: That's Barnacle Boy, I mean, Man! I... Ohh... forget you people. I say if you're not going to give me the respect I want as a hero, then maybe you'll give me respect as a villain. A villain who is... evil!

SpongeBob: Evil?
Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Sandy &amp; Patrick: Evil? [Mermaid Man does nothing but smile, so Mr. Krabs slaps him]
Mermaid Man: Evil!
Barnacle Man: I'm crossing over... to the dark side! [points to dark side of Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Why should I waste money lighting the whole store? [villain car comes in, shows brief shot of License Plate (MEAN 2 U), then the window opens revealing Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble in the car]
Dirty Bubble: Did someone say evil?
SpongeBob: Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble! [BB gets in villain car]
Barnacle Man: Nighty night, you old goat!
Mermaid Man: Nighty-night! [to Squidward] Will you tuck me in?
Realistic Fish Head: We interrupt your bleak and meaningless lives for this news report. [Man Ray zaps a building] Man Ray, [Dirty Bubble grabs a local bank while snickering] the Dirty Bubble, and now, playing for the dark side, Barnacle Boy...
Barnacle Man: Barnacle Man!
Realistic Fish Head: ...have been committing a series of crimes throughout Bikini Bottom. [shows Man Ray, the Dirty Bubble, and Barnacle Man ding-dong-ditching]
Barnacle Man: Shh! [rings the doorbell and run off, while laughing]
Senior Citizen: [opens door] I'll get you crazy kids!
Realistic Fish Head: These three have named their new alliance: Every Villain Is Lemons, otherwise known as E.V.I.L.! What can we do? When will this crime wave end? How will we defeat the evil? Why am I asking you all these questions? Mermaid Man, where are you? [Mermaid Man does nothing but smile again, so Mr. Krabs slaps him again]
Mermaid Man: Huh? I'm right here! Don't worry, good citizens! Nothing will stop me from defeating the E.V.I.L.! [runs outside] Nothing! [ice cream truck sounds] Ice cream? I love ice cream! A double scoop of prune with bran sprinkles. [he receives an ice cream with a lit fuse] Mmm. [MM licks it and takes a big bite but explodes, "KA-BRAN!" appears, leaving a hole in his stomach] Goes right through me every time.
Barnacle Man: [E.V.I.L. is shown as ice cream men] You might as well give up, Mermaid Man, because there are three of us and only one of you. You don't stand a chance. [drives off]
SpongeBob: [runs to Mermaid Man with Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward] Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?
Mermaid Man: You're right. [sits down] I give up.
SpongeBob: You can't give up. What if we help you?
Mermaid Man: No, no, that's a terrible idea. But what if you help me?
SpongeBob: Okay!
Mermaid Man: Who wants to save the world?
SpongeBob: I do!
Sandy: I do!
Patrick: I do!
Squidward: I don't.

Mr. Krabs: [confronts Squidward] Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired! [runs back to the Krusty Krab; Squidward grumbles]

Mermaid Man: Then it's settled! To the Mermalair! [Transition to the Mermalair]
SpongeBob: Wow! The Mermalair!
Mermaid Man: These costumes belonged to the original International Justice League of Super Acquaintances!
SpongeBob: Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too.
Mermaid Man: Once you put on these costumes, their fantastic powers will become yours!
Sandy: Wow! I didn't think super powers worked that way.
Mermaid Man: Sure! Power's all in the costume! Why else would we run around in colored undies?
Squidward: I can think of three good reasons.
Narrator: [SpongeBob is running at lightning fast speed in his costume] The Quickster...with the uncanny ability to run really...quick!
SpongeBob: Want to see me run to that mountain and back? [doesn't move] You want to see me do it again?
Narrator: [Squidward is wearing his costume] Captain Magma...get him angry and he's bound to erupt!
Squidward: Krakatoa! [lava shoots out, licks his hand, then puts his thumb on his rear, while making a sizzling sound]
Narrator: The Elastic Waistband...able to stretch his body into fantastic shapes and forms! [Patrick, in his costume, stretches his whole body really long]
Patrick: I can finally touch my toes! [stretches his toes over the back of his body and to his hands]
Narrator: And Miss Appear...now you see her... [Sandy disappears in her costume] ...now you don't.
Sandy: Does this outfit make me look fat?
Narrator: The International Justice League of Super Acquaintances! A subsidiary of Viacom.
Mermaid Man: So, it's agreed. We'll get one cheese pizza, one with pepperoni and mushrooms, and one with olives.
Chief: Super Acquaintances, we need your help.
SpongeBob: Holy halibut! It's the chief!
Chief: Thank you for the introduction, Quickster, but we all know who I am! More importantly, we've found information on the whereabouts of E.V.I.L.
Patrick: The whose-abouts of what?
Sandy: You just tell us where they are, Chief, and we'll hog-tie 'em faster than you can say "Salsa Verde."
Chief: Our sources last found E.V.I.L. harassing teenagers up at "Make-Out Reef." You know, Make-Out Reef? [makes out with himself] Whoo hoo hoo!
SpongeBob: Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!
Mermaid Man: Those fiends! Attacking hormonally stressed-out children!
Squidward: Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times.
Mermaid Man: To Make-Out Reef, [chair falls backwards] away!
Patrick: Does this mean we're not getting pizza? [scene cuts to Make-Out Reef at night]
John &amp; Nancy: Stop, please!
E.V.I.L.: John and Nancy, sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!
Dirty Bubble: Oh! [points at a car] Shine the flashlight in that car, Man Ray!
Man Ray: Haha, with pleasure! [shines on a guy making out with a pillow]
Sandals: Hey man, that's not cool. [E.V.I.L. snickers until Mermaid Man appears]
Mermaid Man: Leave those young lovers alone!
Man Ray: Well, if it isn't Milk Maid Man! You've saved us the trouble of tracking you down!
Mermaid Man: You fiends can't win! You're outnumbered!
Man Ray: You senile bag of fish paste! There are three of us and only one of you!
SpongeBob: [runs up at super fast speed from behind and stops next to Mermaid Man] Make that two!
Man Ray: The Quickster!
Squidward: [blasts up and flies like a rocket over the villains and joins the two heroes] Three!
Barnacle Man: Captain Magma!
Patrick: [stretches far from behind and joins the three heroes] Four!
Dirty Bubble: The Elastic Waistband!
Sandy: [appears next to the group of heroes] Five!
E.V.I.L.: M-M-Miss Appear!
Mermaid Man: And me makes ten, I think.
Man Ray: Uh-oh.
Dirty Bubble: I don't have a good feeling about this.
Barnacle Man: Oh, there goes our toy deal.
Mermaid Man: Super Acquaintances, attack!
Barnacle Man: Oh no, please, mercy!
Squidward: Krakatoa! [lava shoots out onto The Quickster]
SpongeBob: Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off! [starts running in a circle fast] Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!
Patrick: I'll save you, Quickster! [stretches his arms to try and save Quickster, but ends up getting caught, and flies out with his arms overstretched. The villains look at each other in confusion]
Mermaid Man: I'll cool you off, Quickster, with one of my water balls! [creates a water ball with his hands and concentrates, but targets Captain Magma instead] Aha!
Squidward: Huh?! No, no, no, I'm not the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag... [gets hit by the water ball] ma... [coughs, then melts to pile of ash]
Sandy: Well, I guess it's up to me! [turns invisible and only her footprints show in the ground] I'll sneak over...unseen...and catch them by surprise. [a boat hits her, sending her through the sign and to the cliff, while still invisible] Aaaaaah! [land on the ground]
SpongeBob: Get it off! Get it off! [eventually stops, but only shown as shoes] Whew...glad that's over!
[villains look at fallen heroes and Mermaid Man falls backwards]
Barnacle Man: We did it, we won! This day belongs to E.V.I.L.! [approaches the fallen Mermaid Man] You've lost Mermaid Man, and the superhero and super-villain rules say you have to give in to my demands.
Mermaid Man: Okay, what do you want?
Man Ray: World domination! Tell him we want world domination!
Dirty Bubble: And make him eat dirt! Hahaha! [Man Ray stares at him] In addition to the...domination thing.
Barnacle Man: Number one, I want to be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick. Number two, I want to be called Barnacle Man. And number three...
Man Ray: Come on, world domination!
Barnacle Man: I want an adult-sized Krabby Patty.
Dirty Bubble: [he and Man Ray are shocked] Did you hear him say anything about eating dirt?
Barnacle Man: Need a hand, superpal? [both start to get tears in their eyes as they grab and shake hands. "FRIEND!" appears]
Mermaid Man: Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle. Let's go get you that Krabby Patty! [leaves with Barnacle Boy]
Man Ray: Was that it? [groans in disgust] That's sickening!
Dirty Bubble: Oh, this reminds me of the time I went to Cancun with a killer shrimp. Oh, they had these papaya drinks that were to die for!
Man Ray: [while Dirty Bubble is talking] Oh, Neptune, shut up! [at the Krusty Krab. Barnacle Boy is eating an adult-sized Krabby Patty]
Mermaid Man: How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle [winks] Man?
Barnacle Man: Actually, it's pretty big. I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing. [Mermaid Man laughs, then Barnacle Boy laughs, SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward come in, all injured and laughing, the guy at make-out reef who was kissing the pillow is laughing, Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble are in jail, laughing, and the chief is making out with himself, he turns around and laughs hysterically]


[A green car comes driving up and stops. Kelp Thing gets out.]
[Mermaid Man is shown on a building.]
Kelp Thing: Huh? Eh?
Narrator: It's Mermaid Man! Savior of the deep! [Barnacle Boy comes in] And his young fit servant, Barnacle Boy.
Mermaid Man: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy...unite! [both put rings together, then jump down onto Kelp Thing's car] Kelp Thing, this is a posted, no-parking zone.
Kelp Thing: But I must do what I do. [jumps up in the air until he notices his car is being towed] Huh? [The word "TOWED" comes on screen. Kelp Thing jumps down and then walks away]
Mermaid Man: Evil can't park here between the hours of 6:00am and 12:00pm! [the word "FIN" appears on-screen. The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club is watching a video about the heroes. They cheer]
Club Leader: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club members unite! [puts hands together in air]
All: Unite!
Club Leader: And now the second order of business: Drippy Brothers Studios is currently in production of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie!
All: Ooh!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy, Patrick, I can hardly wait to see our favorite heroes on the big screen!
[Patrick laughs]
Club Leader: Third order of business, the special surprise guest! [all gasp] The stars of the Mermaid Man movie are here tonight! [everyone cheers] Directly from the set, here they are! [curtain opens, revealing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy actors]
Fake Mermaid Man: Hello, little heroes.
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: You're not Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. You're fakes!
Fake Mermaid Man: Well, of course, we are. We're actors.
SpongeBob: Actors? How can they make a Mermaid Man movie without the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Fake Mermaid Man: Listen, kid, this is an action movie. Your has-been heroes are too OLD for action.
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man is timeless!
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: I think I speak for everyone here when I say we won't stand for these two phony-baloneys ruining the good name of our heroes. No right-minded Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy society member would ever pay to see this... this celluloid hoax. I say we boycott this movie! Now who's with me? [SpongeBob and Patrick are thrown out of the building] Traitors! Wait ‘til we tell Mermaid Man about this. [cut to the retirement home]
Announcer: B-47.
Mermaid Man: BONKO!
Barnacle Boy: [puts his hands on Mermaid Man] It's "bingo".
Mermaid Man: [slaps Barnacle Boy's hand away] Get your hands off me, woman!
Announcer: A-29.
SpongeBob: [walks in angrily] Too old for an action movie...huh.
Barnacle Boy: What is it this time, kid?
SpongeBob: Are you aware Drippy Brothers Studio is making the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie?
Barnacle Boy: They can't be making a movie about us!
SpongeBob: But they are! And they're using... [close-up of SpongeBob's mouth] actors.
[The heroes gasp.]
SpongeBob: They have shunned our heroes.
Patrick: And they weren't nice to them either.
Mermaid Man: [sobs] Now our dreams of being big screen heroes will never come true.
SpongeBob: Well, that makes it even worse.
Barnacle Boy: [Puts his hands on Mermaid Man's back] You bet it does, kid.
Mermaid Man: And the worst part is I can't remember why I started crying. [sobs some more]
Patrick: Why don't we just make our own movie?
SpongeBob: Patrick, once again, you have exposed your brilliance. We'll make a real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie. Right here at Shady Shoals.
Mermaid Man: [stops crying] You will?
SpongeBob: Yes! And in doing so, we will right the wrong done to you by the evil Drippy Brother Studios and... [close-up of SpongeBob's mouth] their actors.
Mermaid Man: [jumps on top of the table] Vindication is ours! Vindi... how did I get up here? [cut to Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?
Patrick: Popcorn?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, to start making a movie.
Patrick: Oh, oh, oh...
SpongeBob: Let's start with...the title.
Patrick: Yeah, yeah. Ooh! I got one! "Adventures in the Underground City".
SpongeBob: Great, Pat, what happens?
Patrick: Well, there's a city...
SpongeBob: [typing on a typewriter] City...
Patrick: And it's underground...
SpongeBob: [typing] Underground...
Patrick: And they have an adventure...
SpongeBob: [still typing] Adventure...
Patrick: The end.
SpongeBob: End. [stops typing] That's great, Pat. [checks paper] Hmm, seems kinda short.
Patrick: I have an idea. Let's make it longer!
SpongeBob: Longer, yes. Okay, let's have Mermaid Man get his face... [shrinks his face] ...shrunk by Kelp-Thing's face minimizer.
Patrick: Yeah, and then he...umm...he drinks...cheese coffee.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Good one, Pat. [both laugh]
Mr. Krabs: [walks to table] What are ye lads doing?
SpongeBob: We're making a movie.
Mr. Krabs: Great! I got cinema's newest star, right here.
SpongeBob: [looks through his fingers, which make a square shape staring at Pearl. She giggles and holds a Krabby Patty on a tray in her fin]
Mr. Krabs: So, what do ye say, lad?
SpongeBob: Sure, Mr. Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie.
Mr. Krabs: I wasn't talking about Pearl. I was talking about the Krabby Patty.
[Pearl looks at the Krabby Patty and starts crying massive tears]
SpongeBob: You can be in it, too, Pearl.
Pearl: [stops crying] I'm gonna be a movie star. [cut to outside Shady Shoals]
SpongeBob: Let's meet the highly skilled professionals who will help us fulfill your dream of being on the big screen. Sandy will handle the stunts and explosives. [Sandy holds up a bomb]
Sandy: Howdy.
SpongeBob: Pearl is the leading lady. Mr Krabs will cater the affair. [Mr. Krabs holds up a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Patrick will run the camera.
Patrick: Hey... [knocks over the camera and gets tangled up in roll]
SpongeBob: This is Squidward. He's in charge of the makeup department.
Squidward: [walks away] Uh, no thanks. Who wants to be the 'makeup department'?
SpongeBob: Not makeup department, you're the makeup 'artist'.
Squidward: [looks back] Artist?
SpongeBob: Makeup artist.
Squidward: In that case, let's make those old crabapples sizzle. [looks at the heroes] Hmmm... [close-ups of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's old, wrinkly faces] Time for the art-eest to go to work. [takes out the flamethrower and gets to work. Banging and screaming are heard. Squidward staples their faces together] Voila!
SpongeBob: Okay, places everybody. Squidward, are our heroes ready?
Squidward: As they'll ever be.
SpongeBob: [gasps. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are tied up and look like sausage links] They're beautiful! They look just like they did 30 years ago. [Mermaid Man slurping] Okay, action!
[explosion]
Sandy: I love my new job!
SpongeBob: Good job, Sandy!
Plankton: Psst... [has a mini Man Ray head on] I, Man Ray, have returned from the murky depths to seek my revenge and banish your souls to the nether regions. Their defenses are strong, but they are no match for my Man Ray ray. [takes out a flashlight and turns it on]
SpongeBob: What are you doing?
Plankton: SpongeBob, this role was made for me.
SpongeBob: That villain isn't even in this movie. But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications. Oh, here's something. [takes microphone stand] You can be the boom operator!
Plankton: I thought Sandy was the boom operator!
Sandy: Did somebody say boom?
[explosion]
Plankton: All right, SpongeBob, but you're squandering my talents!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, start the movie!
Assistant: Take 1.
Mermaid Man: We have to get back to those swollen Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's "stolen Krabby Patties."
Assistant: Take 2.
Mermaid Man: We have to get back to those stolen naggie daddies.
SpongeBob: Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's "stolen Krabby Patties!"
Assistant: [somewhat tired tone] Take 5,003.
Mermaid Man: We have to get back to those stolen Krabby Patties! And if we don't stop that diabolical scoundrel- [mumbles because Plankton accidentally shoves the microphone in his mouth]
Plankton: Give it back!
Barnacle Boy: I knew this was a bad idea.
SpongeBob: Cut! Plankton, next time could you keep the boom out of shot? Other than that, you're doing a super job.
Plankton: This is humiliating. I'm not good at this boom thing.
Sandy: Did somebody say boom?
[explosion]
Pearl: Oh, daddy, you said I was going to be a star!
Mr. Krabs: You are, Pearl. Mermaid Man wouldn't be anywhere without you. Go out there and break a leg.
Pearl: Yeah! [runs off and cut to steep mountain]
SpongeBob: Okay, action!
Mermaid Man: To the boat mobile. [both jump on the boat mobile, which is really Pearl on her back with wheels]
SpongeBob: Cue the sound effects. [Pearl uses her tongue for a boat engine]
Mermaid Man: Listen to that engine purr. [the assistant is straining as he tries to pull Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and Pearl up a steep cliff]
SpongeBob: Almost there! [the assistant grabs the edge of the cliff, but it breaks off causing them to slide down, over a curved slope and into the air. Patrick aims the camera so that it's directly on Pearl, the assistant, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Then they come crashing down onto the set. Pearl gets off of a flattened SpongeBob]
Patrick: Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Everything's ruined! Well, at least we got the footage.
Patrick: Yeah, I got the footage.
SpongeBob: Patrick, what is that?
Patrick: Oh, it's a camera.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, this. [takes off lens cap]
Patrick: Oh, that's a lens cap.
SpongeBob: Did you just put that on?!
Patrick: Yup, I didn't want to lose it, so I put it there right before we started filming.
[SpongeBob screams and goes insane, scoots his butt on the ground, lifts up piece of ground, and eats worms on bottom side. Everyone gasps.]
SpongeBob: [sobbing] The movie's ruined! We can't make a movie!
Mermaid Man: Hey, little hero, this reminds me of the Episode 912. We were surrounded. The Kelp-Thing was to our right and their broccoli was on the side. But if there was one thing I remember, it was how to forget.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is good. Roll the film.
Mermaid Man: The rain in Spain stays mainly on the...space! The final countdown. Stick to the...stick to the...Lou, my darling! Lou! [falls on ground] Now get out there and finish this movie, kid. [cut to the Krusty Krab at night. Mr. Krabs is weeping]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, why are you weeping?
Mr. Krabs: I closed early for your movie. Where are the paying customers?! You promised a full house!
SpongeBob: And here comes the filling! [fan club comes rushing into the Krusty Krab] The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club. I knew you'd come to see the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie.
Club Leader: Actually, the real movie was sold out. I'll take 200 tickets, please. [hands Mr. Krabs stack of money and he stuffs it into his pocket]
Mr. Krabs: Now, this is what I call a happy ending.
Barnacle Boy: [movie starts] Well, our big moment, us up on the big screen. [Mermaid Man is sleeping]
SpongeBob: [on-screen, playing with a toy car near a box-made fort with the word "LOX" on it] Fort Lox: home to over five billion Krabby Patties. [SpongeBob and Patrick each grab a canister of popcorn while watching the movie. SpongeBob uses his tongue and Patrick sucks all the popcorn out of his canister] What evil mastermind would dare infiltrate this fortified fort and make off with its treasure? [the patty vault is opened and a piece of kelp on strings comes down] It is I, Kelp-Thing! Do what I do!
Mermaid Man: [on-screen] Stop! You can't do that forbidden.
SpongeBob: [on-screen as Kelp-Thing] Watch me!
Mermaid Man: Prepare to feel my wrath, you foul villain. [Sandy comes in as Mermaid Man's stunt double and fights Kelp Thing. Then Mermaid Man shows up on screen again] You may have won the Krabby Patties, but the battle rages on. [real crabs are fighting] Mermaidmanacle Boy, unite! [both put rings together. Then 'FIN' comes on-screen]

​

SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [cheering] Yay! [the other Bikini Bottomites are disappointed]
Mermaid Man: Well, kid, you showed the world that even though our steps may have been slowed, we still have a little action left in these heroic old bones. [bone breaks]
Barnacle Boy: Well, at least some of them. [all four of them laugh]


[Mr. Krabs wakes up in his hammock in his bedroom. The radio clicks on]
Radio DJ: You've got it tuned to K-O-L-D, K-Old, your all-oldies station. Here's a little something you may remember from the good old days.
♪You're old... Groaning like a geezer♪ [Mr. Krabs opens his eyes, which are crusty and coated in barnacles] ♪Feel yourself a-crackin' like an old has-been♪ [Mr. Krabs gets out of bed with all his joints cracking when he moves] ♪Look at yourself, old man, you've got multiple chins♪ [Mr. Krabs looks in his bathroom mirror. He pulls down his shirt to show a bunch of chins] ♪'Cause you're old...♪ [scene cuts to the kitchen. Mr. Krabs sits down at the table as Pearl comes in]
Pearl Krabs: Good morning, Daddy. [gives him a kiss] I made you breakfast.
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, sweet pea. I see you got creative with the bran today. [looks down at the plate to see his bran shaped as bacon, eggs, juice, and others]
Pearl: Open up, it's time for the pill. [Pearl takes out a giant pill]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill. [Pearl shoves the giant pill in his mouth and he swallows it] Pearl, do you think I'm... old?
Pearl: Well, of course I do! But that's okay. Daddies are supposed to be old.
Mr. Krabs: But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?
Pearl: See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old-person thing. Now we say "coral," as in, "That nose job is so coral."
Mr. Krabs: Coral, eh?
Pearl: Eww, when you say it, it sounds so uncoral.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-ral.
Pearl: Don't you have to go to work or something, Dad?
Mr. Krabs: Whoop, you're right! [eats his breakfast] Have a coral day, honey.
Pearl: [picks up her phone and dials] Jenny? It's Pearl. "Coral" is definitely out. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs walking outside]
Mr. Krabs: Ha! Old? What was I thinkin'? I ain't old. Huh? [turns around to see a boy helping him walk across]
Boy Scout: Don't worry, Pops, we're almost across the street.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, get away from me. I don't need no snot-nosed little... [as he walks away, his arm comes off. Walks back to get it] Sorry you had to see that. [keeps walking to work where a fish is walking behind him]
Harold: Come on, move it! Could you be any slower? And you've had your blinker on for the last five blocks. [Mr. Krabs turns around and notices he has two signals on his behind, the right arrow is blinking, so he covers his behind. He continues to walk until a ball rolls next to him]
Tyler: Hey, mister, could you throw the ball back over here?
Mr. Krabs: [picks up the ball] Hey, how's about I join you kids?
Tyler: Uhh, that's okay. You can keep it. Why do old people always have to ruin the fun? [Mr. Krabs drops the ball. He walks up to a line of elderly fish]
Elderly Fish #1: Hey, no cuttin'! You gotta wait your turn in line like everybody else! [Mr. Krabs notices a long line in front of the Bikini Bottom Cemetery]
Mr. Krabs: No! No! I ain't old like you! I ain't old! I ain't old! [runs away]
Elderly Fish #2: What's his problem? [the line is for ice cream]
Lou: Next? [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is sitting a table depressed]
Timmy: Mommy, my Krabby Patty tastes funny.
Mother: Well, no wonder. It's all old and dried out. Like that man right there. [points to Mr. Krabs] Now put that thing where it belongs... in the garbage.
Timmy: ♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la...♪ [Timmy walks up to the trashcan, but Mr. Krabs grabs his patty before he can get there]
Mr. Krabs: Well, little patty, we're two of a kind. We've both lost our luster. [takes a bite out of the patty] Hmmm, so that's what I taste like.
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew! [SpongeBob pokes his head out of the kitchen window]
SpongeBob: [shouts] Hey, Patrick! You all ready for the big night out tonight?
Patrick: [shouts] Yeah, it's gonna rock!
SpongeBob: Are you ready to go crazy?
Patrick: I'm already hearing voices!
SpongeBob: Are you ready to—
Squidward: SpongeBob! Patrick! Do you mind?!
SpongeBob: Let's continue this conversation in private, Patrick. I think some people are eavesdropping!
Patrick: Well, how rude of some people!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, those youngsters are goin’ out for a big night on the town. [stretches his eyes into the kitchen where SpongeBob and Patrick are talking]
SpongeBob: Whoo! I've been lookin’ forward to this night all week!
Patrick: Party!
SpongeBob: What do you think we should do first?
Patrick: What shouldn't we do first? We're young, [Mr. Krabs' eyes move a little closer] we've got wheels, [Mr. Krabs' eyes move closer] the world is our oyster! SpongeBob, you got something on your shoulder. [SpongeBob notices Mr. Krabs' eyes are on his shoulders]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boys, hangin' out?
Patrick: [looks at his large belly] Yes.
Mr. Krabs: I couldn't help overhearin’ your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?
SpongeBob: Of course. Did you wanna come with us, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hadn't even crossed me mind. But, sure, I'll go!
Patrick: I don't know, SpongeBob. He might cramp our style.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [appear in a picture with a goofy look on them] Style!
Patrick: Let's see if he knows the secret cool-guy handshake. [holds out his hand]
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, yeah, course I know it! [begins to sweat] Uhh... uhh...
Patrick: I'm waiting... old man.
Mr. Krabs: [shakes Patrick's hand] Uhh... how do you do?
Patrick: Fine, and you? All right, you're in. But I'm not happy about it.
SpongeBob: You passed the test, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Great! Why don't you boys show up at my house at eight o'clock?
SpongeBob: I just wanna warn you, Mr. Krabs. We're always fashionably late.
French Narrator: 8:01 PM. [scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' house. The doorbell rings]
SpongeBob: Hey there, Mr. Krabs! Are you ready to party?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party?
Patrick: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, Patrick?
Patrick: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready to party! Are you ready to par- [Pearl runs by them]
Pearl: Stop it, just stop it! You're embarrassing me, Dad! [sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: So, what kind of hot rod will we be cruisin’ in tonight?
SpongeBob: Only the most powerful chick magnet in town. The Underwater Heartbreaker. [we see a bike with two streamers on each handle]
Mr. Krabs: It's more like a chick repellent. And there's only two seats.
SpongeBob: Calm your waters, Mr. Krabs. I modified this little baby myself. [scene cuts to SpongeBob &amp; Patrick riding at the front of the bike, while Mr. Krabs is in a wagon behind them]
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure this is what the kids are drivin’ these days?
SpongeBob: Only the cool kids. [a hot rod, driven by a young teen, pulls up beside them]
Hot rod fish: Hey, you guys must be lost. Doofus Drive is around the corner!
SpongeBob: We're not lost, I've got my compass. [shows him the compass]
Hot rod fish: So long, dorks! [speeds away]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, pals!
Mr. Krabs: We used to beat people up for sayin’ things like that! Everything's all topsy-turvy now. [they pull up to 'The Wash']
SpongeBob: Here we are: The Wash.
Mr. Krabs: They sure are giving these clubs some crazy names! I have to tell you boys... I'm a little nervous. I haven't been, you know, on the scene for quite a while now.
SpongeBob: Just follow our lead, Mr. Krabs. And, above all, keep it cool.
Mr. Krabs: Cool. Gotcha. [SpongeBob and Patrick walk away jumping up and down in a goofy way. Mr. Krabs does the same]
SpongeBob: [opens door] Hello, gang! SpongeBob's back!
Patrick: Let's party!
Mr. Krabs: Any port in the store—! Wait a minute...this is a Laundromat. [scene shows the entire room is a place to do your laundry]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [all three looking at their reflections in the washer] Oh yeah, whoo! That's what I'm talkin’ about. Oh, yeah! Yeah, the colors! whoo! [washer stops]
SpongeBob: You guys want another rinse cycle? I'm buyin’.
Mr. Krabs: You know, I love staring at delicates as much as the next guy, but it's just that I thought we'd see more of the nightlife. Somethin’ that'll give you that wild and crazy hot-blooded feelin’, if you know what I mean.
SpongeBob: Oh, I know what you mean, Mr. Krabs. This is only stop numero uno on our night of debauchery!
Patrick: Debauchery!
Mr. Krabs: Debauchery! [scene cuts to the road where all three are picking up trash] Debauchery? I never thought of picking up trash under the highway as hot-blooded, but if it's what the kids are into...
SpongeBob: So, are you feeling that wild and crazy feeling, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Not yet.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, you will. [scene cuts to all three in a kiddie swimming pool] Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'm feeling a warm spot.
Patrick: Sorry. [scene cuts to them riding kiddie rides outside Barg'n Mart]
SpongeBob: Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? Are you feeling it?
Patrick: I'm feeling it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Patrick, that's not a ride. [Patrick is riding on Harold's back]
Harold: Get off of me! [scene cuts to them getting their teeth pulled]
SpongeBob: Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [scene cuts to them redoing a roof] Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [scene cuts to them dressed in costumes playing Dungeons and Dragons] Art thou feeling it now, Mr. Krabs? [scene cuts to the library] You're feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?
Miss Shell: [pops out] Shhh! [scene cuts to a place called "Bunny Buns," an area for kids to play in]
SpongeBob: How about now? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? [kids in the room around running around Mr. Krabs, hanging on his hat streamers. Mr. Krabs has clown make-up on his face]
Kids: Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs? Can you feel it, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: So, you wanna know if I can feel it?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Do you really wanna know if I can feel it?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah, yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Because I can feel it. You wanna know what I'm feelin'?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yes!
Mr. Krabs: [angry] I'm feelin' like a total barnacle head! [swings the screaming kids around and around then off his hat] You think this is cool?! [jumps on a bunny and punches its head off] How about this! [jumps on top of the bunny] And this? Am I with it now? [runs up to SpongeBob and Patrick] You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the end! I'm goin’ home. You guys ain't cool. You're lame!
SpongeBob: [sadly] Lame?!
Mr. Krabs: Lame! You're nerds! Geeks! Creeps! And babies!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Not 'babies!' [both suck their thumbs]
Mr. Krabs: I may be old, but even an old bag of shells like me knows that you haven't suggested one cool thing all night! So good night to ya!
Patrick: I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Mr. Krabs: The what?
Patrick: I said, I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Mr. Krabs: Panty raid? You're talkin’ about girls, right? “Girl” girls?
Patrick: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And you're talkin’ about raidin’ their dressers for their underpants, right?
Patrick: Oh, yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two bein’ lame!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [happy] Not lame! [scene cuts to the three of them carrying a ladder]
Mr. Krabs: Now this is more like it! [lean the ladder against a house]
Patrick: Give us some credit, old man. We're panty professionals! [climbs the ladder]
SpongeBob: We score here all the time. [all three tiptoe into a bedroom. Mr. Krabs opens a drawer and takes out a pair of panties]
Mr. Krabs: Frilly things! We hit the jackpot! [everyone jumps up and down]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [holds up the pair of underwear he got] You finally came through for me, boys! I feel young again! [light turns on]
Mama Krabs: Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Mother?
Mama Krabs: What are you doing with my bloomers?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I, uhh, uhh, heh, [hides his mother's bloomers behind his back] hehe... [turns around to SpongeBob and Patrick] Why didn't you tell me this was my mother's house?!
SpongeBob: Why didn't you ask? [both run away. Mr. Krabs turns around to see his mother angry]
Mr. Krabs: [he giggles nervously then he hides his mother's bloomers behind his back] But it was all SpongeBob and Patrick's idea!
Mama Krabs: Go to your room, mister. You're grounded for the rest of the night!
Mr. Krabs: [walks away] Yes, Mommy. [boy scout from earlier is walking with Mr. Krabs]
Boy Scout: Don't worry, Pops. We're almost to your room. [Mr. Krabs groans. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' bedroom. SpongeBob peeks through the window]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger. [scene zooms out revealing Mr. Krabs is lying on his racecar-shaped bed among a few toys]
SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Good night, SpongeBob.
Mama Krabs: [outside. We see SpongeBob leaving] Eugene, lights out!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, Mommy. [light turns off]


[At a diner, it is raining outside. A man in a hat with a suit and tie is sitting at the bar, looking for his pen. A waitress pours him some coffee into his cup.]
Ted: Oh, no, I lost my pen.
[The Waitress takes a pen out of her hair.]
Waitress: You can borrow mine.
[She hands her pen to Ted.]
Ted: Thanks.
SpongeBob: I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.
Ted: So, anyway, thanks for the pen.
Waitress: No problem, hon.
SpongeBob: [walking on the counter] It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.
[Ted looks at his watch.]
Ted: [Whispers] I've gotta go. [flashback to Monday morning where SpongeBob is sleeping until his alarm goes off]
SpongeBob: [jumps up and throws his blanket in the air] Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. [his blanket lands on his head and he struggles to get it off] Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary! [SpongeBob puts his foot on the floor to feel around for Gary] Gary, are you there? [falls on his face. His alarm falls on his head] Ow! [stands up] Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom? [shrieks as he falls down the staircase. When he falls into the living room, his alarm clock spits him out] Gary? Gary? [hits one of his windows] Gary? [slides off the window]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast? [grabs a can of snail food then sings and dances] The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop! [pours the can into Gary's bowl] Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like. [sticks out his tongue and tastes the snail food but finds it disgusting, sound echoes from his pineapple house] Bleah! [sound echoes through the streets] Bleah! [sound echoes to the Snail Po headquarters] Bleah!
Sadie: What is it, Peterson?
Peterson: I'm not sure. I feel... a disturbance. [cuts back to SpongeBob's house where he is carrying his pants on a hanger]
SpongeBob: That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again. [looks at his watch] Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work. [spins and his pants are on his head] Ooh! [spins and his pants are in his arm] Uh oh. [spins and his pants are in the correct place but the collars are missing] All right! [walks out the door and past Patrick]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi Patrick! [he skips and sings. Scene cuts to the present at the Diner where SpongeBob skips and sings while sitting on a chair]
Waitress: Wait a minute. When exactly did you lose your identity?
Ted: Yeah, and who's Patrick?
Diner Chef: And why did you eat Snail-Po?
SpongeBob: Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab. [cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob opens the door with a food tray in his hand] Order up! [walks to the customer] One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.
Gale: Thanks, uh... [looks closely at his shirt] Oh.
SpongeBob: Is there a problem?
Gale: Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly.
SpongeBob: [laughs] While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here. [points to an empty spot on his shirt where his name tag should be] Huh? [he searches for his name tag then he hyperventilates after he realizes his name tag is missing. Squidward walks up to him]
Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!
Squidward: SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.
SpongeBob: But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it? [SpongeBob imagines a quiet bank and a bank robber bursting in wearing a mask over his head and SpongeBob's name tag]
Bank Robber: Alright! Nobody move! This is a bank robbery! Attica! [cuts back to SpongeBob who screams]
SpongeBob: I'm innocent, I tell ya! [faints then awakens and walks over to Squidward] Squidward, what happened?
Squidward: Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.
SpongeBob: Huh? [hyperventilates again]
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world? [Mr. Krabs comes out of his office]
Mr. Krabs: Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot! [SpongeBob and Squidward stare nervously at Mr. Krabs, who pulls out a big, black boot emitting toxic green fumes] This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour. [Mr. Krabs zips back into his office. SpongeBob starts hyperventilating again]
Squidward: SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.
SpongeBob: Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.
Squidward: [flattered] Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...
SpongeBob: [walks off] Cover me till I get back, okay?
Squidward: Oh, sure, sure. [chuckles] A genius? Well, how about... Hey! [cuts to SpongeBob walking down the road]
SpongeBob: Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning. [walks by Patrick]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi Patrick. [runs back to Patrick] You said hi to me this morning, right?
Patrick: As I do every morning.
SpongeBob: Well, I need you to do it again.
Patrick: That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you talking about?
Patrick: My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps!
Patrick: You lost your name tag? [hyperventilates like SpongeBob does. Scene cuts to SpongeBob poking his head out his window and Patrick standing outside his house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?
Patrick: I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say "hi", just like this morning.
SpongeBob: Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up. [climbs in bed] I sure hope this works. [pretends to go to sleep then jumps up] Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it! [blanket falls on his head which causes him to fall and his alarm clock to fall on him again] So far, so good. [falls down the staircase and lands in his living room. The alarm clock shoots him out] I don't see my name tag up here. [smacks into his window then slides off of it to Gary] Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast? [grabs a can of Snail-Po and sings] The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way. [pours the food into Gary's bowl, then tastes it] Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick. [walks by Patrick, outside, but he doesn't say anything] Patrick!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: You were supposed to say hi to me!
Patrick: Hi. [SpongeBob gets shocked]
SpongeBob: Oh. All right, let's take it from the top. [walks off]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Don't forget your line this time!
Patrick: I won't.
SpongeBob: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. [falls down the staircase, hits the window, and slides to Gary] The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah. [walks by Patrick who, again, says nothing, and SpongeBob growls in anger] Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!
Patrick: What's my motivation?
SpongeBob: [angrily] Forget the motivation! Just say hi! Ugh! [runs off. Cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Cuts again to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry. [laughs. SpongeBob walks off] I'm sorry. Let's try it again. [cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Cuts again to SpongeBob and Patrick] Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai... [laughs] Who's SpongeBoob?! I said SpongeBoob! [SpongeBob walks off] Again, again. Sorry people. [cuts to SpongeBob doing his routine again. Then he is with Patrick, who is trying not to laugh] I've got the giggles.
SpongeBob: Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.
Patrick: Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?

SpongeBob: Hmm, let's see. [imagines what he did today in his thought bubble] I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins... [Old Man Jenkins honks his horn]

Thought SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. J.
SpongeBob: ...placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... [thought ends] and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster. [cuts to SpongeBob being thrown into a dumpster by the Krusty Krab. He laughs] Good one, guys! [tries getting up but slips into the garbage again] Whoa!
Patrick: That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.
Patrick: Well, then we'll look in the dumpster! [cuts to the dumpster outside the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Eh, what is that stench?
Patrick: That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost. [gets on all fours] Hop on, pal.
SpongeBob: [jumps in the dumpster] Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.
Patrick: I wish I had a nose.
SpongeBob: Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.
Patrick: Cannonball! [does a cannonball and jumps to the dumpster. He spits some dirt out and laughs; his teeth are filled with filth]
SpongeBob: You look over there and I'll look over here.
Patrick: Okay. [digs through the trash while throwing some on SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: I'm looking. I'm looking.
SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick!
Patrick: [digs even faster] I'm looking as fast as I can.
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick stops and turns around to see SpongeBob covered in garbage] Thank you. [Patrick pulls trash off of SpongeBob]
Patrick: Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?
SpongeBob: Have you [throws all the garbage away in anger] forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.
Patrick: Could I have another hint?
SpongeBob: [looks at the viewers and blinks twice] Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got [looks at his watch] one minute till inspection. [screams and jumps] One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time. [digs quicker]
Patrick: [notices a name tag on the back of SpongeBob's shirt] Hey, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick.
Patrick: I know where your name tag is. [SpongeBob turns around]
SpongeBob: Where?! Where?!
Patrick: Uh... I can't remember.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't have time for this! [turns back around]
Patrick: There it is!
SpongeBob: [turns around again] Where?!
Patrick: Uh... [SpongeBob becomes angry] I forgot again.
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you with me or against me?
Patrick: Could you give me a hint? [SpongeBob simply turns back around] There! I see it!
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!
Patrick: [turns around, angry] Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.
SpongeBob: My shirt backward... [looks at his clothes] What the...? [bends his head back to his back] My shirt's on backwards! [Patrick looks at him] I had my identity all along. [spins his shirt around and looks at his watch] Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick. [shakes hands with Patrick]
Patrick: [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Don't mention it, buddy. [cuts to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Fall in for inspection! All right, you two... [inspects Squidward] Hat and uniform seem to be in order. [notices a few hairs in Squidward's nose] Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.
Squidward: Hoorah.
Mr. Krabs: [moves to SpongeBob, who is stinky because of the dumpster] Okay, boy, your turn.
SpongeBob: [salutes] I think you'll find everything shipshape.
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs SpongeBob and he covers his nose because he smells bad] Ack! Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?
SpongeBob: Uh... discovery? [Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and sets him outside. Flashback ends and cuts back to the diner] And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story. [Ted yawns while the waitress checks her watch]
Waitress: Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Thanks, uh... [looks at her name tag] Betty.
Waitress: What? [looks down at her name tag] Oh, sweetie, I'm not Betty. I just borrowed her uniform while mine's at the cleaners. [SpongeBob looks at the viewers, confused]


[At the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is in the bathroom, looking at a filthy sink mirror.]
SpongeBob: You're nothing! Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr. Mirror? I've met sardines tougher than you are. Time to put you in your place. [squirts soap on his head and scrubs the mirror clean, then puts work hat on his head from his nose ] Looking good, mirror! Sorry about the harsh words. [gets mop and bucket] Now to attack these floors!
Mr. Krabs: [in his office, on the phone, chuckling] Are you kidding? He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Sounds like Mr. Krabs is bragging about me again to his associates. [turns to reveal an ear on his back]
Mr. Krabs: And he's been with me for such a long time now.
SpongeBob: [chuckles again] I am.
Mr. Krabs: But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today.
SpongeBob: Yep, he's gonna have to--  [notices, shocked] What? Let the little guy go?! Little guy? Who's the little guy? It must be either me, or [gasps] Squidward! [SpongeBob stands behind Squidward, who is sitting down] Phew! I am taller. You're the little guy, Squidsy!
Squidward: [stands up] No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second. Better get a more accurate measurement. [SpongeBob stands right next to Squidward in the workstation]
Squidward: What do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy... [makes himself taller, like a skyscraper] ...and it looks like it is you!
Squidward: No, I'm not! [walks away]
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait! [becomes short again] We haven't measured with my legs at full extension yet! [extends legs]
Squidward: [off-screen] I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!
SpongeBob: You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy. Whoa! [walks off balance, then falls and breaks a table] Oh, who am I kidding? I need to face the facts. [makes a strange face] Face the facts that I'm the little guy! [tears up, making another face] And that Mr. Krabs is letting me go today.
Squidward: [smiles] Krabs is letting you go today? [laughs] As in I won't have to work with you ever again. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [walks through the doors and becomes flattened, sad] Goodbye, Krusty Krab. Goodbye, life as I know it. [the wind blows SpongeBob away]
Mr. Krabs: [still on the phone] Yeah, as much as I don't like doing it, I have to let him go. [a little scallop in a cage is shown] Gotten too big for his cage. [releases the scallop] Go on, little guy. Fly away. You'll be missed.
[as scallop flies away, SpongeBob floats into his house, landing in a chair]
Gary: [meows questionly]
SpongeBob: Oh, what's the use, Gary? [body pops up to his normal self] I've lost the will to go on! [bursts into tears on the couch, then stops, noticing a rumble from a refrigerator Patrick is pulling with a rope] [sniffs sadly] Hi, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob. [happily] I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again.
SpongeBob: [confused] What happened to yours?
Patrick: Nothing, it's just empty.
SpongeBob: [sad] Oh, get it out of my sight! Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator.
Patrick: Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy. You can still purchase food for me.
SpongeBob: Oh, no I can't, Patrick. I lost my job today. I won't be able to buy food for you,[sniffs] or Gary, [sniffs again] or for anybody!
Patrick: [shocked] Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!
SpongeBob: [sad] I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else.
Patrick: [gets an idea, happily] I know, SpongeBob! Just do what I do when I'm looking for a job. [runs to couch, then sits on it] Kick back, watch some TV, [turns T.V on with remote, then holds a carton of Drinkable Sausage with a close-up shot of it] and chug down a carton on Drinkable Sausage! [drinks from the carton]
Gary: [meows while sitting on some newspaper]
SpongeBob: [happily] Good, Gary! There had to be some job openings in the classifieds. [picks up one newspaper while noticing its dirty smell] Whoa! Although, these ads smell a little out of date. I better get some fresh ones. [bubble transition to SpongeBob reading a clean newspaper] Lawyer, no. Too much arguing. Stunt driver, don't have a boating license. Astronaut, don't like food in a bag. Oh, this one sounds interesting. Bank Teller Needed. That shouldn't be too much of a stretch from fry cooking. [bubble transition to SpongeBob counting money at a bank while having his nametag on] 20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97. [flips money up with spatula, then chops it all up, some flying onto Fred's head, forming the money into a Krabby Patty, as seen in a close-up shot of it] Order up! [rings bell once, then employee takes SpongeBob's nametag off, causing SpongeBob to lose air inside of him] [bubble transition to SpongeBob hammering a nail while building a house] What do you think, boss?
Carpenter: [looks at house, shocked] Clam shells! What have you done, boy? [looks at a piece of paper showing what the real house looks like, while then looking at a house built by SpongeBob shaped into a Krabby Patty] I told you to build me a house, not a sandwich! [kicks SpongeBob and Patrick out of the construction site]
SpongeBob: I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick. [walks in front of a billboard showing a live sponge] I need to start fresh. [some words on billboard sparkle as SpongeBob talks] With a job that feels...natural. Something that says, "This is a job for a sponge." Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?
Patrick: No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!
SpongeBob: I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?
Patrick: Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy.
SpongeBob: That's just a billboard, Patrick.
Patrick: Why don't you get a job as a billboard?
SpongeBob: I...don't think that's physically possible, [happily] but I could audition to be a sponge model.
Patrick: Fine, do it your way.
[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick walking into the Bikini Bottom Television (BBTV) building]
SpongeBob: Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent.
Patrick: Oh, you have the talent. But do you have the natural ability?
SpongeBob: Yeah, but...wait, isn't that the same thing?
Patrick: Why don't you find out?
SpongeBob: [quickly covers the door] Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back. [starts walking out, but Patrick stops him]
Patrick: No way! It's too late for that now. Krabs doesn't need you anymore. This is your chance to prove you don't need him. Now get in there and earn me some groceries! [pushes SpongeBob through the door to a lady fish, a casting director, looking at a clipboard] [to casting director] My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role.
SpongeBob: Oh, well, want is a strong word. I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it. [to Patrick] I think she's already cast it. We'd better go, Patrick.
Casting Director: [stops SpongeBob and Patrick from walking out] Hold it. You want the audition, kid? You got it.
SpongeBob: [turns his whole body around, happily] I did?
Casting Director: Show me what you got.
SpongeBob: [sweats, worried] Okay. Here goes. [clears throat] Patrick, please? [Patrick hands out a metal tool and hits it on his forehead, playing a note] ♪ Laaa! ♪ [clears throat again] Sorry. [keeps clearing throat and getting a perfect pitch at the same time, from high to low]
Casting Director: Okay, okay, okay! Let's get on with this train wreck.
SpongeBob: Okay, getting on it. [clears throat yet again, then sings off-key] ♪ When you dream upon a wish, you'll be heartened to know, that hope fills your dish, to the brim! ♪
Casting Director: [unenthusiastically] All right, all right. Thank you. I've heard enough.
SpongeBob: [runs closely to the casting director] How'd I do?
Casting Director: Horribly. I've seen clams with more talent than you. [SpongeBob falls down] But since the role specifically calls for a real sponge, the part is yours. [SpongeBob slowly gets up] Here's the script. We start shooting tomorrow at 10. Don't be late. [SpongeBob rips himself in half, happily snatches the script, then jumps out of the building]
SpongeBob: I guess a sponge can make it in this town. [his pupils turn into stars] I am going to be a star! [a crowd suddenly comes close to SpongeBob, cheering while holding camera and microphones, while a news reporter faces a camera close to SpongeBob]
News Reporter: I'm standing here with the new face of television, Mr. SpongeBob SquarePants. [to SpongeBob] I'm sure the viewing audience would love to know, how does it feel to be the next big thing?
SpongeBob: Fantastic. [puts on sunglasses, then signs an autograph and waves at the crowd chanting, "SpongeBob! SpongeBob!"]
[cut to SpongeBob with his eyes closed]
Patrick: SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. Did you say something?
SpongeBob: Oh, yes I did, Patrick. [points to himself] I said, "You're looking at the new face of television."
Patrick: All right!
SpongeBob: Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep.
Patrick: Yeah, beauty sleep!
[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick walking on the road]
SpongeBob: That's right. You are looking at a changed sponge. But don't worry. I won't forget all the people who held me on the way up.
Mr. Krabs: [walks by, carrying golf supplies and even wearing golf clothes] Afternoon, boy-o!
SpongeBob: Ah, just as I was saying. I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start. I won't forget you. [he and Patrick walk by]
Mr. Krabs: [scratches his head] What was that about? Oh, probably just nonsense and babbling, as usual. [walks away]
[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Patrick on the street right next to SpongeBob's pineapple]
SpongeBob: Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television. [walks into his house]
[bubble transition to SpongeBob walking back into the Bikini Bottom Television (BBTV) building towards the casting director, working on a computer]
Casting Director: Oh, you're back!
SpongeBob: A star's first day is his most important.
Casting Director: Great. Let me see if they're ready on set. [through a microphone] SpongeBob's here, sir. Uh-huh. Okay, great. [to SpongeBob] Okay, you can go right in.
SpongeBob: Yippee! [happily runs into the set, toward a spotlight] I am ready for my close-up, Mr. Director.
Director: [with a French accent] Very well. [through a megaphone] Lose the pants! [a claw snatches SpongeBob's pants, making him naked] Hans! Where's my star?! [a live-action hand comes out of a dressing room and grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Whoa! What's happening? [lights turn on behind SpongeBob, showing a dirty bathroom set] Wh-wh-what's happening?!
Director: In this scene, you'll be cleaning bathroom mixtures.
SpongeBob: Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?
Director: [mumbles angrily and quietly] Don't you get it? You are the cleaning utensil. [SpongeBob suddenly frowns] Roll speed! [a red light turns on from a camera]
Charlie: [as a movie assistant, holding a movie clipboard] New Sponge Commercial: Take one. [closes clipboard]
Director: [through a megaphone] Action!
Announcer: [off-screen] Oh, no! Your bathroom is a disaster. Get it cleaned up fast with...the new sponge! [while on camera, SpongeBob groans] Household chores are a snap with new sponge. It cleans sinks. [sink shines after being cleaned by a now dirty SpongeBob] Just look at that shine! New sponge cuts through even the toughest grime and grit. New sponge also cleans showers! [SpongeBob screams while cleaning the shower, which shines too] Ha, ha! That tile looks good as new! [SpongeBob sighs, tired] But best of all, new sponge can make any toilet sparkle! [as SpongeBob hears this, he looks at the toilet dirty inside before going straight in]
SpongeBob: Nooo! [he suddenly stops right before he goes in] I can't do this!
Director: [through a megaphone] Cut!
SpongeBob:  I'm sorry. I don't think I'm cut out for acting.
Director: Was? You said you were professional actor.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not. [puts on his work hat] I am a fry cook. [holds up his spatula] That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister. [walks away]
Director: Wait! Wait!
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs making a money pyramid in his office]
Mr. Krabs: Ever so gently...
SpongeBob: [slams door loudly, causing Mr. Krabs' money pyramid to fall down] Mr. Krabs! [while crying a trail of tears toward Mr. Krabs] Please let me back, please! I promise I'll do better. [hugs Mr. Krabs] Please.
Mr. Krabs: Boy, what are you going on about?!
SpongeBob: [sniffles] I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go. But I don't wanna go! Please don't let me go, Mr. Krabs! You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go.
Mr. Krabs: All right, boy-o! I won't get rid of ya: on one condition. [SpongeBob happily nods]
[bubble transition to SpongeBob happily mopping a toilet]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! This is the best job in the world!
Hans: Hey, could you keep it down in there? [shown taking a dump in a stall] I'm trying to concentrate!
[episode ends]


[At the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: May I help you, sir?
Orange customer: I'd like that table over by the window. [points to the table behind him where Mary and Old Man Walker are sitting]
SpongeBob: As soon as the present customers are done with it. They like to chew their food thoroughly.
Mary: 97... 98... 99...
Old Man Walker: Don't rush me, woman!
Orange customer: Perhaps this will speed up the process. [shows him some money]
SpongeBob: How will that help them chew faster?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's the problem?
SpongeBob: No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table.
Orange customer: Five bucks if I get the table now. [Mr. Krabs kicks out Mary and Old Man Walker]
Mary: Ow, my hip.
Mr. Krabs: Enjoy your meal. Let me know if you need anything else.
SpongeBob: Why did you give him the table?
Mr. Krabs: You know what they say: "Money Talks."
SpongeBob: I didn't know money could talk. Did it tell you to kick those old people out? [talking to money] What do you have against old people?
Mr. Krabs: Don't go goofy on me, boy. Money can't really talk. Only fish can talk.
SpongeBob: Wouldn't it be neat if money could talk?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Yeah. Wait a minute...
Squidward: What's that music?
SpongeBob: I think Mr. Krabs is gonna sing.
Squidward: Oh, great.
Mr. Krabs: ♪If I could talk to money, how great my life would be. We'd tell each other secrets, all their friends would visit me. I'd bathe in filthy riches, which is clean enough for me. Oh, if you could tell me what you want, how happy we would be. We'd surely be the best of friends, we'd never disagree. There wouldn't be a downside, not one that I could see. If I could talk to money, come along, sing with me.♪
Squidward: Uh, no thanks, I got to go.
SpongeBob: I really have to pee.
Mr. Krabs: ♪If I could talk to money, and it could talk to me. We'd always be the best of friends, for all eternity.♪ [Mr. Krabs chortles]
Patrick: [comes out of the bathroom] What did I miss?
Mr. Krabs: ♪Oh...♪ [all mumbling and muttering] ♪If I could talk to money, how great my life...♪ [cuts to Mr. Krabs's house outside then inside] Parlez vous Francais? Hable Español? Ou-yay eak-spay ig-pay atin-lay? Mm-hmm. Maybe this will make you talk. Talk! You're being too hard on the little guy. You can talk to me. I'm your friend. [cries] I would give anything to talk to money. Anything!
Flying Dutchman: Anything?
Mr. Krabs: You?
Flying Dutchman: That's right. 'Tis I, the ominous Flying Dutchman. I'll grant your wish, but it'll cost you.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, my immortal soul. I've heard that speech before. [signs contract]
Flying Dutchman: Wha...? Well, uh, great. But be warned!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, skip the lecture. I want what's coming to me.
Flying Dutchman: Humph, you're no fun at all, you know that?
Mr. Krabs: Hey, is that pixie dust? [the Dutchman throws the dust into Mr. Krabs’ eyes. Mr. Krabs screams and runs around] Whew, that was a strange dream.
Nickel: You think that was a strange dream? I dreamt I was trapped in a prison made of peanut butter.
Mr. Krabs: Who said that?
Nickel: Down here.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, it's a nickel. What were you doing in my belly button, little fella?
Nickel: I got stuck in there during your last coin shower. [shudders] I don't want to talk about it.
Mr. Krabs: [takes his wallet and takes out a five-dollar bill] Do you have anything to say to me?
Dollar Bill: [Looks at Mr. Krabs decayed teeth] Yeah, when was the last time you brushed your teeth?
Mr. Krabs: It worked! I can talk to money. Oh...
Nickel: [cuts Mr. Krabs off] Please, don't start singing again. [cut to Krusty Krab, the next day]
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, darlings. Soon you'll be rejoined with all your friends. [kisses his money]
Mary: Oh, my, why don't you kiss me like that?
Old Man Walker: Don't start.
Squidward: That'll be five dollars. [puts money in register]
Five-Dollar Bill: Hey, dudes.
Money: Run, jump! Jump out! Jump out! [Squidward looks at the money before Mr Krabs closes the register and chuckles]
Mr. Krabs: [opens up his safe] Good morning, my darlings.
Money: Good morning, Mr Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You're coming home with me.
Money: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I did it. I can talk to money. [shows him a bag of money] Go ahead, say hello.
SpongeBob: Hello... money.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Oh, aren't they a riot? [walks out the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: I'm starting to worry about Mr Krabs.
Squidward: I'm worried he just left with my paycheck. [cut to Mr Krabs' house where he's on the floor with his money]
Mr. Krabs: Now that we're alone, let's tell each other secrets.
One-Dollar: What kind of secrets are you talking about?
Dime: Yeah, we live in a safe.
Money: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: You have any friends you can invite over?
One-Dollar: Aren't we enough for you?
Dime: Yeah, what's wrong with us?
Money: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, nothing. You guys are great. I thought you guys might want some company, you know, to make you happy.
Money: Why don't you ask what would make us happy?
Mr. Krabs: Okay, so how can I make you happy?
Money: Spend us!
Mr. Krabs: What?
Dime: We're money. It's in our nature.
One-Dollar: I've been trapped in that safe for eight years. I always wanted to be spent on a fairy princess outfit.
Mr. Krabs: What? No way.
Ten-Dollar: I want to be spent on corn dogs.
Five-Dollar: I want to be spent on diapers.
Money: Yeah, yeah, me too.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, wait a minute. I am not spending you on corn dogs, diapers, or fairy princess outfits. [cut to the mall]
Clerk: Did you find everything ok?
Mr. Krabs: [dressed up in the outfits that the money were talking about] Unfortunately.
Money: All right! [Mr. Krabs cries]
SpongeBob: [he walks up wearing a blue-purple fairy princess outfit. He also eats a corn dog. Under his outfit he has a diaper] Mr. Krabs, lookin' good. [Mr . Krabs screams and runs away]
Patrick: [he's dressed in a dark green princess outfit and also has on a diaper as he eats his corn dog] What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: I don't know. He's acting kind of weird. [cut back to Mr. Krabs' house, at dusk]
Money: [moaning] Spend us. Spend us.
Mr. Krabs: I can't spend all of you. And none of you want to be spent on stuff I want.
Money: Spend us.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, you're all shallow and self-absorbed. What did I ever see in you?
Money: Spend us.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not listening.
Money: Spend us.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not... [knock on door] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [back in his everyday clothes] Hi, Mr. Krabs. I just came by to make sure you weren't, you know, totally insane.
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles as he has bloodshot eyes] Take this bag as far away as possible and bury it. [closes door then nervously chuckles] Ah! What have I done? [opens door] Give me that back! [takes the bag of money back and closes door again]
SpongeBob: Okay, glad you're not insane. [he walks off. Cut to later]
Mr. Krabs: [he has a 5 o'clock shadow] Dutchman, you cheated me. Take this horrible curse away! [weeps] I want a refund.
Flying Dutchman: All sales are final from the Flying Dutchman, especially for a selfish shellfish like yourself. Try saying that three times fast. Your soul's going into me fanny pack of despair. [squeals] Now pay up. Huh? [He pulls a paper out of Mr. Krabs' pants] An I.O.U. [I Owe You]?
Mr. Krabs: Hehe, yeah, well, I sort of sold my soul already.
Flying Dutchman: What? To who?
Mr. Krabs: To those guys.
Monster: We were here first, pops.
Monster #2: We've all got a claim on Krabs's soul.
Monster: Get to the back of the line.
Mr. Krabs: Now, now, I'm sure we can sort this out.
[The Flying Dutchman gets to the back of the line. He sees SpongeBob in the line.]
Flying Dutchman: You too, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: He was five bucks short on payday. [Flying Dutchman sighs in disappointment]


Patrick: [walking] So why are we going to Sandy's house?
SpongeBob: To see her vacation slides for the hu.. [gets smacked in face by door] Ow!
ZDS Agent: [Walking out the door with his partner and the slides] We got the slides, sir.
Patrick: Who?...What?...Why?
[The both get dragged in by Sandy]
Sandy: [Taking SpongeBob and Patrick] Those two agents from the Zero Dryland Security just confiscated all my vacation slides, boys. Or so they think... [She pulls a tree trunk lever to activate a secret hideout] You see, [puts the two on two chairs. She goes to a copy of the vacation slides] Someone already made six copies.
[SpongeBob raises his hand]
Sandy: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Who is this someone? Do we know him?
Sandy: By someone, I was implying me, SpongeBob. [Patrick raises his hand] Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing.
[SpongeBob raises his hand again]
Sandy: [tying up SpongeBob and Patrick with rope] Okay, no more questions until the end of the slideshow. Okay? [they nod in agreement] Good. [shows the first slide] The first slide is of me getting some last-minute readings before I took off on my vacation. [switches to the next slide] And this is me giving the thumbs-up-goodbye for now salute. [shows the next slide] And this... [dreadfully] This is where a little square pal of mine decided to pay me a visit. 
[transition to SpongeBob visiting Sandy]
SpongeBob: [walking to Sandy's house] ♪I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy. I'm ready to see Sandy [spinning] I'm ready to ring Sandy's doorbell♪ [rings the doorbell; suddenly, an extreme humming noise vibrates the ocean floor] Sandy...! [a rocket emerges from beneath the ground] Whoa!
Sandy: What do you think of my moon wagon?
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I activated it! How was I to know it was hooked up to your doorbell?
Sandy: Oh no, SpongeBob. That's what you call a "coincidence." I'm getting ready for my vacation!
SpongeBob: Where are you going?
Sandy: The moon! [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: You're going on a moon trip?!
Sandy: Yep! I'm all packed up and ready to go. Wanna help me…
SpongeBob: I'll be right back!
Sandy: ...load up the moon wagon? [sighs]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is at bakery] Morning, Mr. Bakerman! Oh, that's right, I'm sorry. I have to pick a number. [attempts to pull a ticket, but fails and gets tangled up]
Bakerman: Number 12.
SpongeBob: Yes, I'm Number 12!
Bakerman: What can I get for you today?
SpongeBob: I need a bon voyage sheet cake. [Bakerman brings out out sheet cake] Could you put yummy words on it? Hmmmmm, what would those yummy words be? I got it! "Have fun on the moon...". What rhymes with "moon"? Tune? Roon? Noon? Goon?
Bakerman: How about "loon?"
SpongeBob: I got it! "See you soon!"
Countdown: [SpongeBob heads back to Sandy’s dome with the cake. The rocket is a few seconds from takeoff] T-minus 12, 11, 10, 9, 8…
SpongeBob: No, Sandy! Wait! You can't go without your sheet cake! [grabs a hold of the ladder, but falls into the rocket] Whoa!
Sandy: [sees SpongeBob] SpongeBob? What in cold chicken and pickles are you doing in my ship?
SpongeBob: [panting, and out of breath] I went to get you a, so I went to the, and then I got you a, and then T-minus something, and...
Countdown: Launch commencing.
Sandy: Never mind. Can't stop the countdown now. Better strap yourself down. Looks like you're going on a mooncation!
SpongeBob: I am?! Whoooooo! Moon trip! Moon trip! Moon trip! [rocket takes off] Hey, Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Sandy? Hey, Sandy...
Sandy: Uh, I'm kinda busy here, SpongeBob. Gotta recalculate to account for the extra weight.
SpongeBob: Oh, I just wanted to show you the...
Sandy: for the afterburners! [activates afterburners; propels rocket further] What were you saying, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I… brought you a "bon voyage" sheet cake.
Sandy: You can't bring regular food into space!
SpongeBob: Wha, wha, wha, why not?
Sandy: Because, as we leave Earth's gravity, everything becomes weightless, and any un-contained food will float off in all directions!
SpongeBob: Oh. Is that a bad thing?
Sandy: Only if it gets sucked into the reverse spatial linearity drive. [cake floats into the reverse spatial linearity drive. The rocket engine malfunctions and turns off] Ah nuts!
SpongeBob: Oops. Sorry, Sandy.
Sandy: [presses "Toss" button, and gets dressed in a large space suit] Well, it's a good thing I've brought my special space suit designed for just this kind of situation! Now, try not to file anything else up while I'm saving our necks. [goes into space] Aha! There's our problem. [clears the cake out from the the reverse spatial linearity drive.] Eh, could've used more nuts. [comes back inside rocket] Okay. I've got her up and running, again. Now, can you please sit with your hands folded for a while, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Roger that! Folding hands.
Sandy: Now, get ready for lunar module se...
SpongeBob: [folds hands into a bird] What do you think Sandy?
Sandy: Just don't touch anything while we separate.
SpongeBob: Ok.
Sandy: [detaches rocket from boosters] That looks like a good spot. [lands on the moon, sets camp up] Alright, SpongeBob. Now that our camp is set up, it's time for some moon crater boarding! [brings out boards]
SpongeBob: What's moon crater boarding?
Sandy: You ride these on that like this. [jumps on and rides her snowboard on the moon] Yeehaw! Right here is the Flip-a-dee-do-dah. [flips her board in midair] Right there is the classic Texas tail grab. [grabs tail, and twists it into the shape of Texas] And this I call the 7-20 Nut Drop. [spins and breaks an asteroid into an acorn and eats it] Munchie! And let's not forget my grandpappy's favorite: The Tour de Saturn. [lies down on Saturn's rings] Star gazer! Yeehaw! Nothing like extreme sports and zero gravity! Alright your turn.
SpongeBob: Oh gee Sandy. I don't know. This looks kinda scary.
Sandy: Oh, come on SpongeBob. You got this! It's a can of corn.
SpongeBob: I don't know what corn is, but I sure like cans. Alright, I'll give it a try. [jumps on board and floats off into space] Sandy, this doesn't seem right.
Sandy: Uh oh! Looks like SpongeBob's too light for lunar gravity. SpongeBob, grab a hold of this! [lassos asteroid to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [grabs onto asteroid] Ok. [the rock pulls SpongeBob to the moon surface. SpongeBob begins to surf the moon, but screams]
Sandy: Wow, SpongeBob! What do you call that trick? [SpongeBob keeps screaming] Interesting. Maybe you can teach me how to do a "Waaaaah!"
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob continues screaming, and begins to surf over a satellite] Hey, this is kind of fun! [leaps, and bounces off the satellite, damaging it]
Frankie Billy: [shifts to Patrick watching TV] Carol, your real father is… [TV goes out due to satellite damage]
Patrick: Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!
SpongeBob: [scene returns to SpongeBob] Watch this Sandy! [ties an asteroid to his helmet to hold him down] Alright. A no-look... let's see... a one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up… [accidentally smashes into rocket's fuel tank, making it leak] puncture into the side of the rocket.
Sandy: You did great, SpongeBob! But, you should call your trick the "no-look, one-footed, tongue-out, flip, leg up, puncture the fuel tank on the rocket.”
SpongeBob: Oops!
Sandy: Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get while there's still enough fuel to make it home!
SpongeBob: Wait! I have to do something very important! [takes picture of himself “holding the earth”] There! [both go into the rocket, and head for earth] So, we are going to make it, aren’t we Sandy?
Sandy: If the fuel holds out, there's no reason to panic. [rocket fuel signs shows “Empty”. Rocket starts falling to earth] Without the engines, we've lost all control. We're coming in too steep!
SpongeBob: Is that bad?
Sandy: [unbuckles seatbelt] Only if you consider being consumed in a giant fireball “bad”.
SpongeBob: Well, in that case, I won't... giant fireball?! [unbuckles seatbelt, but hits wall] Sandy, where are you going?
Sandy: 'm going to take this bull by the horns! [Lassos the nose of the rocket. Rocket begins to catch fire as it descends towards earth]
SpongeBob: Are we gonna get consumed in a giant fireball?
Sandy: Not if I can keep her nose up we aren't. Hang on! It's gonna get bumpy when we hit the atmosphere. [the rocket keeps falling at a faster rate. SpongeBob yells in terror] Yeehaw!
SpongeBob: [continues screaming] My goodness!
Sandy: Yeehaw! Yeehaw! [rockets crashes]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh my gosh! Sandy! Sandy, are you okay? [Sandy groans] Oh, Sandy. I'm sorry I ruined your vacation.
Sandy: Ruined? Oh heck no! That was the most fun I've had in a toad's age! Once I get my rocket fixed, you and me is heading to Mars. Now, let's go grab another one of them sheet cakes.
Both of them: [laugh]


[The scene begins with a boat driving up to the intersection between the Chum Bucket and the Krusty Krab. A bureaucrat fish steps out of the car and places a stake into the street. He then places two signs on both of the hangers.]
Mr. Krabs: [inside Krusty Krab] Hmm. What could be the doings of this stranger?
Plankton: [inside Chum Bucket] This looks suspicious.
Mr. Krabs and Plankton: [both Mr. Krabs and Plankton step out of their restaurants toward the male fish] What's the big idea?
State Officer: Mr. Eugene Krabs and Sheldon Plankton?
Plankton and Mr. Krabs: Yes?
State Officer: These are for you. [walks away. They both look at the two signs]
Plankton and Mr. Krabs: [reading the signs] "Updated city ordinance: Fast Food Restaurants cannot be within 100 feet of each other". Huh?
State Officer: The Krusty Krab and The Chum Bucket are located too close together. One of your restaurants is going to have to be bulldozed. 
Plankton and Mr. Krabs: [in shock] B - B - B - Bulldozed!? [They measure the distance between the 2 restaurants with Tape Measures]
Plankton: [in shock] 99 feet!
Mr. Krabs: [sad] It's true!
Plankton: [letting go of the tape measure] Ah! [crashes into pole] Oof!
Mr. Krabs: [suspicious] Which one of us is gonna get bulldozed?
State Officer: That's for you two to decide.
Mr. Krabs: [angry] I'm not going anywhere!. You're the one who is moving!
Plankton: [angry] You are moving!
Mr. Krabs: Ohoho! No, you are!
Plankton: Oh, no I'm not!
State Officer: [interrupts them] Gentlemen, you have 24 hours to decide which of you moves. That's the law around here! [He drives off]
Mr. Krabs: [angry] Pack your bags pipsqueak!
Plankton: [angry] You might as well close up shop right now, Krabs. Your customers won't miss a thing.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] At least I have customers.
Plankton: [angry] Oh yeah!? Well I'm gonna put together a... uh... a petition of customer signatures.
Mr. Krabs: Ha! Good luck with that ludicrous idea! [walks to Krusty Krab]. [confused] Petition? [Walks through doors] Squidward! SpongeBob!
[Squidward puts magazine down] [SpongeBob zooms to Mr. Krabs while Squidward walks]
Mr. Krabs: [hands petitions to SpongeBob and Squidward] You two take these petitions to save The Krusty Krab and secure as many signatures as you can!
SpongeBob: [saluting] Sir, yes, sir!
Squidward: [sarcastic] Oh yeah, I'm definitely gonna do this.
SpongeBob: [signing] And I'm gonna be the first signature. There and how about you Squidward? Could we count on your support? [in shock to see Squidward gone and the petition still there] Squidward?
[Bubble transition to Mrs. Puffs Boating School]
SpongeBob: Hello, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: [frightened] No! Stay away! I can't afford to go back in the slammer!
SpongeBob: I'm just here if you would sign this petition. It'll save the Krusty Krab from getting bulldozed!
Mrs. Puff: Why would I care about that?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mrs. Puff, don't you care what happens to Mr. Krabs? Squidward? Gary? Me?
Mrs. Puff: Not particularly.
Delivery Man: [walks in the classroom] Excuse me? I'm looking for a Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Yes, that's me.
Delivery Man: Your new boat's here. Just sign here, please. [Mrs. Puff signs the paper]
SpongeBob: Speaking of signatures, would you sign this petition to save the Krusty Krab? [SpongeBob hands out a piece of paper]
Delivery Man: Why would I care about the Krusty Krab? [annoyed] I'll unload the boat. [SpongeBob and the delivery man both walk out of the classroom. SpongeBob notices something about the boat.] [closeup of the boat's lever]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Delivery Man. I got this. [SpongeBob pushes down the boat's lever. It moves backwards, heading straight towards the school. Mrs. Puff notices this.]
Mrs. Puff: Noo! [She closes the door, when the boat crashes into the school. Mrs. Puff puffs up.]
[bubble transition to SpongeBob walking on the street]
SpongeBob: [He comes to a repair man close to a boat, who looks at a piece of paper] Excuse me, sir. Would you like to sign a petition to save the Krusty Krab?
Repair Man: [confused] Why would I want to do that? The food there is dangerous. [closeup of the paper that says, "Krabby Patties are Dangerous" as SpongeBob reads it]
SpongeBob: [worried] Sir, where did you get this?
Repair Man: It was on my windshield. They're all over the place! [even more copies of the paper are attached to buildings]
SpongeBob: This must be Plankton's dirty plan. [cut to SpongeBob running towards the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [As he enters, many people with papers all talking at once angrily to Mr. Krabs]
Nat: Hey, Mr. Krabs! Why are your patties dangerous?
Everyone: Yeah! [They keep talking at once.]
Mr. Krabs: [worried] I...I...uh... My...my patties are dangerous because...because they're so...uh...uh...they're so-
SpongeBob: [comes out of the kitchen with a plate of Krabby Patties] Delicious!
Nat: [as everyone else stares] Kid's got a point. [Everyone talks at once happily. They start taking the patties.]
Mr. Krabs: [leans closer to SpongeBob] Thanks for saving me shell, boy!
SpongeBob: Don't thank me, Mr. Krabs. Thank the Krabby Patty.
Plankton: [growls, then returns to the Chum Bucket, sad] That does it!
Karen: Throwing in the napkin, are we?
Plankton: [sobs loudly on a suitcase] My restaurant. My laboratory. My evil inventions. All about to be flattened! Just give me a moment to say my goodbyes. [walks sadly by his former things while holding the suitcase] Farewell, stench-vision goggles. Farewell, Chum Bucket replicator. Farewell, hypnotizer helmet. We had some diabolical times together, didn't we? [walks to a cannon] So long, sonic cannon that destroys every known material in the universe. [As he accidentally sobs on the cannon's button, it activates, and makes a hole, destroying part of the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob sees this while humming on the street. He finally hears Plankton crying, sobbing while laying down.]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Plankton, I'm sorry. [sniffs] Sorry I made my Krabby Patty so delicious. [sobs]
Plankton: [angry] Hey, get lost! I'm the only one that weeps around here.
SpongeBob: But I can't help it think that I somehow had a hand in your misery. Or at least a spatula. Nobody would sign a petition to bulldoze the Krusty Krab unless you pay them. And who would be low enough to do that?
Plankton: [smiles, closes a door, then chuckles evilly] Karen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Karen: Before you start buying up those petition signatures, you should know that our checking account balance is [shown on her screen] negative $375.
Plankton: Not to worry, my lady. I have a plan.
Mr. Krabs: [cut to him looking through a telescope] Hmm... Now there's something you don't see every day.
SpongeBob: [serves Krabby Patties to a three-headed fish] Three-Headed Jake? He comes in every day.
Mr. Krabs: Not him. I'm referring to the large crowd gathered at the Chum Bucket. It appears they are actually giving Plankton... money?! [A customer gives Plankton money while wearing the hypnotizer helmet from earlier.]
Plankton: You just got a steal, sir. You'll get many villainous years out of that little number. [He chuckles evilly, then jumps up to put the money in the cash register.] I'll forget this restaurant nonsense, Karen. I should've opened a yard sale business years ago. [Fish look at stuff.] Step up, fishes. Every evil invention is price to move!
Charlie: I'll take this riptide generator off your hands! [gives Plankton money]
Nat: [He wears the goggles from earlier.] I'll give you $1,000 for the stench-vision goggles. [puts the money on Plankton's antennas]
Pilar: [points at Karen] Hey, how much for the computer?
Plankton: How much you got?
Karen: [angry] Plankton!
Plankton: All right. My wife's not for sale. [to everyone] But everything else must go! [Everyone cheers and gives Plankton even more money, smiling. Plankton sticks his head out of the stack.] Well, wifey. Looks like it's time to proceed to the next phase. [As he pulls a rope, the sign changes from "Yard Sale" to "$ for your signature".] [through a megaphone, holding a dollar] Who wants free money? [Everyone notices.]
Dennis: [turns his head] Free?!
Debbie: [also turns her head] Money?! [Everyone happily runs to the stand.]
Nat: Free money! [Angrily, he turns a boat to the other side then joins everyone else. The boat catches on fire and explodes.]
Plankton: [Everyone crowds around him.] Okay, okay. One at a time, please. [holding a dollar] To receive your free money, [holding a piece of paper attached to a clipboard] just sign this petition to save the Chum Bucket.
Pilar: Ooh, ooh. Me first. [As he signs the petition, Plankton gives him a dollar, then laughs evilly.] Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: [He walks in the Krusty Krab, angry.] This is outrageous! [to SpongeBob] You see what Plankton's doing, don't ya? He's undermining the democratic process by lab raging his temporarily financial windfall in order to buy every signature in Bikini Bottom. [counts his change] There's 20, 40, 50... We just bought mine 4 times! And me tasty food is one thing. [points out the window] But how can I compete with free money? [sad] I'm doomed! Well... clean around, boy. Border up. I'm afraid we're closing up for good. [sobs while biting his finger]
SpongeBob: [sad] Mr. Krabs is hurt so much!
Squidward: [laughs hysterically] Whoo... priceless.
Plankton: [meanwhile, as everyone cheers...] [happily] Thank you, thank you! I've got what I need! [holding up the clipboard and paper] I got the signatures! [confused while looking at the paper] All but one. Guess I won't be hiring the yellow sponge anytime soon. [evilly happily] But none of that matters now! Cause the majority is on my side! Which in a democracy is all you need.
[Meanwhile, cut to SpongeBob putting mayonnaise in a box, then taping it up, then cut to Mr. Krabs putting down a clock as a bulldozer arrives.]
Mr. Krabs: [sad] It's time. [He goes outside on the street and waits for the truck to stop in front of him.]
State Officer: [puts one of the bulldozer's windows down] So, who's getting bulldozed today?
Plankton: [with the clipboard] Oh, not me, your bureaucraticness. I completed my petition. [Mr. Krabs is worried.]
State Officer: The people have spoken. Step aside, Mr. Krabs. [Part of the bulldozer smokes fire out.]
Mr. Krabs: But... but... [As he backs up, the bulldozer follows him, towards the Krusty Krab.] [angry] No! I'm not going anywhere!
State Officer: Please comply, Mr. Krabs. It'll be quick and painless.
Mr. Krabs: If you wanna bulldoze me restaurant, [locks himself up] it's gonna be long and painful!
SpongeBob: [is seen at the top of the restaurant, also locked up] [angry] Stand your ground, Mr. Krabs! We are right behind you, right, Squidward? [The lock is empty.] Squidward?
Squidward: [He is outside his home, with an umbrella on top of him, sitting on a chair, and drinking a cup of tea, happily.]
State Officer: [He moves his bulldozer closer to the restaurant.] Okay, now this is really your last chance.
Mr. Krabs: [still angry] I'm never leaving the Krusty Krab!
State Officer: Fine. Have it your way. [He pushes a lever.]
Plankton: [He chuckles evilly, while setting up himself a movie theater seat, then sits on it.] Bring it on! Bring the destruction! [munches on popcorn]
Mr. Krabs: [Part of the bulldozer smokes more fire out, and the bulldozer starts to move even closer to the restaurant.] [sad] Goodbye, Krusty Krab! [As he closes his eyes, the bulldozer begins to move the restaurant, but only moves 1 foot.] [confused] Eh?
State Officer: Thank you for your cooperation.
Plankton: [spits the popcorn out, angry] What?! Excuse me, sir, but, uh... [stands on the seat] you forgot to level the place!
Mr. Krabs: [confused] Uhh... yeah.
State Officer: Demolition is outside of my purview. I simply ensure that restaurants comply with the 100 foot ordinance. [He measures the distance with a tape measure and says the 1 foot on it.] That's 1 more foot. Perfect! [He walks away from the restaurant.]
Plankton: [jumping on the seat, still angry] But that's not fair! [He slips inside and the seat closes on him.]
SpongeBob: So you're not gonna destroy the Krusty Krab?
State Officer: No...
SpongeBob: [He jumps inside the bulldozer, hugging the bureaucrat fish.] Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [As the bureaucrat fish accidentally pulls the lever, the truck goes backwards. He and SpongeBob look out the window.] Oh, dear. [The bulldozer crashes through the Chum Bucket, destroying it.]
Plankton: [Meanwhile, he's free from the seat after struggling to.] [still angry] Come on! Let's do this! I wanna see some destruction! [As he gasps, he finally sees the destroyed Chum Bucket.] I think I've seen enough. [He goes back inside the seat]


Narrator: Snark Chat with Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: And we're back. My first guest had dinner with me just last night. He's a close personal friend of mine. Please welcome the Krabby Patty. [audience clap] Great to have you back on the program.
Krabby Patty: Great to be here, BB.
Bubble Bass: Well, I'm sorry to say it, but last night, you were not quite as delicious as one would hope.
Krabby Patty: Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Mr. Krabs will give you a refund. [percussion sting] [laughter]
Mama Bass: Bubble Bass, who are you talking to down there?
Bubble Bass: Mother! Please stop trying to undermine my fantasy talk show! [Krabby Patty thuds] Mmph.
Mama Bass: You march yourself upstairs this instant! Take out the garbage, dry the dishes, and walk the worm!
Bubble Bass: Ooh, I don't feel like it!  Huh? [Mama Bass throws garbage, two dishes, and the worm at Bubble Bass] That tears it, Mother! [grunts] I am moving out! [slams the front door]
Mama Bass: Moving? Hah! You can't even do your own laundry! [grunts]
Bubble Bass: [underwear lands on Bubble Bass's face, and a fly is heard buzzing. SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing in the background] All I need to do is find two able-bodied idiots. But where am I to find such stupidity on such short notice? Hm... [wagoon crashes into Bubble Bass]
SpongeBob: Whoops. [Bubble Bass grunts] Sorry, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: Why you two able-bodied idiots! I—  [gasps and giving an evil grin] Ooh. [Patrick sobbers and SpongeBob blinks strangely] Why, SpongeBob and Patrick, my occasional friends. How would you two like to earn a free lunch?
Patrick: Freeeeeee lunch! [His head turns as if a balloon and then explodes]'
Bubble Bass:  All righty, we're moving all of my belongings out of my mother's basement into my grandmother's basement across town. Let's start with my lounge.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, up with the loveseat. [grunts]
Bubble Bass: [fakes having his back popped by breaking a stick] Ow! My bad back! I guess you two will have to move everything without me. So I'll meet you both at this address.
SpongeBob: But don't you have to pack your things before we can move 'em?
Bubble Bass: Ooh, ahh, I guess you'll have to pack my stuff too. But remember with gastric prizes await your mouths.
SpongeBob: [beat horn blares from ship]  Oh, Patrick [puts a finger inside Patrick's mouth, causing him to fill up and release water]
Bubble Bass: [laughs]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get p-p-p-packing!
Patrick: [grumbles trying to fit a stool into the box, breaking the stool in the process] [hums]
SpongeBob: Oh... [grunts] [puts on welder's helmet and turns on torch] [hums] [laughs]
SpongeBob: [pushes computers in the box grunting]
Patrick: [grunts] [water from toilet splashes] [toilet shatters]
SpongeBob: [grunts]
Both: [both grunt trying to push wooden planks]
Patrick: [hits mail-box with an ax, causing clanging]
SpongeBob: [exclaims] [spits out mail]
Patrick: [gasps]
SpongeBob: [grunts]
Patrick: All right, that's the last of it.
SpongeBob: Whew, I hope we didn't leave anything behind.
Patrick: [grunts] [part of the house clangs]
Kids: [laughs]
SpongeBob: [grunts]
Old Man Jenkins: [screams]
Both: [grunts]
SpongeBob: Oh pardon us, ma'am, but could you walk around?
Ms. Mildred: Walk around? Hmph, I'm Lady Upturn the 333rd, and you want me to walk around? [laughs] I'm afraid you just have to back it up.
SpongeBob: Back it up? [backup alarm blares] Okay. Back it up, Patrick.
Patrick: What'd you say?
SpongeBob: [grunts] Oh, oh, oh!
Patrick: [grunts] [giggles afterward]
SpongeBob: [pants] [screams]
Ms. Mildred: [screams] [grunts]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): [exclaims]
Ms. Mildred: Oh! [spits shoe out]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): [both exclaim] [cars vroom, scratching their behind] Huh? [embarrassed shock]
SpongeBob: Phew, hey, Patrick, from now on, we gotta be more careful. Huh? Patrick...
Patrick: [giggles, thinking about the free lunch] [SpongeBob blows the thought away] [exclaims]
SpongeBob: Oh, focus, Patrick, focus!
Patrick: Okay. [grunts "focusing"]
SpongeBob: Ah, that's perfect. [grunts] [laughs] [grunts again]
Patrick: [giggles] [starts grunting]
Both: Hmm? [screams]
Snail: [meows after being stuck on the bag]
Old Man Jenkins: [mumbles] I can walk! [turns around] Oh!
'Kids: [laughs] [Ryan screams, along with SpongeBob and Patrick] [bag comes back to get the other two] Oh!
Old Man Jenkins: [exclaims briefly]
Babies: [laughter]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): Babies?!
SpongeBob: [grunts] [motor revs]
Both: [screams] [tires screech]
Babies: [babbles]
Bag: [thuds on SpongeBob and Patrick]
Random People: [scream]
Patrick: [grunts] SpongeBob? Where are you?
SpongeBob: [grunts] I'm down here. [giggles]
Patrick: [giggles] Shall we, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: We shall, Patrick
Both: [both hum]
Babies: [laughter]
Both: Babies? No! [screams]
Babies: [laughter]
Both: Whoa! [both grunt]
SpongeBob: Hmm...Hm? [turns paper around] Hey, this is the address! We made it, Patrick! Nice aim, babies!
Patrick: Hooray! Now, where's that free lunch? [slurps] [thinks again about it]
SpongeBob: [groans] [slaps Patrick] Focus! Let's get all this stuff inside the house, then we can eat. Hmm, hmm.
Patrick: Hmm, hmm.
Both: [both hum]
SpongeBob: Oh, Bubble Bass, special delivery. [shocked] Hmm? Okay, Patrick, push it!
Both: [both grunt] [bag thuds]
Patrick: [goes through the back door to pull it] [becomes muscular] [destroys the house] And that's how you do it.
SpongeBob: [frightened] Uh-oh, Patrick. Look what we did to Bubble Bass's granny's house.
Fruit man: This wasn't Bubble Bass's grandmother's house. That is! [points to Bubble Bass's grandmother's house] This was my house!
SpongeBob: Well, that's a relief. For a minute there, I thought we did something wrong.
Both: Whew.
Fruit man: [blows up and hat flies down]
Both: [both grunt]
SpongeBob: [looks down] Don't look down, Patrick!
Patrick: [zips eyes] I turned off my eyes. [wind gusting]
SpongeBob: [whimpers] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh! [hiccups] Uh-oh, Patrick, I think I have the—  [hiccups again] Hiccups.
Patrick: Hiccups? I want some. I'm so hungry!
SpongeBob: [hiccups again, exclaims] Here comes another one, Patrick.
Patrick: [blocks SpongeBob's hiccup, grunting]
SpongeBob: Thanks, buddy. We're almost there. Just a few more steps, and we'll claim that free lunch.
Patrick: Yeah—  [hiccups saying "Hiccup!"]
Both: [bridge collapses, both grunt]
SpongeBob: Well, this is a dilly of a pickle.
Babies: [laughter]
Ms. Mildred: Back it up!
Both: [both scream]
Ms. Mildred: Back it up! [x2]
Babies: [laughter]
Ms. Mildred: [hits Patrick in the head with a shoe]
Both (SpongeBob and Patrick): [both scream] Oof, ta-da, Oof.
Bubble Bass: I hope you didn't damage my goods.
SpongeBob: Oh, your goods are all good, Bubble Bass. And we sure build up an appetite for that free lunch.
Patrick: [gulps out a bib and fork and knife]
Bubble Bass: Oh, yes, about that. I'm afraid I was waiting for you so long that I ate them! [eats the paper bags] Mmm. [belches]
SpongeBob: [whimpers]
Patrick: [inhales and swallows the fork, knife, and bib. grumbles] If my friend SpongeBob doesn't get his free lunch, [a realistic close-up of Patrick's face] things are gonna get crazy! [pants while Bubble Bass melts]
SpongeBob: That was the meanest thing I ever saw, Bubble Bass. You, sir, have crossed the line of aquatic decency. You might think you took a couple of bottom feeders like us for a ride today, but I got a newsflash for you, slappy. These bottom-feeders wouldn't eat your free lunch if you paid us.
Patrick: I would.
SpongeBob: Come, Patrick. I'll make you a free Krabby Patty for $2.50 plus tax.
Bubble Bass: [watches the pair leave and laughs] Well, you pulled it off, Bubble Bass. And you didn't even have to flick a fin. [hums and opens a box]
Mama Bass: [emerges from a box and growls] Bubble Bass, why do you think it's funny to pack your mother in a box and drag her all over town?!
Bubble Bass: [Shocked] Mother?! [grunts as she picks him up and stuffs him in two boxes]
Mama Bass: [Pulls a dolly out her hair] We'll just see how you like it! [pants as she pushes him]
Bubble Bass: I didn't do it! [Mama bass bumps into a mailbox] Ow! [bumps him into a building] Mother, please—  [grunts] It was SpongeBob and Patrick! [grunts] I'll dry the dishes, Mommy. [grunts] I love you, Mommy.


Mr. Krabs: Who's ready for some excitement?
SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Pearl: We are! [Squidward is sitting idly by]
Mr. Krabs: Who is ready for some fun?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We are!
Mr. Krabs: Who's ready to look at some vacation pictures?
Patrick and Sandy: We... huh?
Mr. Krabs: [turns off lights and turns on a slideshow and turns it to a picture of a dollar] I'm sure you know this charming fellow! [changes slide to him catching money] Here's the one that almost got away! [changes slide to a pile of money] Look at these pile towers of golden green! [changes slide to the Krusty Krab] Here's how the whole thing started! [cuts to flashback]
Squidward: That will be $6.75, please. [Takes money from the customer]
Mr. Krabs: [on a loud speaker] Attention! Attention, all employees of the Krusty Krab! Report immediately to the main office!
Squidward: [walks off]
Frankie Billy: Hey! What about my change?
SpongeBob: [Appears from the door to Mr. Krabs' office] You called Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: That's right. You better have a seat laddy. Gentlemen! I have an announcement to make. As of tomorrow, I'm closing the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: Hallelujah! [Charges out the door]
SpongeBob: [In shock gasping]
Mr. Krabs: Relax, boy! I'm just going on vacation for a few days. [Moves next to SpongeBob who is still in shock] Yesiree, laddy! I think the old Krusty Krab can afford a few days in dried up while I take little Pearl to a long, overdue vacation. And I was kinda hoping, that you come along with us, SpongeBob. [echo many times] Come along with us, SpongeBob. Come along with us...For a nominal fee of course. So, what do think, boy?
SpongeBob: [Smiles brightly]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? [Starts shaking SpongeBob] SpongeBob!?
SpongeBob: [His eyes who are now like Magic 8 Balls show "Yes" and "Please"] Yes! Please!
Mr. Krabs: Great! We'll have some fun! [Laughs and SpongeBob falls over]
[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' house]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, my dear! Are you all packed and ready to go?
Pearl: You bet your bottom dollar!
Mr. Krabs: Me bottom dollar? Why I never do that!
Pearl:  It's just an expression daddy. I just mean I'm really excited! [Walks outside with Mr. Krabs and spots SpongeBob] Gasp!
SpongeBob:  La la la la la la la la la!
Pearl: Daddy! One of your employees is in the back seat!
SpongeBob:  [Singing] 🎵Going on vacation with Mr. Krabs! Going on vacation with his daughter Pearl! Going on vacation with the whole Krabs clan! La la la la la la!🎵 I'm a vaaacation man! [Stops singing and spots Mr. Krabs and Pearl] Hey travel buddies!
Pearl: Daddy! I thought this was supposed to be OUR family vacation!?
Mr. Krabs: Eh... It still is! SpongeBob's... like a son to me! Plus he'll pay a top dollar to tag along.
SpongeBob:   [notices Pearl walk closer to Mr. Krabs' boat] Hi Pearl! Looks like you and I get to spend some quality time together!
Pearl: You know, SpongeBob. We got an old family tradition of having our guests ride on the floor with the luggage until we leave town! [throws her suitcase at SpongeBob knocking him to the floor]
SpongeBob:  [Raises arm up which is bent] I will happily honor this family tradition.
Mr. Krabs: See? You two are already having fun together! [laughs and drives off past SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick's houses]
Squidward:  [Laying on a chair] And there they go! Two whole days of no work and no SpongeBob! This is almost too good to be true! Nothing can possibly go wrong!
Patrick: [Appears behind Squidward] Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
SpongeBob: Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Did you hear something?
Pearl: Just the sound of this vacation dying!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, cheer up pumpkin puss! We're almost there!
SpongeBob: [Raises arm] Um, is time to come up yet?
Pearl: Sure, why not? Join the funeral. Super Mega Mall World? Is that where we going?
Mr. Krabs: Noooo! No. The place we are going is much better! [Drives past Super Mega Mall World]
SpongeBob: Um, Mr. Krabs? Think we could make a bathroom stop?
Mr. Krabs: But we are making such great time! Try to hold it a little longer lad!
Pearl: Holly molly! We're going to Planet Rollercoaster! [Mr. Krabs drives past it] But, daddy? W-why aren't we stopping?
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] The place we are going is 100 times better than that old amusement park!
SpongeBob: Is it Bathroom Land? 'Cause I could really use a bathroom right now!
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] Bathroom Land! Oh, SpongeBob! You kill me!
Pearl: Yeah! He's a real chuckle factory. [laughs sarcastically]
Mr. Krabs: [Continues driving] Ok, kids! We're just about there! Just over that hill, is the greatest sight in the sea! Now close your eyes for a big surprise!
Pearl: [closes eyes and crosses fingers] Teenage Boy Museum! Teenage Boy Museum!
SpongeBob: [Closes eyes and crosses legs] Bathroom! Bathroom!
Mr. Krabs: [Stops driving] Ok! We're here! You can open your eyes now!
Pearl: [she and SpongeBob open their eyes] Yay! The Teenage Boy Museum! [a wrecking ball suddenly knocks down the Teenage Boy Museum] It was right there!
Mr. Krabs: Oh... that's okay, honey. We weren't going there anyway. That's where we're going!
Pearl: Gasp!
Mr. Krabs: It's the Bikini Bottom Mint! Where they make all of the money! Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in all of your life?
Mr. Krabs: Well, laddy! Looks like it's just you and me! And of course, the Mint! [Hearts in eyes fly off]
[Bubble transition to inside the Bikini Bottom Mint]
Mr. Krabs: Is this the most exciting day in you life?
SpongeBob: Not really.
SpongeBob: Bill? [Laughs]
Bill: and yes... I am aware of the hilarious irony between my name and my job. Now, I'll be your tour guide for today. This tour will take you through the entire money process.
Mr. Krabs: You hear that, boy? [Eyes in SpongeBob's face] The entire money making... process!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I... [Takes Mr. Krabs' eyes off his face] ...sure did sir!
Bill: [Leading the crowd] This just to your right is the first part of the dollar making process. [Shows the crowd people behind the glass window operating a pressing machine] Where very special sheets of paper are prepped for...
Mr. Krabs: Guah guah guah guah guah! [Starts licking the glass window]
SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is staring at us. [Shakes Mr. Krabs] Sir, get a hold of yourself! It's just paper!
Mr. Krabs: Just paper? That's like saying the ocean is just water! Or, or the Krabby Patty's just a... a... a sandwich!
Bill: Ahem...
Mr. Krabs: Oh! [Dusts off SpongeBob] Uh... uh...
Bill: [Walks the crowd to a new area] And in this area here to my left, we see the process in which the sheets of silver are pressed into... [The machine then pounds the silver sheet into coins] ...shiny blank coins which are collected in back of one million pieces for the coining press.
Mr. Krabs: Wuh wuh wuh... o-o-one million shiny pieces of... [His eyes start to inflate] silver coins? [His eyes explode with the pieces flying]
Bill: They call... [Gets hit in the face by pieces of Mr. Krabs' eyes and the rest hit the other tourists]
SpongeBob: Uh oh! I thought this might happen! [Takes out a box that says "Replacement Eyes" and screws the eyes into Mr. Krabs and turns him on]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Anytime sir! Oh! The tour's leaving without us! [Points to Bill and the others moving forward]
Bill: [Talking with the tourists]
SpongeBob: We better catch up with them before we miss something, right Mr. Krabs? [Notices Mr. Krabs is gone and looks over] Gasp! [Sees Mr. Krabs on the conveyor belt getting ready to be crushed by the machine] [yelling] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: He he he he!
SpongeBob: [Pushes Mr. Krabs out of the way but gets crushed instead turning into many coins] I'm not sure how I feel about this sudden change! [Laughs] Good one, huh, Mr. Krabs? AHHH! [Reforms back together] Watch out, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [Holding a coin and moving down the conveyor belt] Hello! My name is Eugene! What's yours? [A machine with a needle makes the face on one coin and moves up towards it] Do you believe in love at first sight?
SpongeBob: [Swings by and saves Mr. Krabs] Phew... that was close.
Mr. Krabs: I'd say! I almost had that quarter's phone number!
Mr. Krabs: Pretty neat, huh, boy? That's where they... [Claw pops and his whole arm deflates and yells ] ...Destroy money!? No! [Charges to the shredder looking at the shredded money] [screaming]  Noo! Why? Why? [Starts crying a fountain]
SpongeBob: [Puts buckets on both sides of Mr. Krabs] It's okay, sir. I'm sure I...
Mr. Krabs: [Arms and nose pop off as he continues to cry from all ends, starting to flood the Mint]
SpongeBob: Wah oh! [Feet turn into propellers and he swims toward Mr. Krabs turning a knob on him which stops him from crying then sucks up all of the tears and tries to spit them out the window but goes through the wall instead.]
SpongeBob: [Finishes spitting]
Mr. Krabs: [Rocking on the ground speaking gibberish]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! It's okay! [Picks up Mr. Krabs] The shredded money is recycled and turned into brand, new money! See? [Shows Mr. Krabs the new dollars being made]
Mr. Krabs: It's a miracle!
SpongeBob: Yay!
Bill: [growls angrily] That is it! I have had enough of your nonsense! Guards, show these good for nothing dawdlers out right now... [sees the guards tied up and robbers stealing money] Oh, my. [hides behind his tourists] Angry thieving criminals aren't part of this tour. Uh, take whatever you want!
Skinny Robber: Take care of them!
Muscular Robber: No problem, boss! [Growls and moves toward the crowd]
Mr. Krabs: [Jumps in] Oh no you don't! You filthy dollar wrestler! [Throws SpongeBob at the Muscular Robber, which has no effect]
SpongeBob: That didn't work at all! [Falls to the ground]
Muscular Robber: Grrrr...
Mr. Krabs: Grrrr...  [yelling]  [Charges at the Muscular Robber and knocks him into the Skinny Robber. Uses SpongeBob to tie them up, then tosses them through the ceiling and into a police car]
Mr. Krabs: Good work, boy!
SpongeBob: You, too, sir!
Bill: [The crowd starts claping] clearly I  misjudged you are both brave citizens and for that, on behalf of the mint I would like to present you both brand new extremely fine limited-run dollar bills with your faces on them.
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Oooooo...
Bill: [Gives them their dollars]
SpongeBob: Wow! It's-
Mr. Krabs: [Takes it] Mine! I haven't charged you yet for tagging along on me vacation!
Pearl: (takes dollars from Mr. Krabs) And I haven't charged you yet for taking me on this terrible vacation. Here's the two dollars I was short on those shoes. I must've maxed out daddy's credit card. (give dollars to clerk, and takes shoes) Yay, shoes!
Mr. Krabs: [Starts to cry] Shoes?
SpongeBob: Oh no... [Puts on rain clothes]
Mr. Krabs: [Bursts out bawling]
[The episode ends with the Bikini Bottom Mint spraying out Mr. Krabs' tears]


[At Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
Mr. Fitz: Morning, Mrs. Puff. I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know, your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusually large amount of failings from this classroom.
Mrs. Puff: That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class.
Mr. Fitz: Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times. [shows folder with a bunch of files]
Mrs. Puff: You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable.
Mr. Fitz: We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher.
SpongeBob: Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?
Mr. Fitz: Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced.
Mrs. Puff: [in the boat with SpongeBob and Mr. Fitz] Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating?
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Seat-belt-aroony. One second. [gets tangled in seat-belt then squeezes self through. Mr. Fitz writes on his notepad]
Mrs. Puff: Then what do you do?
SpongeBob: Start the engine?
Mrs. Puff: Yes.
SpongeBob: [starts the boat] Now what do I do?
Mrs. Puff: Drive the boat. [SpongeBob drives into a boat]
SpongeBob: Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you failed.
SpongeBob: I failed?
Mr. Fitz: It's not you that failed, SpongeBob. It's Mrs. Puff that's failed you. You are relieved of your teaching duties.
Mrs. Puff: I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore? [starts laughing louder and louder] No more... SpongeBob?! I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life. [flies away] Free at last! Free at last!
SpongeBob: [in classroom] I got Mrs. Puff fired. [banging and crashing]
Roderick: Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor. [he smashes Mrs. Puff's nameplate] No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking.
Nat: Does that mean... [Roderick throws Nat through the door]
Roderick: Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon? [All the students keep silent]
Monroe: Uhh, I'll eat one. [all gasp. Monroe walks to Roderick]
Roderick: Pick your favorite. [Monroe takes one and eats it] How's it taste?
Monroe: It's a delightful taste sensation.
Roderick: No eating in my classroom! [throws Monroe through another door] Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class... [everyone but SpongeBob run out] Looks like you're the man, Sponge.
SpongeBob: I am?
Roderick: [outside] Do you wanna learn how to drive or what?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive [jumps in the boat]
Roderick: What do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob: Ready for my test, sir.
Roderick: [takes SpongeBob out of the boat] You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first. [shows roads will all sorts of obstacles] This is [the] most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it.
SpongeBob: Crawl?
Roderick: Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. [SpongeBob crawls forward]
SpongeBob: Left turn. [turns left] Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!
Roderick: Keep your eyes on the road, cadet.
SpongeBob: Pebble! [crawls faster and more out of control. Gets the pebble stuck in his hand and goes on screaming] Oh whoa! [SpongeBob's butt gets setted on fire rolls down the obstacle course then into the air, out of the water, then back down where the instructor catches him as he screams] Oh whoa! [he stops screaming] Whew! [falls with only his arm taken off]
Roderick: I'm ashamed of you, cadet. [removes the pebble from SpongeBob's hand] Tripped up by a wee pebble. [crushes the pebble] What are you suppose to be learning in my class?
SpongeBob: How to drive, sir?
Roderick: Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl. Then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl. [bends SpongeBob's arm] I want you to crawl! [puts SpongeBob's arm back]
SpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir!
Roderick: Now get out there! [SpongeBob crawls around a hole then his instructor takes off his shoes and socks; he wiggles his toes after his shoes are forcibly taken off, and carries the instructor on his back. Then he stops at a stop sign, and runs in and out of some radioactive waste] Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out. [hands SpongeBob a wrench] Here, go take that boat apart. [SpongeBob takes the boat apart] I'm impressed, son. Put it back together again!
SpongeBob: [laughs] That'll be easy.
Roderick: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh... [laughs] I might need a couple minutes. [later, the instructor is sleeping] It's ready, sarge! [SpongeBob has re-assembled the boat into a rocket ship.]
Roderick: Jumpin' jellyfish... [the rocket blasts off]
SpongeBob: Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians! [crashes through a lot of pedestrians] So, umm, how'd I do?
Roderick: How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... HOW YOU DID!
SpongeBob: Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?
Roderick: Not quite. [puts blindfold on SpongeBob] Now do it blindfolded.
[SpongeBob crashes through another pedestrian off-screen.]
Narrator: Several days later...
SpongeBob: 1003, 1004, 1005. [stops] Ooh, pebble #143. [steps over pebble] Ha! You will not trip me up again, pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008. [old lady pedestrian pops up] Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13.
Roderick: Congratulations. You're ready to get behind the wheel.
SpongeBob: Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm... [runs into a pole]
Roderick: [now in boat] Let's see what I taught you, laddy.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [drives boat] Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball. [SpongeBob continues] Nice boy.
Roderick: Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead. [SpongeBob parallel parks] Very good. [now at real exam] Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts. [puts on seatbelt with no problem]
Roderick: Excellent work, cadet. What's next?
SpongeBob: Step 2 would be... ignite engine.
Roderick: Step 3?
SpongeBob: Step 3 would be... [takes out blindfold and his eyes shrink] ...engage blindfold.
Roderick: What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal.
SpongeBob: But I can't do it without a blindfold.
Roderick: Drive, boy! Drive!
[SpongeBob kicks down on the gas pedal and the boat is off. At the first turn is a giant red canister labeled "GAS". SpongeBob fails to make the right turn and instead crashes right into the gas can, obliterating the boating school faculty in a mushroom-radius explosion, and sending debris from the boating school sign, etc., flying everywhere. As the debris begins to clear, the boat flies into the air and goes soaring.]
Roderick: Mayday! Mayday! You're off course. [boat drives into 2 buildings then underground. Spurts out from a fire hydrant. Then crashes through a bakery and into a field where Mrs. Puff is painting the scenery]
Mrs. Puff: Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff notices the boat and attempts to paint something really quick. When boat runs into her, the painting shows SpongeBob, the instructor, and Mr. Fitz fearing their lives]
Roderick: The brake son!
SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir. [takes brake apart] There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts.
Roderick: I'm gonna stop this thing. Tell my wife I love her. [jumps in front of the boat in an attempt to stop it] Come get some! [boat runs over him]
SpongeBob: Man down. Man down. [SpongeBob drives into the city and into each building] Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now. [boat drives out of the now destroyed city, and then cuts to SpongeBob driving while wearing Patrick's pants over his eyes] I can't see! I can't see!
Patrick: My pants!
SpongeBob: Hey, I can't see! [dodges traffic and pedestrians as Mrs. Puff screams. Parallel parks] Did I pass?
Mr. Fitz: Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have.
Patrick: [takes pants off SpongeBob's head] The nerve of some people.
Mr. Fitz: Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again. Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again.
SpongeBob: [at boating school] Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm "unteachable".
Mrs. Puff: It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back. [sniffles, holds up a burnt, charred object] And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion, [voice breaking] so it's as if you never failed.
SpongeBob: I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff. [shows name tag] I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time.
[Mrs. Puff puts her head down on her desk and begins to sob quietly, and the name tag shatters as the episode ends.]


[In SpongeBob's house, he is looking at himself in the mirror trying to look strong]
SpongeBob: It's time to grow myself large and wide.
[He grows himself large and wide as he is saying it. Walks over to his weight, which is a pink bunny and a blue bear and has trouble lifting it, but manages to get it over his head anyway. The doorbell rings and SpongeBob opens door]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?
SpongeBob: Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumpin' iron. Check it out. [shows off his muscles, but is still a weakling]
Sandy: Well, you're smelly.
SpongeBob: All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. [shows all sorts of stuffed animals]
Sandy: Uhh... I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob, but you won't see any progress with those.
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Sandy: That is, if you want arms like these... [rolls up right sleeve, and flexes her right arm, showing off a big, impressive bicep] ...or these... [rolls up other sleeve and flexes left arm, revealing her other bicep] ...or these! [shows off her powerful back muscles while executing a back double bicep flex. SpongeBob's arm wiggles in the air]
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.
Sandy: Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? That'd be great, Sandy. I can see me now. [imagines himself with muscles and very tall working at the Krusty Krab, then he is jellyfishing at Jellyfish Fields] La-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la. [at night, SpongeBob seems too big for his bed] Goodnight, Gary.
Gary: Meow. [cut back to the present]
SpongeBob: Yeah... that would change everything!
Sandy: Be at my place at 5 a.m. Oh! And you'll need a water helmet. [puts a fish bowl on his head. Now the scene cuts to Sandy's tree dome, where SpongeBob is trying to do push-ups] Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups! Come on. Come on! You can do it! [SpongeBob is grunting at this point determined to get a push-up. His body cracks and falls down while his arms stay up]
SpongeBob: One. [acorn bell dings]
Sandy: [in boxing ring with gloves on] Alright, put 'em up!
SpongeBob: [struggles getting his gloves up] They're up.
Sandy: Ding ding! [punches SpongeBob out of the ring. Later, Sandy starts up her exercise wheel with SpongeBob on it. SpongeBob pants while the wheel goes faster and makes him trip all over the wheel] Feeling the burn?
SpongeBob: I'm! Fee!! Ling!!! Some!!!! Thing!!!!! [launches out of the wheel and into the tree dome glass]
Sandy: Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm-cruncher.
SpongeBob: Arm-cruncher, great... [looks over and sees two cement blocks slamming into the cement pedestal] This squirrel's trying to kill me.
Sandy: [walks up to the arm-cruncher with phone in hand] This is it.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's great, Sandy, well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye. [hangs up] This working-out thing, isn't working out. [arms bulge in and out] Ow. Ow. Ow.
Shark: [on TV] Hey! Hey, you! Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! "Oh, I'm a little peanut worm." Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Shark: With Anchor arms! [puts a long pink blow-up item on his arm] They slip on like a glove. Just add air. [puts a plug in the arm's hole and pumps air into it] How big do you want 'em? [pumps air into other arm] Normal? [puts more air into arm] Veiny!? And for the ladies... [puts air into arm which makes it grow hair] ...hairy. [SpongeBob whistles as the TV puts up an image of a weak shark] I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk, and everybody loves me! So order now, wimp!
SpongeBob: Wow, now that's a good idea!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone! [later, a big shadow of SpongeBob is walking down the road past Squidward, who is licking a popsicle] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [Tongue stuck to popsicle while looking up.] SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: [Next scene is Mr. Krabs sweeping the outside of the Krusty Krab. He looks up.] Huh!?
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!!
Mr. Krabs: Mother of pearl! [hides in the Krusty Krab. Now, at Mussel Beach where everyone is lifting weights. SpongeBob comes in and makes one guy drop a big weight on two others' feet]
Fish: Owww...
SpongeBob: Hi, guys. [shows off new muscles]
Larry: SpongeBob, is that you!?
SpongeBob: [walking on his hands] Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait... wait... [flexes those muscles] They're big, aren't they?
Larry: Dude, you're ripped!
SpongeBob: [flexes out the words...] THANK YOU. I've been working out. Excuse me a second. [flexes more] Yeah. Anyone up for the... [flexes muscles into drinks] ...juice bar? [bubble transition to juice bar]
Scooter: I'm tellin' ya, he's huge!
Sandy: Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?
Scooter: You mean 'MuscleBob BuffPants'? He's in there! [points to inside of bar]
Sandy: Uhh, whatever. Thanks.
SpongeBob: [now inside]I start off with twenty raw eggs everyday. But that's just me.
Sandy: Pardon me.
SpongeBob: Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there! [points to weak fish]
Fish: Who, me? [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: I remember when I used to look like you, too. [points to Larry and laughs] But, that was a long time ago.
Bartender: Here's your drink, sir.
SpongeBob: Thank you. [tries to lift up drink but can't so he stretches his mouth out to the straw and drinks] Yeah...
Sandy: SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?
SpongeBob: I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results. [anchor arm almost slips off] Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better.
Sandy: Heck, what's your secret?
SpongeBob: What?
Sandy: Your secret workout. What is it? [everyone wants to know and looks over at SpongeBob. SpongeBob thinks of something nervously and quickly.]
SpongeBob: Hmmm... well... I, uhh... first I... take my hand... and I do this. [makes armpit noises]
Larry: Are you kidding?
SpongeBob: Do these muscles lie? [flexes muscles into a shape of a sponge. Everyone starts making armpit noises]
Sandy: I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you.
SpongeBob: Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.
Sandy: Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test.
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you mean?
Sandy: The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today! Everybody'll be there!
Bartender: Here's your drink. [sets drink on SpongeBob's anchor-arm hand and it sinks down]
Sandy: Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!
SpongeBob: Uhh, well, I'm not sure.
Sandy: C'mon, let's go.
SpongeBob: Right now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a... [tries to run away but the drink is holding him back. Tries lifting the drink but is unsuccessful] Sandy, wait!
Sandy: Here it is-- the sign-in list.
SpongeBob: Oh, no.
Sandy: [signs her name on a piece of paper] Okay, Sannnndy... Cheeks. [puts the paper into entry box]
SpongeBob: [still struggling] Wait, Sandy... don't sign just yet!
[Sandy puts the paper in the box]
SpongeBob: Wait-!
Sandy: Okay...
SpongeBob: [struggles even harder] WAAAAIT!
Sandy: [signs names] SpongeBobbbb SquaaaarePaaaants. [the bartender lifts the drink off of SpongeBob, which sends him flying towards Sandy]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait...! [slams into pole]
Sandy: It's okay, SpongeBob, I already signed your name in.
SpongeBob: Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy. [at the competition]
Announcer: We on? Welcome to the Goo Lagoon 8th annual anchor toss competition. [everyone is getting ready but SpongeBob is nervous]
Sandy: Ready, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Great. No problem. [blows frantically into his Anchor Arms]
Announcer: Could I get some mustard on that? Oh. First up, Don the Whale. [Don throws the anchor and it lands. A measurer fish dashes up to measure distance]
Measurer: 200 yards! [the crowd cheers]
Announcer: Let's see an instant-replay. [another anchor comes flying in on top of the measurer and hits him.] Amazing! Up next, Larry the Lobster. [Larry throws his anchor. The measurer shrieks at the incoming anchor, and runs aside from getting hit; however, the anchor's shadow covers the measurer and crushes him once again]
Measurer: 210 yards!!
Announcer: Here goes, Sandy Cheeks. [Sandy throws it up in the air and kicks it away. The measurer runs around, trying to avoid getting hit by the anchor, but the anchor crushes him anyway]
Measurer: 510 yaaaards!!!
Announcer: Wow! Fabulous!
Sandy: Beat that, SpongeBob!
Announcer: Up next: SpongeBob SquarePants!
Crowd: [imitating the armpit exercise while others are holding up SpongeBob signs and chanting] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tries to pull the anchor but instead he falls under the ground with the anchor and comes out and laughs] Just kidding. Just kidding... heh! [everyone laughs]
Sandy: That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn!
SpongeBob: [to himself] Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp! I'm a jerk!!
[SpongeBob blows his Anchor Arms over the "JERK" size]
SpongeBob: [the crowd goes berserk in cheering] Yeah.
[SpongeBob tries to lift the anchor again but when he tries too hard, some of the air in one arm goes into SpongeBob's nose. Tries to lift again, but the air goes into his left eye as the crowd "ooh"s. SpongeBob tries to lift again and causes the air to go into his left tooth]
Crowd: [chanting] SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob tries to lift again the last time, causing the Anchor Arms to burst around his body, then explode. After the air blows off, the popped Anchor Arms deflate, floating down.]
Crowd Attendee: Ooh, I think he lost. [crowd chants for Sandy] Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! [SpongeBob then reveals his real arms hidden from inside his body. Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and taps her foot, disappointed. SpongeBob walks away, leaving his destroyed Anchor Arms on the ground and follows Sandy to the Treedome]
SpongeBob: 96... 97... 98... 99... 100.
Sandy: I want 100 more.
SpongeBob: It hurts. [changes channel over and over] 1. 2. 3. 4...
Sandy: I think we finally found an exercise for you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: ...9. 10. [his arm falls off] Can you get that?


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. A mother and a baby passes by and is greeted by a polite gentleman. A raspberry noise is heard. The mother turns and gives the gentleman an angry look, thinking it was him who made the noise. The noise is heard again. They turn and see a long line standing in the Krusty Krab. It turns out to be Mustard Day and SpongeBob is giving away mustard to the customers.]
SpongeBob: Mustard, mustard, step right up for your mustard! [flips the mustard container] Some mustard for you. Eh, eh, eh. [sprays mustard on a little boy's Krabby Patty]
[The mustard forms into a t-rex and it roars mustard in the boy's face.]
Boy: [his face is covered in mustard] Cool!
SpongeBob: [flips the mustard container] A bit of the yellow for you. Doy. [sprays mustard on Frankie Billy's Krabby Patty]
[The mustard forms into a sailboat. It whistles and rings its foghorn before it melts onto the patty. Frankie Billy laughs and skips away. Nancy Suzy Fish comes up and whispers something in SpongeBob's ear.]
SpongeBob: Oh, okay. [winks at Nancy Suzy Fish] Eh. [hops and spins the mustard container before spraying the mustard into a handsome man] And a Mr. Mustard for you.
Nancy Suzy Fish: [purrs as walks with her Mr. Mustard while licking him] Mmm, yummy.
SpongeBob: Hyah! [attempts to give mustard to Frank, but the mustard container is all out and it cough out a small drop of mustard]
Customers: Aw.
SpongeBob: Hang on, folks, I'll be right back with more mustard. [hops on the mustard container and drives on it like a car] Whoo! [drives to the kitchen and goes to the condiment cabinet] Let's see. Ketchup. [slides ketchup door to mayonnaise door] Mayonnaise. [rolls up mayonnaise door to mustard door] Oh, mustard. [opens doors mustard door to find Mr. Krabs in it]
Mr. Krabs: Did you use up all me mustard?
SpongeBob: [stammering nervously] What?
Squidward: [filing his tentacle] Oh, who gives a flying fish about mustard?
SpongeBob: [gasps] But Squidward, without mustard I wouldn't be able to make a—
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patty! That's right, you're both hereby ordered to go down into the mustard mines! And bring me back more mustard!
Squidward: Mustard mines?
Patrick: [comes out of the condiment cabinet and is covered with mustard] Mmm, mustard. [takes a container off his head and grabs a packet of mustard] Uh... Ah. [squirts mustard in his mouth, eats it and burps]
Mr. Krabs: [wipes mustard off his face] And you are going down to the mustard mines too.
Walter Haddock: [offscreen] I wouldn't do that if I was you. [creepily comes in and spits on the grill]
[SpongeBob wipes the grill clean.]
Walter Haddock: That old mustard mine is cursed.
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs in fear] Cursed?
Mr. Krabs: [pushes SpongeBob away] What kind of curse?
Walter Haddock: It's, uh, er, one of those—The Mummy's Curse.
Mr. Krabs: [snickers] There's no such thing as mummies.
Walter Haddock: [holds up a creepy picture of his mother] We've all got mummies. Eh? [giggles] Mm-hmm. I've been in that mine. No one that enters gets out alive. [makes a creepy smile as a shrieking noise is heard; a spider crawls into his mouth and thunder claps]
SpongeBob: You got out and you're alive.
Walter Haddock: Ah, but am I?
Patrick: Yeah, you're standing right there.
Walter Haddock: But am I? [walks away in a creepy fashion]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, you're right—[notices that he's gone, but he sees his foot] Hmm.
Squidward: I see your foot.
Walter Haddock: [slides his foot back] No, you don't.
SpongeBob: Ah, his foot's gone!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward at the entrance to the mustard mines.]
Squidward: [looks at the map] This map doesn't show us where the mustard vein is located. Well, let's just start picking.
Patrick: [picking his nose] Way ahead of you, pal.
Squidward: Ugh. [turns and looks at the map again]
[Patrick reaches into his nostril and picks out his brain.]
Patrick: Ooh. [smears his brain on Squidward's shirt]
[Squidward turns and grunts in disgust. Patrick gets scared and runs over to SpongeBob. Squidward picks up his pickaxe and heads into the mustard mines.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasps and skips into the mines] ♪Oh, a-mining we will go! The mustard, it will flow! [bounce up and down really hard] With pick and axe without the facts! There's nothing that we know! Ta-da!♪
[SpongeBob and Patrick's violent bouncing causes a landslide and falling rocks seals off the entrance, much to their horror.]
Squidward: [Shocked and angry] Huh?! You nitwits! How will we get out now?
[SpongeBob and Patrick's realize their mistake as Patrick gets worried.]
Patrick: Ah, we're trapped in a mine! We'll never get out!
[Patrick goes into frantic panic and runs up and down the mine walls. He curls in a fetal position and acts crazy. He punches his chest and passes out.]
Squidward: [sighs and goes to check on Patrick] Krabby Patty, stat.
[SpongeBob takes out the ingredients and makes a perfect Krabby Patty. He gives it to Squidward and he feeds Patrick the patty. Patrick swallows the patty and slowly wakes up.]
Squidward: He's coming 'round.
Patrick: [weakly] Squidward. I—I need—
Squidward: What can I get for you?
Patrick: [pulls out the Krabby Patty from his mouth and stupidly] I need a little mustard for the Krabby Patty.
Squidward: [drops Patrick down in disgust at his idiocy] Why do I even bother? Maybe there's a back door.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, wait for us!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run over to Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Whoa.
[They stop at a long, deep shaft.]
Squidward: I wonder how deep it is.
SpongeBob: I'll check. [picks up a pebble, goes over the edge and falls into the shaft] Wahhh! [appears next to Squidward and Patrick] Don't bother jumping. That shaft has no bottom. Let's take the escalator.
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick aside] All right, spread out! [goes on the escalator]
[SpongeBob and Patrick follow and go on the escalator with Squidward. They see coal miners go up the escalator.]
SpongeBob: Coal miners.
[They see sulfur miners go up the escalator. The awful smell from the sulfur makes SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward cover their noses.]
SpongeBob: Ew.
Patrick: Sulfur miners.
SpongeBob: Phew.
[They see a group of kids go up the escalator.]
SpongeBob: Unaccompanied minors. [drum sting]
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward walk off the escalator.]
Squidward: All right, let's get to work, chowderheads.
[They go in separate directions while bumping into each other for a little bit. SpongeBob digs up a yellow rock with his pickaxe.]
SpongeBob: Hey, I found something yellow. [pulls the yellow rock out of the wall; he was happy at first, but turned sad] Never mind, it's just gold. [throws it away]
Patrick: All I'm getting is dumb old diamonds. [throws and kicks several diamonds]
SpongeBob: [carrying a handful of gold nuggets] This must be the Mummy's Curse that old guy was talking about. [throws the gold nuggets in the stalagmite]
Squidward: Gold and diamonds? [digs up sand from the wall] Gold dust! No, no, it's just sand.
[Up above the surface, Ryan is minding his own business playing in the sandbox. Suddenly, the sand begins to form a whirlpool and sucks Ryan down underneath.]
Ryan: Whoa! [screaming]
[Ryan comes out from the hole Squidward dug up and he runs around in panic.]
Squidward: [upon seeing Ryan] Ah.
[Ryan continues to run and scream in panic until he calms down when he goes up the escalator.]
Squidward: Uh, what was that?
SpongeBob: [sighs] The greatest treasure of all, a child.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward resume their task. All of a sudden, SpongeBob begins to sniff out something. He sniffs the wall and punctures a hole on it with the pickaxe. It turns out that he dug up a payphone underneath the wall. The phone rings and SpongeBob answers it.]
SpongeBob: Hello?
Mr. Krabs: [with angry customers yelling in the background] SpongeBob, where's me mustard?
Jennifer Millie: I want some mus—[Mr. Krabs pushes her away with his foot]
SpongeBob: On the way, sir, as soon was we find it. [hangs up but answers again] Love you. [hangs up again]
Squidward: Oh, we'll never find that mustard vein. [pokes the wall with the pickaxe and the wall crumbles into a hole, leading him to the subway] Oh, what is this? [wonders around the subway]
Subway PA: Local train approaching station.
[Deep in the tunnel, a train emerges and stops in front of Squidward. The train opens its doors, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick already on board. Squidward stares at them in shock, wondering how they managed to get on so quick and afford a train ride.]
SpongeBob: Hurry up, Squidward, before the doors close!
Patrick: It's the last train of the night!
SpongeBob: Do you have a metro card?
[Squidward frantically searches for a metro card until he finds one under his shirt.]
Squidward: Ah! I got it! [tries to scan his card, but the tumblers keep beeping red]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward!
[Squidward tries all his might to scan his card as he watches the train doors slowly close in horror.]
Subway PA: Watch the closing doors.
[Squidward buffs up his arm and the tumbler finally turns green, approving access to it. Squidward runs through the tumblers and frantically heads to the train.]
SpongeBob: Faster, Squidward, faster!
[Squidward makes it, but the doors close on his neck, leaving his body being dragged outside of the moving train.]
Patrick: Hey, Squidward, you really should watch the closing doors.
[Squidward growls and hisses at Patrick in complete anger and frustration, as Patrick backs away.]
Subway PA: This is a local mining train making all stops between Coal and Limestone. Next stop, Condiments.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's our stop.
[The train stops at the condiments vein. The doors open. SpongeBob steps over a battened Squidward and heads to the condiments vein. Patrick runs out and steps on Squidward, but grabs him by the feet.]
Patrick: Come on, Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Patrick scurry into the condiments vein while Squidward, being carried by Patrick, hits his head on the sign. Patrick sets Squidward down. Squidward walks around in a dizzy fashion, but pulls himself together. Squidward knocks on the wall and punctures a hole with his pickaxe. Mayonnaise comes out of the wall and sprays into Squidward's face.]
Squidward: Hmm. [sticks out his tongue] Ah, la, hmm. [licks the mayo] Ah! I've struck mayo!
[SpongeBob punctures a hole on a different wall and a drop of hot sauce flies onto his tongue. He tastes the dropping and his body flares up, burning himself to a crisp.]
SpongeBob: Hot sauce. [his body crumbles into ashes]
[Patrick goes to puncture a wall with his pickaxe, but flips over and falls to the ground; his pickaxe punctures a hole on the wall and ketchup spews out.]
Patrick: I struck blood! [grabs some of the ketchup and tastes it] Oh, no, it's ketchup! [slurps some more]
SpongeBob: We're getting close. [punctures a hole on the ground and mustard comes out; he takes a sample of mustard] Oh. [licks the mustard] Mustard. Ahhh! I struck mustard!
Squidward: Mustard?
Patrick: Mustard?
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: [dancing around in circles while twisting SpongeBob's body] ♪Look at all the mustard flow! Look at all the mustard flow! That golden yellow fatty acid treat!♪
[SpongeBob unravels himself, sending Squidward and Patrick flying to another wall. SpongeBob warms himself up and goes to crack open the ground again. But the ground was so thick that is disintegrates his pickaxe.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no, what are we gonna do now?
Squidward: I think we better use our heads.
Patrick: Let's use my head. [pulls his tongue and his pointy head revs up like a power drill]
[SpongeBob and Squidward go to use Patrick's drilling head to drill a hole in the ground. When all of a sudden, they hear a moaning sound. Smoke fumes around the tunnels and a shadowy creature appears.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: The mummy!
[The smoke clears and the shadowy figure reveals himself to be none other than the crazy old prospector, Walter Haddock.]
Walter Haddock: Stop!
[Walter Haddock leaps in front of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, pulls a cork out from his mouth and plugs up the hole in the ground.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] It's the Mummy's Curse guy!
Walter Haddock: There ain't no curse! I just tried to discourage you chuckleheads from mining this mustard!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it, 'cause the mummy wants the mustard. Mystery solved.
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward: Hurrah!
Walter Haddock: [twitches his eye] 'Tain't no mummy! This mustard is sitting on top of 20 million pounds of pressure! If you open her up, she's gonna blow sky high!
SpongeBob: Oh, no curse. No mummy. And no mustard. [sniffs] And I'll have to find another job! [cries and blows his nose on Squidward's nose]
Squidward: [pulls his nose back] Stop. Don't you see? This old coot wants all the mustard for himself! Now uncork that mustard!
Walter Haddock: Hmm? [growls]
Squidward: Oh, put your fists down, old man. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Walter Haddock: Hyah! [punches Squidward in the face]
[Squidward falls over.]
SpongeBob: You were right, Squidward, you're not gonna hurt him.
Squidward: [gets up and is really angry] Why you— [gets punched in the face again] Ow! [gets punched again] I'm gonna— [gets punched and his head spins; then he gets punched again]
SpongeBob: Go, Squidward, you're winning! You're not hurting him at all!
Patrick: [buffs up] Let me try not hurting him. [grabs Squidward and throws him aside] Come on, old-timer! You know you want a piece of me! [Walter Haddock punches Patrick on the head and sends him flying and crashing onto the hole in the ground] Oh.
Walter Haddock: [in pain]Ow, that hurt!
Patrick: [Getting up] I hurt him! [Stupidly and disappointed] That means I lose.
[Suddenly, the ground underneath begins the shake, due to the force of Patrick's fall. Cracks begins to form and Walter Haddock dodges the incoming stalagmites from the ground. The mustard from underground begins to build up pressure and is about to erupt.]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! [tries to hold down the pressure, but the mustard begins to fill up inside his body] Whoa....!
Walter Haddock: Adiós, muchachos!
[Walter Haddock laughs manically and bounces around until he calms down when he goes up the elevator. Cracks form underneath Squidward and the crack uncovers a payphone next to him.]
Squidward: Hmm. [phone rings and he answers it] I'll get it. Hello.
Mr. Krabs: [on a mast above the angry customers] Where's me mustard?!
Squidward: Um...
[Pressure builds up as SpongeBob's body grows bigger and bigger from the upcoming mustard. Patrick tries his best by corking up the holes. At the Krusty Krab, the customers continue to riot against Mr. Krabs. One customer is chopping the mast down with his axe. The screen zooms out to reveal volcanic pocket of mustard underneath the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: Your mustard is coming right up.
Mr. Krabs: [as the mast falls] When?!
Squidward: Now?
[SpongeBob can't hold the pressure much longer as his eyes fill up with mustard. The ground under the Krusty Krab rumbles and erupts a geyser of mustard through the roof. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce up and down on top of the geyser.]
SpongeBob: Wow! Yee-ha! Yeah!
[The mustard fills up the Krusty Krab inside. The customers are now satisfied and go to swim around in the mustard as well as eat their patties with mustard. Among them stands a mummy, who is unimpressed.]
Mummy: What, no relish?


Note: The instances of "My leg" are all numbered in this order:

[The episode begins with a television fuzzing on the screen. The screen starts at Mrs. Puff's Boating School. SpongeBob backs the boat against the lighthouse and Mrs. Puff inflates herself. The lighthouse knocks over and falls onto Fred's leg.]
Fred: My leg! (1) (1) [gets hit by antenna; the screen then shows Fred at the circus, where he is run over by an old man's stroller and crushes his leg in the process] Ah! My leg! (2) (2) [the screen then shows Fred doing weight lifting, where the weights crush his legs] My leg! (3) (3) [the screen then shows Fred fishing out his leg] Hmm? My leg! (4) (4) [the screen then shows Fred being part of Charlie's magic show, where his leg is detached] My leg!

(10) (10) [the screen then shows Fred being served as a dinner entrée to a hungry human at a restaurant] My leg! (11) (11) [the screen then shows Fred's leg being zapped by a mad scientist; he whimpers] My leg! (12) (12)
[Finally, the screen shows Fred sitting in the fields next to a coral tree. A leaf floats down on his leg and it disintegrates into dust.]
Doctor: [chuckles] That last one put my daughter through college. [Fred growls at him] All right, let's get this over with. [holds out a really big spinning blade]
Fred: [gasps and the doctor saws his cast] My leg, (13) (13) my leg, (14) (14) my leg, (15) (15) my leg, (16) (16) my leg! (17) (17) MY LEEEEEEEEG!!! (18) (18)  [the cast comes apart] Ooh, hmm! Feels great! Thanks, Doc! [accidentally kicks the doctor's face]
Doctor: I'm glad, Fred. But you've got to be more careful with... [pulls down an x-ray of Fred's leg] your leg! (19) [rolls the x-ray back up]
Fred: Ah, come on, Doc. It's just my leg! (20) (19) [accidentally kicks the doctor out the window] I've got another one.
Doctor: Just your leg? (21) [climbs back in through the window, grabs Fred's leg and whacks Fred in the face] JUST YOUR LEG?! (22) [lets go of Fred's leg] All right, Fred, the next time you come in here with a hurt leg (23), I'm going to replace it with... [opens cabinet]
Fred: With what?
Doctor: [holds up a robotic leg] A ROBOT LEG! (24)
Fred: Cool!
Doctor: It might be cool to you, Fred, but how does the robot feel about it? [pulls out a robot and it grabs Fred]
Tom (robot): Don't take my leg! (25) (20) Don't take my leg! (26) (21) [sobs]
Fred: [pulls the robot off him] Okay, Doc, I get it. I'll take better care of my leg! (27) (22) I promise. [leaves]
Doctor: Nice job, Tom.
[The doctor and Tom, the robot, give each other a high-five. The scene changes to Fred exiting the hospital, where he meets up with SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [holding flowers and a balloon] Hello, Fred. Your leg! (28) Looks great.
Fred: Stay away from my leg! (29) (23) SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, Fred, I'm so sorry I drove that freight train onto your leg! (30)
[The scene changes into a flashback. Fred is stretching his leg out onto the railroad will sipping down a drink. Suddenly, SpongeBob comes rolling by the tracks on a small freight train laughing, running over Fred's leg.]
SpongeBob: [weakly] Heh, choo-choo...
Fred: My LEG! (31) (24)
[An ambulance drives by. The paramedics pick up Fred and drive him away to the hospital. The flashback ends and SpongeBob squiggles his body.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Flashbacks tickle.
[Fred ties a balloon around SpongeBob.]
Fred: Now please go away. [blows SpongeBob away and leaves]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know. I'll protect his leg! (32) From harm, incognito.
[SpongeBob pulls on the string, pops the balloon and flies into a nearby trashcan. He sees Fred is going to step in the oil puddle. He jumps out and falls flat onto the oil puddle so Fred wouldn't slip on it.]
SpongeBob: [as Fred steps on him] Ow, ow.
[SpongeBob, now covered in oil, gets up and sees Fred is going to slip on a banana peel. He slides underneath him and eats the banana peel. Fred is about to step on a pile of sea urchins. SpongeBob slides underneath him and shields him from the pointy spikes. SpongeBob sticks out his tongue and its covered with sea urchins. He sees Fred about to step on a foothold trap. SpongeBob steps in and gets into the trap to prevent Fred from stepping in it.]
SpongeBob: Yowch! [groans]
[SpongeBob continues to follow Fred and hops over to the place he works at: A construction factory.]
Fred: Hey, everybody! Look who's back!
Construction workers: "My leg!" (33) (25)
[As Fred goes to begin his job, SpongeBob, who is shaped like Fred, continues to follow him. He hides behind the drilling machine just as Fred is preparing to work. Fred begins his job by pushing logs through the drilling machine.]
SpongeBob: [rips himself in half] This is his job?! Oh no. Not safe. Must think. [puts on a fake mustache and construction helmet; talks in a deep voice] Welcome back, Fred. Nice leg (34) work. But you know, it's a lot safer if you use a...[pulls out a table leg] table leg (35) instead.
Fred: Wow! Really?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Now Fred, I wouldn't pull your leg! (36) Watch this. [pushes the log in the drilling machine, but ends up getting caught in the blades] Huh?
[With SpongeBob jamming the machine, it starts to overload and the construction workers flee the factory. The factory unleashes a devastating explosion. The smoke clears and SpongeBob pops out from the debris.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Well, at least Fred's leg! (37) is safe. [collapse on the ground; as he collapsed, he is cut into several pieces of wood]
[The scene changes to Fred receiving therapy from a octopus named Dr. Charley Horse.]
Fred: My leg! (38) (26) Is really stressing out, Dr. Charley Horse.
Dr. Charley Horse: [examining Fred's leg] Hmm. Uh-huh. [twists Fred's leg and bite it] You're right, Fred. It's so tense. But I've got just the remedy. Take off your shoes and follow me.
[Fred takes off his shoes and follows Dr. Charley Horse. SpongeBob and Patrick pop out of Fred's shoes.]
Patrick: [wearing a gas mask] So far this plan stinks.
SpongeBob: This is no time to be smelling stinks, Patrick. I need to protect Fred's leg! (39) And I can't do it alone.
Dr. Charley Horse: The only way to relax your leg! (40) Is to walk on... [removes the rug and reveals a patch of burning, hot coals underneath] hot coals.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hot coals?!
[SpongeBob goes to protect Fred while Patrick hides in a sock.]
Dr. Charley Horse: Now Fred, close your eyes, and repeat after me the ancient mantra: My feet (41) are cold. My feet (42) are cold.
Fred and Dr. Charley Horse: My feet (43) are cold.
Fred: My feet (44) are cold. [stretches his foot out over the hot coals]
[SpongeBob gasps and lays himself underneath Fred's feet as he prepares to walk on the hot coals.]
Fred: My feet (45) are cold. [walks on top of SpongeBob as he burns] My feet (46) are cold.
SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Fred: My feet (47) are cold.
[Fred makes it to the other end of the hot coals. SpongeBob hops out screaming in pain as his body is on fire. He flies around Fred.]
Fred: Whoa! [falls on the hot coals] MY BUTT! (48)
[SpongeBob flies around Dr. Charley Horse, accidentally making him step on the hot coals.]
Dr. Charley Horse: [his voice gets higher and starts to shrink as he walks on the hot coals] Oh my feet (49) are cold, my feet (50) are cold, my feet (51) are cold, my feet (52) are cold! [disappears; forms a word above the coals and whispers] Transcendence.
Fred: Oooohhhh!
[The scene changes to Fred walking in the streets in Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick appearance in disguises as bodyguards.]
SpongeBob: [imitates static] All quiet on the right side.
Patrick: [imitates static] All quiet on the left side. [bashes Bubble Bass out of the way] Sorry, sir.
[SpongeBob moves an old woman out of the way.]
Old woman: Oh!
SpongeBob: Sorry, ma'am.
Fred: Hey, what's going on here?
[A girl scout appears in front of them.]
Girl Scout: Would you like to buy some cookies?
SpongeBob: Mayday, Chicken Leg! (53) (41) We got a situation on the griddle! [wraps his body around Fred's leg]
Patrick: [grabs the box of cookies] I got the weapon! [the girl scout bites his leg] Yow!
[The girl scout brutally beats Patrick up and whacks him around on the ground while holding his leg with her teeth. She heavily pants like a wild savage beast until picks up the box and returns to her sweet innocent self. She skips away and Fred removes SpongeBob's sunglasses.]
Fred: SpongeBob? Why are you following MY LEG?! (54) (27)  (42) [pulls SpongeBob off his leg]
SpongeBob: Fred, you have to listen to me. Your leg! (55) (43) Is in constant danger. Isn't that so, Patrick?
Patrick: I think I hurt my leg... (56) (28)  (44) [shows the bite mark on his leg]
SpongeBob and Fred: Your what?
Patrick: [screams] MY LEG!! (57) (29) (45)
[An ambulance arrives. The paramedics grab Patrick, throw him in, and drive him away.]
Fred: [sobs] Aw gee, some guys get all the lucky breaks. [kicks an empty can in SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: [pulls the can off his face] At least you know that your leg's! (58) (46) Perimeter is secured.
Fred: I know. I just miss being at the hospital.
SpongeBob: Why?
Fred: Well, secretly...
SpongeBob: Ooh! [leans closer to listen]
Fred: [whispers] I'm in love with a nurse.
SpongeBob: Ooh, you're in love with a nurse? Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! [forms into a heart and sighs; a cupid arrow pops SpongeBob back to his normal form] Fred, I've got an idea. Why don't we hurt your leg! (59) (47) So you can be reunited with your lady fair?
Fred: Let's do it! And we should step on it. It's almost time for her break.
SpongeBob: I'd say it's almost time for your break.
[SpongeBob and Fred share a laugh. SpongeBob takes out a toy hammer and hits Fred's leg with it, but it didn't do any physical harm.]
SpongeBob: I should probably use something stronger.
Fred: Yeah, probably.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Fred climbing over the wall at Bikini Bottom Jail. SpongeBob taps the shoulder of a nearby convict working on the rocks.]
Convict: Hmm?
[Fred stretches out his leg and SpongeBob quietly explains to the convict to hit it with his hammer.]
SpongeBob: Ahh?
Convict: Hmm? Mm-mm.
[SpongeBob grabs the hammer and goes to hit Fred's leg with it. But the hammer slips off his hand and it lands on the convict's foot. The screen becomes black and white and like a silent movie, the convict words "My Leg!" (60) (30) (48) appears on the screen when he screams. The ambulance arrives again. The paramedics climb out, throw the convict in, and drive away. SpongeBob and Fred snap their fingers in disgust. The scene changes to Fred and SpongeBob at Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob has three jellyfish in a net and battery chargers attached to it. He puts two other battery chargers on Fred's leg in attempt to have the jellyfish sting it.]
SpongeBob: [takes out a stick] Hmm. [pokes the net]
[The jellyfish come out of the net and repeatedly stings SpongeBob. SpongeBob comes back, now incredibly swollen, and snaps his finger in disgust. The scene changes to Fred sprinkling salt on his leg. SpongeBob rings the bell and the Alaskan Bull Worm appears. But instead of biting Fred's leg, it licks the salt off. Fred snaps his fingers in disgust. The scene changes to SpongeBob tying Fred's leg to the railroad tracks.]
SpongeBob: Trust me, Fred, your leg! (61) (49) Is as good as broken.
Fred: Oh, my sweet nurse angel. I'll be there soon, my love!
SpongeBob: And here comes the love train, right on schedule!
[A train with heart steaming out comes riding down the tracks. Just as the train gets closer, Tom the robot appears. Tom stops the train and throws it off the track.]
Tom (robot): Don't hurt your leg! (62) (50) Don't hurt your leg! (63) (51)
SpongeBob: Mr. Robot, that is very rude. How are we supposed to break Fred's leg! (64) (52) Now?
[Tom's head explodes in anger.]
Fred: He's just afraid if I hurt my LEG! (65) (31) (53) The doctor will replace it with his leg! (66) (54)
SpongeBob: Oh, is that all? Shucks, he can have my leg!  (67) (32) (55) It'll grow back. [pulls his left leg off] Boink! [sticks his leg on Tom] Enjoy.
Tom (robot): [laughing] Thank you, sponge man. This one is even better than my leg! (68) (33) (56)
[The ambulance arrives again. The paramedics climb out, throw Tom in, and float away.]
Fred: Aw, it's no use, SpongeBob. Maybe the nurse and me were never meant to be.
SpongeBob: Now, don't put your tail between your legs! (69) (57) Just yet, Fred. I've got the perfect plan to get you back to the hospital. Okay, here's what we do... [his left leg grows back, but it's smaller than normal] Heyyy! My leg! (70) (34) (58)
[The ambulance falls back down, crashing on top of Fred. The paramedics climb out, throw SpongeBob on the side, and drive away, leaving Fred with some tire marks.]
Fred: MY HEAD AND TORSO! (71) Wow, that's crazy. They hit me everywhere except MY LEGS! (72) (35) (59)
[The paramedics grab Fred and drive away. The scene changes to the hospital where SpongeBob, Patrick, the convict, and Tom the robot have their legs casted up. Fred, however, has his entire body casted up except for his legs.]
Fred: [sighs] Thank you, SpongeBob. If it wasn't for you, I never would have made it back to my angel goddess.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't thank me, Fred. Your leg! (73) (60) Did all the heavy lifting. I can't wait to meet this angel goddess of yours.
Fred: Well, wait no longer, SpongeBob. Hello, Nurse Bazooka!
SpongeBob: Nurse Bazooka?
[Fred's secret crush turns out to be a strong, bulky nurse named Nurse Bazooka. She enters the room with a wet sponge.]
Nurse Bazooka: Sponge bath time!
SpongeBob, Patrick, Convict, and Tom (robot): [all scared]No!
Patrick: [frantic]I don't want to! Oh, no, no! [cries]
Nurse Bazooka: ♪Scrub, scrub, scrubbity, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub♪ [grabs Patrick and violently scrubs him with the sponge]
Convict: No!
[Tom and the convict tremble in fear at the sight, but Fred doesn't seem to be afraid of her at all.]
Fred: You know, this reminds me of a song.
[Fred takes out a ukulele and begins to play music. Tom and the convict attempt to dig themselves out of the hospital to escape Nurse Bazooka, but eventually decides to join in the music. Fred saws his face out through the cast.]
Fred: ♪When I met you, my fingers went numb and my arms were all aloof. But I tripped over your heart. And now, my loneliness went poof. Becaaaaaause... my leg (74) (36) (61) is in love! Hey, my leg (75) (37) (62) is in love! Like an old, snug shoe that fits like a glove! My leg (76) (38) (63) is in love! Wow! My leg (77) (39) (64) is in love! Through my femur to the marrow is where Cupid shot an arrow! So, my leg (78) (40) (65) is in love! Whoa! My leg (79) (41) (66) is in love! My calves are getting restless! My quads are going crazy! I'm in love with a nurse and I think her name is Daisyyyyyy!♪
[Nurse Bazooka is wringing Patrick out with the wringer. She stops and starts listening to Fred's song about her.]
Nurse Bazooka: [blushes] Me?
Chorus: ♪His leg (80) (67) is in love! Yeah! His leg (81) (68) is in love!♪
Fred: ♪I really mean it! Yeah, my leg! (82) (42) (69)♪
Chorus: ♪His leg! (83) (70)♪
Fred: ♪Oh, yes!♪
Chorus: ♪Oh, yes!♪
Fred: ♪My le-eg (84) (43) (71) is in loooooovvvvve!♪
Chorus: ♪His leg (85) (72) is in love!♪
Fred: ♪Yeah!♪
SpongeBob: [as Cupid] Hey, I always wanted to show a little leg! (86) (73) [laughs]
Nurse Bazooka: [kisses Fred] Mwah, mwah, mwah.
[The screen closes and cuts Fred's leg off.]
Fred: [screaming] MY LEEEEEEEEEEEEEG!!! (87) (44) (74)
[The ambulance drives up. The paramedic takes Fred's leg and drives away, ending the episode.]


Narrator: Ah, springtime in Bikini Bottom. All sea creatures have an innate sense of the seasonal changes... [Patrick jumps out of his rock with a purple sweater on] ...like the starfish. A quick survey of his environment... [scratches his back] ...and he knows that...
Patrick: It's spring!
Narrator: The starfish then sheds his winter coat [takes his sweater off] and stores it away safe for winter. [buries the sweater in the sand]
SpongeBob: [walks outside and smells the air] I'd better call the doctor, 'cuz I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers. [sniffs them into his nose] Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Did you say, "Hello!" to the flowers yet?
Squidward: [sighs] ...Good morning, flowers. *hiss* [flowers hiss at him like snakes. Squidward screams and runs inside]
SpongeBob: Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers. [SpongeBob digs a hole and puts the flower in it] You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty. [turns around and grabs his container. When he turns back around, the flower is half eaten. He plants a new flower. When he turns around and grabs the container of water, he sees the flower is eaten again] Huh? [plants a new one] I'm not taking my eyes off you. [eyes stretch out staring at the flower]
Narrator: Three days later...
[SpongeBob is still staring, but his eyes have shriveled up. He uses the water to make his eyes normal]
Patrick: [running by] Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [turns around] Hi, Patrick! [when SpongeBob turns back around, the flower is eaten again] How does this keep happening?? [notices a seahorse eating the flower next to him] Hi. [horse neighs then gallops onto a rock] She's beautiful! [SpongeBob imagines riding the seahorse with a head full of wavy hair] What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish? [scene cuts to seahorse eating some flowers and SpongeBob looking at her from a distance writing in a book] Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic... perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty... or Debbie. [seahorse neighs] She must have spotted my floral bookmark! [using a flower bookmark in his book. Mystery gallops over slowly] She's coming this way. That's it, girl... don't be afraid... I'm just a talking sponge, is all... [Mystery sniffs the bookmark and then eats it. Scene cuts to SpongeBob riding with Mystery, blowing a bubble heart, posting for Mystery, making stamp books, and walking out of a store laughing with hats. Scene cuts to nighttime in SpongeBob's bed where SpongeBob is sleeping on the floor and Mystery is in SpongeBob's bed] Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever? [Mystery is asleep] I'll take that as a yes!
Squidward: [it's now morning as Squidward rides his bike. SpongeBob and Mystery gallop by him] What the...?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Still riding a machine to work I see.
Squidward: Don't say anything, Squidward, remember your karma. [Squidward's bike trips on something and he falls off a cliff, then explodes. He groans. SpongeBob arrives at the Krusty Krab and ties Mystery to a bike rack]
SpongeBob: Whoa, girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift. [walks in as Scooter and Wobbles walk by]
Scooter: Hey, look! Mr. Krabs put in a kiddie ride!
Wobbles: [Southern accent] Why doncha try it out? [Scooter gets out a quarter]
Scooter: I can't find the coin slot. Here it is! [Scooter finds the coin slot but Mystery kicks Scooter into the background and he explodes]
Wobbles: [runs off; screams; still in Southern drawl] HELP! Kiddie ride on the loose!
Mr. Krabs: [walks out] What's with all the ruckus!? [gasps] A monster scaring away me customers!
SpongeBob: That's not a monster, Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery.
Mr. Krabs: ...You're a mystery, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob laughs] Get rid of it.
SpongeBob: Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow!
Mr. Krabs: It's either you or Mystery.
SpongeBob: I knew I should've named her Debbie. [scene cuts to SpongeBob, sad, grilling up some patties]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!
SpongeBob: [in a sad voice] You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now, if we could only get rid of Squidward. [laughs then walks out]
SpongeBob: Good one, sir. [takes his pair of sad eye contacts off] Hah! It worked, girl. [opens the cabinet with Mystery inside it] We'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build. [scene cuts to Patrick sitting down with a board on his forehead, doing absolutely nothing] Only eight more hours. [closes cupboards]
Narrator: Twelve seconds later... [Mystery peeks out of the cupboard]
SpongeBob: No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job. [SpongeBob gives her a tray with a patty on it] Wait a second. I bet you're hungry. How ‘bout some lunch? [Mystery eats the patty and neighs] Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob closes the cabinet quickly as Mr. Krabs comes bursting in] What was that? Is that horse in here?!
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs. I was just practicing my imitation of Mystery... wheesnoff.
Mr. Krabs: Well, keep working on it! That was terrible! [walks out]
SpongeBob: That was close. [gets a tray with three patties] From now on, no more hijinks. Order up! [puts the tray on the window. Mystery eats it. Squidward walks up to the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob, where's my order?
SpongeBob: Did you look under the tray?
Squidward: No I didn't, sorry. [looks under the tray then sighs] SpongeBob, could you just get my order?
SpongeBob: They vanished! Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next?! I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE! [runs to the door]
Squidward: SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!
SpongeBob: Oh?
Squidward: [Mystery approaches a customer's Krabby Patty] In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, [SpongeBob notices Mystery] you cook the food, then the customer gets the food. [SpongeBob's eyes move to the side of his face. Squidward is still talking] We do that for forty years and then we die. [Mystery eats a Krabby Patty and she burps] Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say? 
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back. [grabs Mystery and shoves her under a cupboard]
Squidward: What's that?
SpongeBob: Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control! [closes the cupboard] Now then, you were saying?
Squidward: Just get my order. [walks out]
SpongeBob: You got it, Squidward? [chuckles] Ghosts. [Mystery eats SpongeBob's Krusty Krab work hat] Mystery, you ate my hat. [Mystery burps out a spatula] Mystery, you ate my spatula. You ate all the Krabby Patties! You ate the stove! You ate Old Man Jenkins!!!
Old Man Jenkins: [from inside Mystery's belly] I don't want to be a burden.
Squidward: [customers yelling...] Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen.
Thaddeus: Where's our food?
Fred: I'm so hungry!
Tina: This is my only lunch hour!
Tom: Where's Old Man Jenkins?!
Squidward: Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, what's goin' on in here?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask Cowbob Ranchpants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot.
Mr. Krabs: [runs into the kitchen] SpongeBob! What's the meaning of all these nicknames!?! [his eyes bug out] DAVID H. JONES! [SpongeBob is by Mystery's side, who has eaten too much]
SpongeBob: Mystery got a bellyache from eating Krabby Patties. So I made her a bicarbonate of soda. [Mystery spits out Old Man Jenkins]
Old Man Jenkins: *burp* What did I miss? [Mr. Krabs takes out his eyes, blows on them, rubs them, and puts them back on]
Mr. Krabs: So, my eyes are correct! You still have that horse even when I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs. Please don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend. [Mystery licks SpongeBob's cheek. Squidward cries because of a bowl of onions near him]
Squidward: Hey, who left this bowl of onions here!?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] You do?
Mr. Krabs: I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together.
SpongeBob: What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [sniffles] And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda! [sobbing] My best friend! [crying] [Squidward cries because of the onions again]
Squidward: What? Would you get out of here?
Mr. Krabs: The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard. [points to Mystery] Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse. [two customers spit out their patties]
SpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.
Nat Peterson: [crying because of the bowl of onions Squidward is holding under his nose] Hey!
SpongeBob: Okay, girl, you're free to go. [takes Mystery outside and takes Mystery's leash off] I can't keep you anymore. [cries] I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild. [Mystery gallops away] Well, what are you waiting for!? Can't you see I don't want you anymore! [now begins bawling harder by a huge shot, as Patrick walks up with the board on his head] JUST GET OUT OF HERE, YOU STUPID DUMB ANIMAL! [resumes wailing intensely, Patrick walks away as Mr. Krabs walks up to SpongeBob] Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again.
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.
Squidward: Hey, Mr. Krabs! Looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad! [vault of money opens to show dollar bills that have been eaten and a bunch of money is missing]
Mr. Krabs: Get that horse! [He and SpongeBob run after Mystery.] 
SpongeBob: Mystery!
Mr. Krabs: Come back!
SpongeBob: Mystery! Wheesnoff!
Both: Mystery, come back here!
[The scene cuts to Patrick, who is trying to enter a hat shop, but the board nailed to his head keeps bumping him repeatedly as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]

 
Narrator:  Oh, a dark and stormy night. It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed a health inspector. [laughs evilly. Stormy night becomes calm day] It was a bright and sunny morning. [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where a fish drives up and stops in front of the restaurant. The scene zooms into his badge that reads 'Health Inspector']
Mr. Krabs: [Taking a bath in money] Ah...That smells like... [gasps] ...the health inspector! [Mr. Krabs runs up to SpongeBob in a yellow towel] Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here! [both are peeking out the kitchen window at the health inspector, who is writing on a clipboard] If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry. [eyes widen] The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.
Mr. Krabs: You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son? [pushes SpongeBob out the door] Just go out there and give him what he needs; pour on the charm. Sweet talk him. [SpongeBob walks up to the health inspector, who is still writing on his clipboard at the table]
SpongeBob: What can I get for you... handsome?
Mr. Krabs: [facepalms] We're doomed.
Health Inspector Yellowtail: I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.
SpongeBob: [walking backwards back into the kitchen] Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up! [SpongeBob enters the kitchen, where Krabs waits] He wants one of everything.
Mr. Krabs: Then we'll give him a smorgasbord! [holds up a tray of a patty, a drink, some fries, and coral bits] The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run up to the health inspector]
SpongeBob: Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir! [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven. [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
SpongeBob: The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite. [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Fresh Sludge Pudding? [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
SpongeBob: More Diet Red Tide? [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Some Fried Flotsam? [stuffs it in the inspector's mouth]
Health Inspector: Please, gentlemen! [swallows all the food in his mouth] Leave me to finish my work in peace. [clicks his pen, which is actually a fork that comes out. Later, the health inspector has eaten everything on the table and belches]
SpongeBob: And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
Health Inspector: [writes on his clipboard] So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.
SpongeBob: [open kitchen door] He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!
Mr. Krabs: [picks up SpongeBob] Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear! [both dance off then leapfrog over each other across the screen, then do the can-can in dresses until a news report comes on TV]
Realistic Fish Head: We interrupt this can-can for a special news bulletin. Be on the lookout for a man, who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food. That's all for now. [Mr. Krabs gets angry]
Mr. Krabs: [Yells] FRRRRREEEEEEE FOOOOOOOOOD?!?!?!
SpongeBob: Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.
Mr. Krabs: You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!
SpongeBob: Duped!
Mr. Krabs: Bamboozled!
SpongeBob: We've been smeckledorfed!
Mr. Krabs: That's not even a word, and I agree with ya! [both look through the kitchen window at the health inspector, who is wiping his mouth off, finishing his drink, and cleaning his teeth with a toothpick] Look at him, I bet he never changes his underpants.
SpongeBob: I bet he bites whale bubbles.
Mr. Krabs: I bet his mom bought him that hat. [holds up a Krabby Patty] If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one. [flicks the top bun off and puts a some volcano sauce on the patty] You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!
SpongeBob: It doesn't seem right... [holds up a bottle of seahorse radish] ...but it feels so good! [dumps a spoonful on the patty] Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean. 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hold on, I've got a jar of toenail clippings in my office! [runs off as SpongeBob drops the patty in the toilet]
SpongeBob: Oops, I dropped it in the toilet! [Mr. Krabs runs in with a smelly sock]
Mr. Krabs: Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks! [scene cuts to showing a disgusting Krabby Patty with what appears to be a pimpled bun and green meat] Why, that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned! [both are wearing clothespins on their noses]
SpongeBob: I call it the 'Nasty Patty'. [both laugh]
Health Inspector: Hey, hurry up with that patty! [SpongeBob runs in with the patty]
SpongeBob: [speaking quickly] Here you are, sir, enjoy. [runs back into the kitchen]
Health Inspector: Ah, hello, delicious. Come to papa. [as he is about to eat it, a fly flies into his throat, choking him]
Mr. Krabs: [listening from the kitchen] Listen, he ate it! [both look out from the kitchen window] Oh, look at him choke! [both laugh] Look at him suffer! [both keep laughing.] Did you see that, boy? Oh man, that look on his face. [Health inspector slips on some packets of condiments and bangs his head on the table, knocking him out. The fly exits his mouth. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are still laughing. Another TV bulletin comes on]
Realistic Fish Head: We interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash! The fake inspector has been captured! Here is his picture. [picture is shown on the TV] If a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy, he's real.
SpongeBob: Phew! That's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] I don't think he'll be laughin', boy...
SpongeBob: Why, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Because that patty killed him! [both scream, check the inspector again, then shriek again]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do!?
Mr. Krabs: What's this "we" stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!
SpongeBob: But you told me to give it to him!
Mr. Krabs: Well, you could've talked me out of it!
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me. [Mr. Krabs grabs him]
Mr. Krabs: Get a hold of yourself, boy! We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it. We've got to take it out and bury it. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs on a muddy hill.] 
SpongeBob: [disgusted] Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpse-y! [gagging and shrieking while constantly spraying it with disinfectant] Eww... eww... [SpongeBob is dragging the body by a tissue]
Mr. Krabs: This should be far enough. Now, get diggin'! [hands SpongeBob a shovel]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. [while digging a big hole, his shovel hits something]
Mr. Krabs: What's the holdup down there?
SpongeBob: There's a big rock in the way!
Mr. Krabs: Well, toss it out and get back to diggin'!
SpongeBob: [salutes] Aye aye, sir! [grunting as he tosses the huge rock behind him]
Health Inspector: Oh... where am I? [grunts as the rock hits him in the head knocking him out again, groans]
Mr. Krabs: Somethin' ain't quite right.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Mr. Krabs? [health inspector's head is out of the ground]
Mr. Krabs: His head's stickin' out!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob covers his head with more sand] Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I thought he might need some air.
Mr. Krabs: They don't need air where he's goin'.
SpongeBob: Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uh...
SpongeBob: [bawling] What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that! Why... why... why?! [Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean no one can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me. And worst of all, it'll be the end of me!
Officer Malley: [shines a flashlight on them] Stop right where you are! I'm afraid we're going to have to arrest the two of you. [SpongeBob hangs on Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail! [Mr. Krabs covers his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: And what would be the charges?
Officer Malley: For not being at the Krusty Krab to whip us up a couple of dee-licious Krabby Patties! [both police officers laugh. Mr. Krabs laughs nervously]
Mr. Krabs: Laugh, boy. [SpongeBob laughs. It rains. The rain washes away the dirt burying the health inspector and he slides down the hill]
Officer Nancy: Put that muddy shovel in the trunk and we'll give you a ride back. [SpongeBob is still laughing until Mr. Krabs hits him. Mr. Krabs opens the trunk and SpongeBob puts the shovel in it]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, listen carefully: We're just getting a lift back to the Krusty Krab. I need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool, understand? [SpongeBob looks down and goes in shock]
SpongeBob: Can I lose my cool now?
Mr. Krabs: Why? [SpongeBob points to the health inspector, who has now slid down the hill. Both scream, Mr. Krabs grabs the body and gives it to SpongeBob] Put him in the trunk, boy! I'll keep them cops busy.
Officer Malley: What's the holdup back there? [Mr. Krabs starts talking to him as a distraction]
SpongeBob: Oh, Neptune! Get away! [throws the inspector in the trunk then sprays himself with disinfectant.] Ooh...ahh-ahh... [Slams the trunk on the health inspector, who was waking up] A-hem... Okay! All set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk. [laughs nervously]
Mr. Krabs: All set. [SpongeBob slides in almost motionlessly]
SpongeBob: Ahh... [starts to shake]
Officer Nancy: You okay there, little fella?
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, he gets carsick real easy.
Officer Malley: Well, buckle up and we'll drive real smooth-like. [drives off]
Mr. Krabs: Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab I want you to take that [winks] shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...er... I mean, stow it in the freezer. Un-der-stand?
SpongeBob: I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo... [is about to say "body"]
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob's lips] ...ttles of soda! Bottles of soda, same thing, put 'em in the freezer. [Nancy stares at them funny. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is bringing the body to the back]
SpongeBob: Oh, man, this is so gross! [tries to open the door, but there is a lock] The back door is locked! What am I gonna do?! [scene cuts to inside the Krusty Krab with Mallay and Nancy laughing. SpongeBob enters with a big hat where the health inspector is in it]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there, SpongeBob. Heh. I thought you were out back taking care of that [angrily] shovel! [twitches and winks his eyes]
SpongeBob: Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here...eh. [his hat sags over, and SpongeBob puts it back in position] So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go put my hat in the freezer now. [walks to the kitchen very carefully]
Mr. Krabs: Okey-dokey, SpongeBob.
Officer Malley: Is that kid okay?
Officer Nancy: He's actin' a little funny.
Mr. Krabs: Funny? Oh. Yeah. [laughs] He's a real cut-up, that one. He knows how to keep the crew in stitches. Good one, boy! Always on, that one. There's no "off" on his funny switch. [laughs, SpongeBob stumbles with the Health Inspector in his hat as Malley, Nancy, and Mr. Krabs look on] Oh, ah, oh stop it. Oh, you're, you're killin' me. [laughs, SpongeBob is trying to get through a door but his hat is too big. Mr. Krabs bangs the cash drawer open] Oh! Look, I almost forgot! It's Open Cash Register Night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register! [hands out the money. SpongeBob gets his hat inside the kitchen]
Officer Malley: [listens to his walkie-talkie] 86 those patties, Krabs. We just got a call about two ghouls burying a stiff over by Shallow Grave Road.
Officer Nancy: I want a soda. [Mr. Krabs gives her one]
Mr. Krabs: Here's your soda. Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now.
Officer Nancy: Hey, there's no ice.
Mr. Krabs: [nervous] Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want, you want ice? Is that what you want? [SpongeBob slides on screen]
SpongeBob: The dark deed you requested is done, sir.
Officer Nancy: [walks to the kitchen] I'll get it myself. Ice is in the freezer, ri...? [Mr. Krabs runs to block the freezer door]
Mr. Krabs: THERE IS NO ICE! THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ICE! ICE IS JUST A MYTH!!!
Officer Nancy: Step aside. You people act like you've committed a murder!
Mr. Krabs: Okay! I confess! [points to SpongeBob] SpongeBob killed him!
SpongeBob: What?! You can't pin this whole rap on me!
Mr. Krabs: He was insane, out of control. He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along.
SpongeBob: It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.
Mr. Krabs: Put him down now, he's a mad dog!
SpongeBob: He wears curlers to bed!
Mr. Krabs: Wait! It's not what you think!
Officer Nancy: What are you two talking about?
Mr. Krabs: We killed a health inspector! Buried him and then stuffed his body in the freezer!
Officer Nancy: You mean in here? [opens the freezer, but it's empty]
Mr. Krabs: It's empty?
Officer Nancy: Is this some kind of a joke?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah... a joke! [SpongeBob giggles]
Officer Nancy: Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out. [everyone laughs. Just then a fish walks up moaning]
SpongeBob: AHHHH!!!! IT'S A ZOMBIE!!!! [the inspector turns the lights on]
Health Inspector: You guys...
Officer Malley: [hits the inspector on the head with an anchor] TAKE THAT, ZOMBIE! [inspector now has a huge bump on his head]
Officer Nancy: I'll take it from here. [hits the inspector on the head with a barrel] DIE, ZOMBIE!
Officer Malley: Good police work, Officer Nancy. Hey, this guy's not a zombie. He's just an ordinary health inspector.
Health Inspector: Yes. And at the risk of being hit again, I'd like to present you with this. [gives Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob a note with the word "pass" on it checked]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!
Everyone: Hooray! [everyone walks out of the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! [the inspector tries to crawl out] Well, not really.
Health Inspector: Oh, boy, I'd like a Krabby Patty. [door slams in his face. Scene cuts to above water where it's stormy again]
Narrator: Well, that's the story. Yes, they are all idiots, aren't they?


[SpongeBob is grilling Krabby Patties in the Krusty Krab kitchen until one of them suddenly levitates up from the grill and turns into a jellyfish. It floats out the window as the rest of the patties turn into jellyfish and do the same. SpongeBob follows them and flies out the window and turns into a jellyfish. He buzzes around Jellyfish Fields when he hears Mr. Krabs voice.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? SpongeBob! [the grill is on fire] Wake up, boy! You're burning me money! [SpongeBob wakes up from his dream and screams. Then runs behind Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what do we do?
Mr. Krabs: Here, use this! [Hands SpongeBob a fire extinguisher. SpongeBob throws it at the grill and sets the fire larger than before. Mr. Krab looks at SpongeBob for his stupidity, as he realizes his error. SpongeBob then tries to blow on the fire to put it out until a fireman comes into the kitchen with a hose and sprays SpongeBob with the water. SpongeBob enlarges and falls backwards, which puts out the fire]
Mr. Krabs and Fireman: Hooray! [SpongeBob shrinks and burns into a black sponge while Mr. Krabs scrapes him off the grill and on to a spatula]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come into me office. [in Mr. Krabs office] What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: Well, I.
Mr. Krabs: This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something.
SpongeBob: Well, I've been thinking.
Mr. Krabs: We need to get you thinking about work. [stretches his eyes out]
SpongeBob: No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. [Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat. [shows kitchen] This is your wide open range. [shows grill] These are your amber waves. [shows greasy fryers] And this[picks up a spatula from the sink]oh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's gone] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [walks out the Krusty Krab] I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles! [throws his hat on the ground]
Mr. Krabs: [opens doors] SpongeBob, wait! [sees SpongeBob's hat on the ground and screams] Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back. [SpongeBob is now giving his stuff away to his friends]
SpongeBob: And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener. [gives it to him]
Squidward: And I thought this friendship would never pay off. [walks away]
Patrick: [teary-eyed] Are-are-are-are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?
SpongeBob: It's all yours. [Patrick holds up a bunch of phone books]
Patrick: A-a-and these old phone books?
SpongeBob: All yours, old friend. [walks off and comes back with a case] Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have. [opens up a rectangular box that has the words "Ol' Reliable" on the front. A glowing jellyfish net is inside. Patrick throws the phone books away and picks up Ol' Reliable]
Patrick: Ol' Reliable? [cries as Sandy walks up]
Sandy: Howdy, y'all. Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?
SpongeBob: No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.
Sandy: SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright. [SpongeBob pats Sandy's helmet]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy. [walks away] Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye. [walks behind a bush and takes his pants off] I won't be needing these. [drops pants and runs away] Buzz, buzz, buzz.
Squidward: He took off his pants.
Sandy: I'll give him a week. [walks away]
Squidward: I'll give him eleven minutes. [walks away, throwing off the can opener at Patrick]
Patrick: Patrick sad! [at Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: [touches Jellyfish Fields sign] I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home! [jellyfish knock SpongeBob down as they fly by] Brothers and sisters, wait for me! [jellyfish fly into a hive] Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Okay, I'm here! [jellyfish fly out of hive] Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go... [sticks his finger in his mouth and then in his head] ...that way. [points to where the jellyfish went] Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. [running after jellyfish all over the fields. Jellyfish devour a bunch of kelp. SpongeBob decides to try it but is disgusted and spits it out from his tongue] This is the life. [jellyfish are floating in the middle of the fields as SpongeBob walks into the middle of the group] Hey, everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz? [wants to shake a jellyfish's hand] Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are? [jellyfish stings him and his hand, causing it to start swelling] Uhh... nice to meet you. [hand gets huge and swollen. SpongeBob smells some aroma and goes to check and see that Patrick and Sandy are having a picnic with Krabby Patties]
Sandy: "Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!" [whispers into Patrick's ear] There he is, Patrick. Say your line!
Patrick: [reading off script] "Why, thank you, Sandy, I would love one. [take patty.]" [takes patty] "Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home. [take bite.]" [sniffles. tries to take a bite, but throws the patty and the script away and turns to SpongeBob] I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not coming home.
Patrick: I miss you! [cuts to Sandy waving hello, but in guilt  manner because of set-up] Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you! [Squidward is throwing himself a party at home]
SpongeBob: I'm happy here. This is my home now. [Sandy drags Patrick away]
Patrick: No! SpongeBob! [later, SpongeBob comes in wiggling his arms and legs like the jellyfish]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this. [jellyfish float away as the net is swung at SpongeBob, which knocks him down. Patrick, breathing heavily,  is ready to capture SpongeBob with Ol' Reliable] Patrick! What are you doing?
Patrick: If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy! [shows a jar with a label on the front that says SpongeBob - Friend] I even picked out this nice jar for you!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now! [Patrick swings the net at SpongeBob but SpongeBob runs away. Patrick goes after him. SpongeBob hides behind a snail's shell, but the snail slithers off. SpongeBob goes to hide behind a rock]
Patrick: I can see you there! [SpongeBob hides behind a bush] I still see you! [SpongeBob hides behind another rock] You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs under neath an “N” shaped rock and peeks around. Patrick is underneath the rock on the top] I got you now, SpongeBob! [falls on the ground and misses SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick! No! [Patrick runs after SpongeBob again as SpongeBob jumps into the jellyfish hive. Patrick tries to get the hive down with the net, but he can't reach it. He vainly tries to jump to reach the hive, to no avail.]
Patrick: Okay! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy! [snaps the net in half over his knee and walks away, sobbing]
SpongeBob: Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters. [a drop of jelly lands on SpongeBob nose. He samples it] Mmm, jelly. [eats a lot of jelly as the jellyfish come back toward the hive] Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning. [jellyfish buzz into the hive] Greetings, comrades! [the jellyfish repeatedly shock SpongeBob and he screams. SpongeBob climbs out of the hive and runs as the jellyfish keep shocking him. Later, SpongeBob is in a cave] Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz. [rips off a bushel of grass] Buzz. [pushes rock over as he uses it for his pillow] Buzz. [pushes the rock aside and gets cold. The blanket scrunches up, but SpongeBob pushes it back down. Blanket scrunches up again and SpongeBob gets cold] Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy! [takes off the blanket and reveals 9 poison sea urchins] Ah! Poison sea urchins! [screams and scratches the urchins off of him and runs out of the cave] Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches. [crawls on the ground to stop the itching. Later, SpongeBob is walking home] Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. [buzzes fourteen more times as he walks up to the Krusty Krab door and sees a plate full of Krabby Patties on a table] Krabby Patties. [walks past Sandy's treedome, then he sniffles] Sandy. [still buzzing, walks up to his pineapple] What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. [opens the door and turns the light on. Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Squidward, Patrick, and Gary are there to welcome him home]
All: Welcome home, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty. [hands him a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do. [eats it as Mr. Krabs places his Krusty Crew hat on his head]
Mr. Krabs: And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning.
SpongeBob: [salutes] Aye, aye, captain!
Squidward: SpongeBob, do us all a favor. [hands SpongeBob his pants]
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do. [puts on his pants] Ta-da. [hugs Squidward] Aww.
Squidward: Okay, that's enough. [everyone else hugs SpongeBob and Squidward]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Can we please stop this? [everyone stops hugging]
Patrick: Patrick itchy! [everyone but SpongeBob starts to scratch themselves and crawl on the floor]
SpongeBob: It is great to be home!


Squidward: Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created. [blows kiss] Congratulations, chef! [gets dressed, takes a shower, gargles, and brushes his teeth. He re-enters the scene in a tuxedo and sits down at the table. He hears laughter from outside. He goes to the window and notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with bubbles. SpongeBob whispers into a bubble and it floats over to Patrick and pops.]
SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick.
[Patrick giggles as he was about to blow a bubble. He eats the bubble and whispers into another bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob where it pops.]
Patrick Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward, now annoyed, notices a liquid coming from his soufflé, pours it into a bowl and starts rapidly stirring the liquid with a fork until it becomes bubbly. Meanwhile, outside, Spongebob whispers into another bubble]
SpongeBob: [whispering into bubble] Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
[The scene cuts to Squidward's back window as he finishes stirring the liquid, and blows a bubble with it through the fork. Squidward's bubble is approached by SpongeBob's bubble, grows a leg, and kicks SpongeBob's bubble, thus popping it. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops.]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.
[Patrick frowns and blows a bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [whispering into the bubble] Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. [the bubble floats over to Patrick and pops, followed by another bubble floating back over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly. [another bubble comes over and pops] Yellow is ugly! [two other bubbles, but smaller, float over and pops, both containing raspberry noises for SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [talks into the bubble, puzzled] Patrick, what are you talking about?
[The bubble floats over to Patrick. Another bubble of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you. [SpongeBob gasps] You give bottom dwellers a bad name.
[Squidward creates several other bubbles and they float over to SpongeBob]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!
[Squidward laughs. Another bubble floats over to Patrick]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!
Patrick: [stands up and yells at SpongeBob] Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
SpongeBob: [stands up and yells at Patrick] Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
Patrick: Right, you're a turkey!
SpongeBob: What's that? [Squidward arrives outside with a lawn chair and his soufflé]
Patrick: It's what you are!
[Squidward begins to laugh hysterically at SpongeBob and Patrick's arguing.]
SpongeBob: Well, you're a bigger one!
Patrick: Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You are!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! [he goes inside through the back door and turns around] Aww, tartar sauce! [shuts door]
[Patrick angrily opens his rock, which closes and comes up sounding like an accordion. ]
Squidward: [Laughs at Patrick. Puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth.] [Continues laughing. Moves his tentacles around in laughter, then lies back in laughter accidentally swallowing the fork and choking on it. Chokes on the fork repeatedly and his skin turns to a deep shade of blue as the letters "K" and "O" appear in his right eye and left eye respectively and flashes appear. Squidward passes out and drools]
Patrick: Wow, Squidward, you're choking! [runs over to Squidward] Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well. [he takes a deep breath and performs CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick catches it] I win!
Squidward: Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Patrick: I did?
Squidward: Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend! [shakes Patrick's hands]
Patrick: Friend? [holds Squidward] Friend...
Squidward: [uneasily] Yeah, Patrick, we're friends... [steps back] just friends. [they both notice SpongeBob is gazing from his window with a blank stare]
Patrick: So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? [walks with Squidward over to the Easter Island head]
Squidward: Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Patrick: Clarinet? I love music!
[inside the pineapple, SpongeBob watches the two go inside Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? [Gary is sleeping inside his shell] Gary? [knocks on his shell]
[cut to Squidward's]
Squidward: Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Patrick: [sitting on a bench while clapping] Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! [Squidward takes a deep breath and plays a note, and Patrick immediately falls asleep, to the annoyance of Squidward. Scene cuts to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! [he holds up three fingers] Uhh... [he draws faces on each finger with a broken smile] The gang's all here... [he looks at the faces on his fingers, and his eyes well with tears] Ohhh!
[Squidward is dragging Patrick, who is still asleep, outside. Suddenly, after a few feet, his back gives out]
Squidward: Ow! Oh! My back! I threw out my back!
SpongeBob: [sees Squidward in pain] Oh, boy, now's my chance! [jumps out of the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
SpongeBob: [running] Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
Squidward: No, no, no, get away from me!
SpongeBob: Hang on! I'll save you! [rips off his suit revealing a speedo underneath]
Squidward: [tries to get to his door] No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
SpongeBob: [jumps off a diving board] Hold on!
Squidward: No, no! Get away! [screams as SpongeBob dives into his back cracking it back into place] Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend! [SpongeBob smiles big]
SpongeBob: Friend...
Squidward: N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. [Squidward and SpongeBob walk into the Easter Island head] So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
Squidward: You play?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! [he takes one from the wall] Give me an A, buddy! [Squidward plays a note and SpongeBob sings] Squidward is my best friend in the world. [grates strings with bow] Squidward is my best friend in the sea...
[The bow flies into what looks like Squidward's head and he screams. Fortunately, it turns out it's just a painting; the real Squidward pulls the bow out and growls as he snaps it in half with his knee]
SpongeBob: [now playing with his fingers like a guitar] Squidward...
Patrick: [pops in through the window] Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob. [SpongeBob slams the window in Patrick's face] Oh!
SpongeBob: [strums harder before slamming the bass to the floor] And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer! [smashes the bass] Umm, I can fix this. [Squidward is steaming red in fury]
Squidward: Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! [he kicks SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
Squidward: Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. [opens up the curtain and screams after he sees Patrick in his tub]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. [shows him a brush and soap]
Squidward: Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on! [SpongeBob peeks in through the upstairs window]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? [notices Patrick in the bath-tub] Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... [shown bath toys] ...rubber bath toys!
Patrick: [simultaneously] Oh, yeah?! Well, he was my friend first!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously] You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of...
Squidward: [screams] This can't be happening to me! [He runs away. SpongeBob and Patrick stop their arguing as they notice Squidward's gone]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
SpongeBob: Buddy!
Patrick: Squidward, where are you?!
SpongeBob: Where'd ya go, friend?
Patrick: Where are ya, ol' buddy?
Squidward: [hiding in a trash can] Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and outta my hair!
SpongeBob: [reading a magazine as the doorbell rings a letter is pushed under the door. Then he smells it] Squidward. [opens it] A dinner party? I'd love to! [SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door and Squidward opens it] Did you miss me?
Squidward: Come on in! You look stunning. [shuts door]
SpongeBob: I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy... [gasps when he sees Patrick] Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac!
Patrick: Me neither! This was a setup!
Squidward: I thought you two were my best friends.
SpongeBob and Patrick: I am your best friend!
Squidward: [takes out a bottle of soda] Well, how about some soda, guys? [SpongeBob shows him his glass]
SpongeBob: Yes, please! [Squidward gives him some soda] Thanks, friend. [flicks Squidward's nose] [drinks]
Patrick: How about some for your best friend? [SpongeBob puts his glass in front of Patrick's, so he gets the soda instead of Patrick]
SpongeBob: Thanks, best friend! [drinks]
Patrick: Can I have some now, buddy?
SpongeBob: Wait, I need some more! [pours SpongeBob another glass]
Patrick: I still didn't get any! [SpongeBob gives Patrick his soda]
SpongeBob: There ya go. More please! [Squidward fills his glass as SpongeBob drinks it really fast]
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward! [shows Squidward his glass again, but it's still full] Squidward!
Squidward: Patrick! Your glass is full!
Patrick: Oh, yeah...
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both show Squidward their glasses] Squidward!
Squidward: Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more. [walks away] Why don't you just stay here and chat? [closes door. Then we see SpongeBob and Patrick. They are extremely fat and not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door with a grocery bag. Then an explosion and crashing sounds are heard] I should just walk away right now. [opens door to find his house destroyed] What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? [pieces around the door break]
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? [both hug]
Patrick: Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
Squidward: Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
Squidward: No! Out! [both walk out]
SpongeBob: Psst, I think he's jealous.
Patrick: How pathetic. [Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around as a bubble comes and pops on the door which causes the door to fall on his back]
Squidward: Ohhhhh, my back.


[SpongeBob Patrick are browsing through Fry Cook Museum making noises at every rare item they see]
SpongeBob: Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula! [Larry tries to pull the spatula out]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look what it says here. [reads plaque] Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease, but all have failed.
Larry: [Makes a straining noise after the golden spatula springs back.]
SpongeBob: Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...the golden spatula. Wow!
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula! [SpongeBob runs up to the spatula and holds it] Okay, I'm ready! [Patrick is about to take a picture]
Miss Shell: Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is? [Patrick gets confused and drools]
Patrick: Uh!
SpongeBob: Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way. [SpongeBob pulls the spatula out and gray clouds appear above him] Uh-oh.
Miss Shell: [deep voice] Holy smokes! [runs away]
Patrick: Rude. Hey, the light changed.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick...
Patrick: [lightning bolts strike] Hold on, almost there. [clouds open to a mysterious figure comes out that is known as]
King Neptune: Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.
King Neptune: A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge. [SpongeBob goes droopy each time he is insulted] Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny! [laughs] Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook. [searches for the real spatula taker] No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no... [soon comes up to a hot dog stand] Ah! 
SpongeBob: But, but...
King Neptune: A purveyor of foods. [chuckles] Yes, you must be my new fry cook.
Hot Dog Vendor: Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them.
King Neptune: Then who pulled out the spatula?
Hot Dog Vendor: [scoffs at Neptune] Uh, he did. [points to SpongeBob]
King Neptune: [everyone laughs] It is even funnier a second time! [destroys the hot dog stand with his fist] You there, crustacean!
Larry: Who, me?
King Neptune: You have the physique of Atlas!
Larry: [laughs] Thanks, I work out.
King Neptune: [laughs] Make poses with me!
Larry: Okay!
Larry and King Neptune: [show off their muscles] Body slam! [body slams each other]
King Neptune: You pulled the spatula from the grease!
Larry: Nope, that was SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob smiles]
King Neptune: This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook? [everyone runs except Patrick] Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know who can flip a burger to suit a royal palate! [Patrick points to SpongeBob] What? Am I expected to believe this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof? [Patrick shows the photo he took of SpongeBob holding the spatula] Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.
SpongeBob: Like?
King Neptune: The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.
SpongeBob: Actually, I've got two. [shows two left hands]
King Neptune: [snaps fingers] Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear. [SpongeBob shows his red underwear] No, blue. [SpongeBob shows his blue underwear] Uh, the royal fry cook's wallet contains... [SpongeBob takes out his wallet] His big toes are... [SpongeBob gets ready to show something about his foot] Uhh, he has six...
Patrick: [contemptuously mocks Neptune] He is the new royal fry cook and you...
King Neptune: [shouting] Silence! [Patrick gets zapped]
Patrick: Is it hot in here or what? [falls over]
SpongeBob: [gasp] Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!
King Neptune: [grabs SpongeBob] So, little one, you think you have what it takes to be my fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!
Patrick: [faint, down below] [mocks Neptune again] Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any... [Patrick gets zapped again] Ouch.
King Neptune: Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.
Patrick:  [mocks Neptune again] Only two? What are two challenges to someone like Sponge- [Patrick gets zapped again]
King Neptune: Three challenges!
Patrick: Three? [laughs contemptuously] [mocks Neptune with sarcasm] Three challenges is nothing. It might as well be 500 challenges! [Patrick gets zapped again]
King Neptune: Enough! [Patrick gets zapped into a dust pile]
Patrick: He'll settle for one.
King Neptune: There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!
SpongeBob: I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
King Neptune: Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him. [Patrick gets zapped to normal]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! [turns around as we see that his face is now on the bottom of his body above his legs] SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!
SpongeBob: How you feeling?
Patrick: Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?
King Neptune: And now, see the fate that may lie ahead. [summons the clouds] For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great. [opens the clouds] Behold! [shows Tom Kenny taking a shower and he screams; Neptune quickly closes the portal and chuckles sheepishly] Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold! [opens the clouds again and shows the city of Atlantis] My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!
Patrick: Hey, that sounds pretty good.
King Neptune: But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?
SpongeBob: I'm ready.
King Neptune: Very well then. To the Poseidome! [At the Poseidome]
Mr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off! [Everyone cheers] All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.[King Neptune and SpongeBob shake hands. SpongeBob's arm disintegrates]
SpongeBob: [regrows his hand] May the best man win.
Mr. Krabs: Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking! [talking to SpongeBob] Don't worry, lad, I have total confidence in you. [Mr. Krabs has a lot of money in his hands] Put it all on Neptune!
SpongeBob: I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.
Patrick: Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: "Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds." Well, just look at me now. [bell dings] Go get 'em, tiger! [King Neptune starts making his Krabby Patties and so does SpongeBob.]
[King Neptune makes his very quickly with help from sea creatures and his magic. SpongeBob takes his time going through each important step to make sure his patty comes out right. King Neptune summons large amounts of wheat from the ground and zaps them into buns.]
[King Neptune summons the vegetables, and summons the swordfish to slice them all. SpongeBob makes sure a tomato is perfectly aligned. He carefully slices the tomato with the golden spatula.]
[King Neptune zaps the patties, while SpongeBob rubs sticks to create a fire. King Neptune uses magic to flip hundreds of patties. SpongeBob patiently waits for the patty to cook above the campfire.]
[King Neptune uses magic to assemble the hundreds of burgers that appear like Krabby Patties. King Neptune laughs while the burgers rain down. SpongeBob puts ketchup on two pickles to apply faces on them. He applies a cheese "blanket," kisses a pickle.]
SpongeBob: [reading a bedtime story to the pickles] Once upon a time...
[King Neptune still laughs, while the burgers assemble in a square-based pyramid. SpongeBob puts the top bun on his one Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Perfect!
[In the end, the score is King Neptune: 1000 and SpongeBob: 1]
King Neptune: I win! [everyone cheers but SpongeBob] Loser! [Chuckles] Free patties for everyone! [everyone chews a bite out of the patties that King Neptune made and they spit it out immediately] Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious! [sniffs one] Ooh.
Audience: [Everyone complains different complaints that King Neptune needs to try one of his burgers] You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!
King Neptune: [throws his burger out] Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better? [King Neptune grabs a patty from SpongeBob] Give me that! [King Neptune eats it and begins to like it] Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time! [King Neptune spits it out and eats it again; the crowd groans in disgust.]
SpongeBob: So, uhh, what do you think?
King Neptune: Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win. [everyone cheers]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Yeah! [both dancing] We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis! [King Neptune laughs]
SpongeBob: What's so funny?
King Neptune: You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?
SpongeBob: You mean, Patrick can't come?
King Neptune: [laughs] No, of course not.
SpongeBob: And my friends?
King Neptune: Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.
Patrick: [crying and wiping his tears with a tissue] It was nice knowing you, buddy!
SpongeBob: [Mr Krabs cries] I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too.
Mr. Krabs: I lost me bet!
King Neptune: Come, SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart... [a two-seater bike appears] to Atlantis![rings bell]
SpongeBob: I... I... [cries] I don't wanna go!
King Neptune: It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it! [King Neptune zaps SpongeBob and he becomes a muscular god. But being the same size, he looks a little strange] Maybe we do have a problem.
SpongeBob: [in a booming voice] Wait, Neptune! I have another idea! [Patrick walks in the Krusty Krab still looking the same when King Neptune changed him back to normal but with his face on the bottom]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. What'll you have? [Patrick drools stupidly then SpongeBob hears King Neptune shout] Can you excuse me?
King Neptune: The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thine own wrath, stove! [uses his powers to zap the stove] Haha!
SpongeBob: What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?
King Neptune: [Sighs. Embarrassedly puts arms behind his back.] Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic. [SpongeBob smiles]


SpongeBob: Gotta hurry, Gary! [rushes to put on his pajamas on, while Gary slithers over to where he sleeps] The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho! [stops in the middle of the room] The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world: The Krusty Krab!  Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed. [he puts on his blinders and tries running, but trips on a treasure chest and falls down. He quickly gets into bed without the blinders.] Well, good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm just going to turn out the lights. [turns off his light switch] Clickety poo! And close my eyes and go to sleep. [Gary is already asleep; close-up of his face] Just close my eyes and go to sleep. [grunts trying to close his eyes but can't] ...just close my... [his eyes shoot open] Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out. [runs around the room and on the walls] Oh, I just got to get some sleep! There's only one thing for this. [bubble transition to SpongeBob holding a glass of milk] Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk. [drinks all the milk, then waits for a few seconds] Dah! Why isn't it working-- [falls over suddenly, finally asleep. The next morning, the clam outside crows like a rooster, which wakes SpongeBob up. He looks disgusting and disturbed due to the place in which he slept] Whoa, Gary, what happened? [remembers what time it is and crashes through his front door with all his clothes on except for his left shoe and sock, which the former is still in his home] Agh, I'm late for work! [checks his pocket watch] Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...? [sees the bridge ahead is out] Bridge out? [jumps over the gap and continues to run then gasps again when he sees Nancy, Abigail and Shelly playing hopscotch up ahead] Hopscotch! [skips across the hopscotch board and keeps running] Almost there. [runs into the Krusty Krab and lunges at the time clock with his time slip in hand. The clock turns to 9:01 just as he puts the card into the slot. A balloon deflating is heard.] No! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say? [he goes into the kitchen, and his thoughts can be heard as he grills patties] TardyPants! You, sir, are a TardyPants! Wait 'till Mr. Krabs finds out. You better think of something to save your job.
Squidward: One Krabby Patty and Krabby Fries for table number four.
SpongeBob: Order up! [runs to the table] Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat.
[a little girl knocks her drink off the table]
Squidward: Spill at table...
SpongeBob: [runs out of the kitchen with a mop] I'm on it! [starts to mop up the spill] Nothing a dedicated, on-time employee can't handle. [mops the girl's head] Kiddies get a free touch-up. [giggles as he goes back into the kitchen] All done!
Mr. Krabs: [opens the door] Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [jumps into the air and grabs Mr. Krabs' leg] No! Please don't throw me out in the street! I am so sorry for what I did.
Mr. Krabs: What'd you do?
SpongeBob: I was a minute late for work!
Mr. Krabs: A minute late?
SpongeBob: A whole 60 seconds.
Mr. Krabs: Well, uh, don't do it again.
SpongeBob: No! No! You have to punish me!
Mr. Krabs: Well, you can clean the salad bar.
SpongeBob: Aye aye sir. 
Mr. Krabs: And good night. 
SpongeBob: I love it here, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sheesh.
Squidward: If you love it so much, why don't you just live here? [chuckling]
[SpongeBob grins, getting an idea. Cut to SpongeBob straining to get his feet through a cardboard box he's going to sleep in. He gets his feet through the box and uses napkins as a blanket]
SpongeBob: Somethin's not right. What is it? Do I miss my old clock? [there is a shot of the digital wall clock which says 12:31] Maybe it's my old bed. [SpongeBob quickly wiggles his toes] Oh, that's it. [snaps fingers] I'll make the Krusty Krab just like home. What do you say Gary? [Gary is a toilet paper roll with cucumbers for eyes. Cut to next day where Mr Krabs enters the Krusty Krab and sees SpongeBob sleeping in his bed in the dining area]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? What in Neptune's Navy is going on here?
SpongeBob: SpongeBob reporting for duty, sir.
Mr. Krabs: How long you been here?
SpongeBob: All night, sir.
Mr. Krabs: All night?
SpongeBob: That's right, I'm going to live here from now on, so I'll never ever be tardy pants again.
Mr. Krabs: Hold on! This ain't no hotel, son.
SpongeBob: [gets out a stack of cash from his pocket] Here's my first month's rent.
Mr. Krabs: Rent? Okay. Well, let's get ready for the customers. Start scrubbing the grill...
SpongeBob: Already done, sir. [grill is spotless]
Mr. Krabs: Well, start cooking some Krabby Patties...
SpongeBob: Done. [a bunch of Krabby Patties are in the kitchen ready for serving. SpongeBob punches his time card at 8:59] All that, before we even open up our doors, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Okay. Then get cleaned up. You're a mess.
SpongeBob: Eww, I guess I could use some freshening up. [ketchup and mustard stains are all over his clothes. Cut to Squidward putting a bucket of dishes on the conveyor belt but the dishwasher stops]
Squidward: Jammed again. [reaches inside to fix it but pokes SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is wearing a shower cap and towel] Ooh. Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob? What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Oh, I live here now.
Squidward: In the dishwasher?
SpongeBob: No, at the Krusty Krab. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Squidward: SpongeBob living at the Krusty Krab? Wait a minute, if he's living here, that means he won't be living next to me. [is shown lying in a field of flowers, but it turns out to be on the Krusty Krab floor]
Mr. Krabs: Must be a full moon. [cut to closing time] Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Just saying goodnight to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs. Sweet dreams, SpongeBob. You look much more comfier in here than in your old home next to me!.
SpongeBob: Won't you miss me living next door, Squidward?
Squidward: [laughing] No. Coming Eugene. [cheers as he walks out the Krusty Krab] Good night's sleep, here I come. [cut to next day where Squidward is talking to Frankie] And when I went home at night, guess what?
Frankie: He wasn't there?
Squidward: Right! And when I woke up in the morning...
Frankie: Can I just get my change?
Squidward: [laughing] He still wasn't there.
Frankie: Come on, man, my change.
Squidward: [grabs something out of the register] Here you go.
Frankie: Yeah, thanks... [gasps] Oh, real funny, buddy. Two socks and a pair of tighty whities.
Squidward: Socks and-- [gasps. socks and underwear are in the register instead of money] What the...? SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register?
SpongeBob: Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection. [blocks of snowflakes are in the freezer] So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Oh, lighten up, Squidward. 'Tis harmless tomfoolery.
SpongeBob: Do you want to know where the mustard is? [Gary is covered in mustard]
Squidward: Ah! Eww. [cut to later] Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor.
SpongeBob: [sings] Laundry song, la-la-la! Sing about your laundry all day long. La-la-la-la laundry song.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces. [Harold sees underwear and stops chewing]
SpongeBob: Well, they don't see to mind. [Harold takes down a pair of underwear and uses it as a napkin]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! I have a disgusting clientele. Who spend their money freely.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Aye aye, captain.
Mr. Krabs: Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangement—meaning yours—to interfere with said money spending. [tries opening his office door but can't] What the barnacles? [opens the door slightly to see all of SpongeBob's stuff in his office] SpongeBob! Why is your bed in me office?
SpongeBob: It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen. [squeezes inside the office] So I moved in here.
Mr. Krabs: You can't stay in here. These are my private quarters, boy. The only play I can escape for solitude during the day.
SpongeBob: But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please!
Mr. Krabs: Oh... Okay, but I'll have to raise your rent.
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr... [doorbell rings. SpongeBob gasps] My parents!
Mr. Krabs: Your parents?
SpongeBob: [opens up front doors] Mom! Dad! Come on in. [enters Mr. Krabs' office] And this is the guest room. Mom, Dad, Mr. Krabs.
Margaret SquarePants: Oh, hello. [Mr. Krabs' eye twitches. In the dining area, Harold and Frankie are slipping on snail trail that Gary is leaving on the floor]
SpongeBob: Well, I'll let you two get settled.
Jimmy: Is this your snail?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Gary! Bad boy! No!
Jimmy: Put that thing on a leash.
Mr. Krabs: [holding golden clam-shaped soap containers in his hand] Squidward, who put these fancy-smelling soaps in the restroom?
Squidward: The same person who knitted these napkin holders and embroidered the menu. [shows both items]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Argh. [walks to his office] That boy's taking the manliness out of me restaurant. Oh, he didn't. Floral print curtains in me office? That's it. That's the last straw! I'm not putting up with this any longer. [rips curtains down to reveal Margaret SquarePants taking a shower]
Margaret SquarePants: Oh!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, oh, I...I'm sorry. I didn't know... [walks backwards into Harold SquarePants]
Harold SquarePants: [angered] What's going on in here?!
Mr. Krabs: No, I... [thrown out of his office. Hears buzzing in the kitchen] What the...?
Patrick: [walks out of the kitchen] Thanks, SpongeBob. [points to his lower back, background woman screaming plays] If I could reach it, I'd do it myself. [all the customers run out in disgust]
Mr. Krabs: Me customers! [cries] Gone! Gone! Gone! All they wanted... was to give me...their money! [strained cries.. then gets angry ] SpongeBob! Pack your bags, boy. You're moving out. [SpongeBob is shaving in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Squidward is about to relax in his lawn chair when a moving truck drives up]
Squidward: What the...? SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums! [plays the drums frantically.]
Squidward: Noooo! [cries on the ground. Cut to next day where Mr. Krabs opens up the Krusty Krab, but this time, all of Squidward's stuff is inside.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward!


[The scene starts out at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is looking at Plankton through a telescope.]
Plankton: [waving a truce flag] I surrender!
Mr. Krabs: Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time. [walks up to Plankton] Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work.
Plankton: There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?
Mr. Krabs: What is this? [takes the flag and looks at it for any secret material] Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me.
Plankton: Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!
Mr. Krabs: But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?
Plankton: Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it. [sighs] Let me show you something. [scene cuts to them walking into the Chum Bucket, which is full of spider webs] Look at this place!
Mr. Krabs: [runs into a spider web and screams] Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?
Plankton: What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?
Mr. Krabs: Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer.
Plankton: Well, there he is. [points to skeleton rat on the table] That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into... [pulls out a box of knickknacks] this!
Mr. Krabs: You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?
Plankton: No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?
Plankton: I'm serious, Krabs. Soon, the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum.
Mr. Krabs: All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down.
Plankton: Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career. [hums as Mr. Krabs walks away]
SpongeBob: What's going on Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.
SpongeBob: Whatever you say, cap'n. [peels eyes]
Mr. Krabs: Now that's an employee who follows orders. [loud jack hammering is heard] What in blazes is that noise? [Plankton reveals the new name of his business: "Chumporium"]
Plankton: Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items.
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game.
SpongeBob: [holding a snow globe] Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium.
Mr. Krabs: [takes the snow globe] Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere. [tries to open it]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Mr. Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, we'll see about that. [walks to a door] I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past. [throws snow globe into a room full of Plankton's past schemes, then locks the door] Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.
SpongeBob: That's some good news, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Right away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Let's party! [music plays and SpongeBob is seen DJ-ing] Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Squidward: This is idiotic.
Mr. Krabs: Dance or you're fired.
Squidward: You got it, Mr. Krabs. [dances]
Mr. Krabs: [opens front door] How do you like them apples, you little... [record scratching]
Plankton: [carrying a toy seal behind him] Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute. [sneaks over to the Chumporium] What the...? [sees a bunch of novelty items inside through the window] Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps? [gasps] Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war. [scene cuts to Mr Krabs walking into the Chumporium. Plankton is dusting off his knickknacks]
Plankton: [Humming] Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me.
Plankton: Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed. [laughs then sighs] Those were the days, huh Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Grr...
Plankton: But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.
Mr. Krabs: Bubkes.
Plankton: Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.
Mr. Krabs: Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula. [takes out the formula] You know you want it.
Plankton: Thanks, but no.
Mr. Krabs: A-ha, I knew it. [chuckles] It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?
Plankton: Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine.
Mr. Krabs: Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front... [throws one of the shelves down. Plankton gasps] ...a sham, a snow job... [throwing snow globes onto the ground and breaking them] ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive! [shatters a row of lava lamps with a big stick] SEE?! Who's the one with the problem?!
Plankton: Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.
Mr. Krabs: Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow. [chuckles]
Plankton: [very angry, screaming] Get out!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move. [drops the formula] Oops.
Plankton: What's this? [groans] Hey, Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: I knew you'd come back.
Plankton: You forgot something. [throws the formula back at Mr. Krabs] Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton! [cries loudly, he runs across the road and falls down crying some more. Scene cuts to night. Phone rings in the Chumporium as Plankton is taking a shower]
Plankton: Coming, coming. [answers] Yo.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, Plankton?
Plankton: Eugene?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, hey.
Plankton: Hey.
Mr. Krabs: Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?
Plankton: Yes. I'm still here.
Mr. Krabs: Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?
Plankton: Sure. [scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab. Mr Krabs and Plankton are sitting at a table with sodas]
Mr. Krabs: Glad you could make it, buddy.
Plankton: So, what's this about, Krabs? [sips his soda]
Mr. Krabs: I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.
Plankton: Yes. Yes, I would like that very much. [scene cuts to Mr Krabs and Plankton walking along the pier then playing pool] I guess I won. [both laugh before Plankton gets hit by a ball. Scene cuts to both in a hot air balloon, on a slide, eating cotton candy, then at a trust booth]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.
Plankton: Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you. [chuckles. Mr. Krabs falls back and Plankton strains to keep him up. Scene cuts to both sitting on the edge of the pier]
Mr. Krabs: That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%.
Plankton: Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me.
Mr. Krabs: And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something.
Plankton: Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts.
Mr. Krabs: No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.
Plankton: I can't believe you would even think...
Mr. Krabs: Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.
Plankton: You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.
Mr. Krabs: Come on, take it.
Plankton: You sure? [Mr. Krabs nods] Life is good, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Sure is, buddy. Sure is. [screen fades to black. Plankton appears]
Plankton: Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo! [laughs. Runs into his Chumporium] I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician. [laughs. Opens up the formula to read "GOTCHA! Love, Krabs". Lights turn on]
Mr. Krabs: I'd never give you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade. [laughs and walks out. Plankton screams with frustrated anger.]


SpongeBob: [turns off the alarm] Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary. [Gary pushes a button that sends SpongeBob jumping out of his bed, into the air. SpongeBob bounces off a chair, while sipping his cup of tea] Ahh... [toast pop out into the air, where SpongeBob eats them. Gary spits SpongeBob's pants into the air where SpongeBob lands on a target that Gary has painted] Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though. [Gary gives him an angry look. SpongeBob heads to the door] See you later. [opens the door where Patrick is standing there with a net in his hand]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today.
Patrick: Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?
SpongeBob: I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?
Patrick: [starting to sob] Wait for you to get back.
SpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?
Patrick: Hey, that's a great idea!
SpongeBob: You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it! [Patrick imagines a Kindergarten Class photo of him and SpongeBob smiling goofy with each other]
Patrick: Wow. [scene cuts to them at school]
SpongeBob: Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime. [shows Patrick Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
Patrick: [laughs] And no line.
SpongeBob: Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning. [runs up to the water fountain] And this is the Fountain Of Learning. [runs to the lockers] And these are the Lockers Of Learning.
Patrick: [runs up to some stairs] And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?
SpongeBob: No, they're just the stairs. [walks over to another set of stairs] These are the Stairs Of Learning.
Patrick: Where is everyone?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'til 9.
Patrick: [He suddenly, hilariously wears a watch, and looks at it] 6:20? But I thought you said you were late.
SpongeBob: Late for being early!
Patrick: Hey... [looks at his watch] When did I start wearing a watch?
SpongeBob: [both walk into the classroom] And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.
Patrick: Ohh.
SpongeBob: [walks up to the chalkboard] And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.
Patrick: Ohhh.
SpongeBob: [walks up to the Good Noodle Board] And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.[looks at Patrick]
Patrick: Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!
SpongeBob: [points to each star] Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too. [adds Patrick's name] There you are.
Patrick: But look at all the stars you have. I'll never be that good.
SpongeBob: Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem! [high pitched] 74.
Patrick: Who said that? [runs over to an egg in a box] Was it him?
SpongeBob: I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.
Patrick: What does he teach us?
SpongeBob: The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat. [points the light bulb] This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes... Roger would die.
Patrick: [turns light on and off] LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH! LIFE! DEATH!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: [turns light on] Sorry... [SpongeBob moves his desk to the front of the teacher's desk]
SpongeBob: The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?
Patrick: [jumps into the chair] I'm learning!
SpongeBob: This is gonna be great! [both giggle. Scene cuts to class]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?
Patrick: [confused] Who's the fat kid talking to?
SpongeBob: You, Patrick, she's the teacher.
Patrick: Oh.
Mrs. Puff: Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous. [Patrick gets up and looks at class]
Patrick: Uhh...guhhhh...
Mrs. Puff: We just want to know your name. [Patrick gets more nervous]
Patrick: Gyuhhh...uhhh...guhhhh...24. [class laughs hysterically]
Class: HAHAHAHAHAHA!
Mrs. Puff: [sarcastically] Oh, great, another genius...
Patrick: [sits back down] Why are they laughing?
SpongeBob: I guess it's just in the timing.
Patrick: Oh. [Patrick laughs after a brief pause]
Mrs. Puff: [writes on the chalkboard] Today's first lesson will be on turning.
Patrick: 24. [both start to giggle, and Mrs. Puff pauses and continues writing]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I thought of something funnier than 24.
Patrick: Let me hear it.
SpongeBob: [stifled laugh] ...25. [both try and fail to hold in their laughter. Patrick goes red in the face while SpongeBob bangs his fist on his desk]
Mrs. Puff: [overhears] That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Now then, "Turning"; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least... [Patrick places a paper on SpongeBob's desk]
SpongeBob: [looks at the drawing Patrick gave him of Mrs. Puff and gasps] Big Fat Meanie!?! Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!
Mrs. Puff: What about the teacher? [SpongeBob screams then shivers and bites his lip in fear as Mrs. Puff sees Patrick's drawing of her. She now appears the same shape as Patrick's drawing to demonstrate the "ugly" drawing.] AS IF I REALLY LOOK LIKE THIS! [puts it a drawer with a bunch of other bad drawings of her. Mrs. Puff returns back to her original shape and blames SpongeBob.] SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions. [Takes out a scraper. Scraper shines.]
SpongeBob: No...
Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle. [walks over to the Good Noodle Board]
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!!
Mrs. Puff: [about to remove the star] You'll get this star back when you earn it.
SpongeBob: [wailing] NOOOO! [As Mrs. Puff positions the scraper under the star and begins to peel it off, SpongeBob goes berserk, bouncing up and down in his seat and banging his head on his desk, constantly panting as he bangs his head. SpongeBob's head spins around on his body as Mrs. Puff slowly removes the star.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  [When the glue holding the star to the board stretches to the point of it snapping off the board, SpongeBob's eyes roll to the back of his head and he faints, sliding out of his seat onto the floor.]
Patrick: [raises his hand] Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room!
SpongeBob: What, me? But why?
Mrs. Puff: Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!
SpongeBob: [Mad] Thanks a lot, Patrick.
Patrick: Sure thing, buddy. [SpongeBob walks to the back. His classmates are staring at him]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here. [Mrs. Puff's voice is receding as SpongeBob tries to listen from the back] It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway? [reads the writing on the desk] 'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?
Patrick: Psst, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [to himself] Just ignore him, SpongeBob.
Patrick: SpongeBob, over here.
SpongeBob: Whatever you do, don't look at him.
Patrick: Psst, SpongeBob. [grunts as he throws a piece of wadded-up paper at SpongeBob] Psst, SpongeBob. [throws a book at SpongeBob] SpongeBo-ob! [spits a bunch of spitballs on SpongeBob's face] SpongeBob? Psst, over heeeere... I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.
SpongeBob: [whispers loudly] What?!?!
Patrick: [meekly] Hi.
SpongeBob: [yells, removing all the spitballs] HIIIIIIIIIIIIII?!?!?! [he growls, then stops when he sees Mrs. Puff angry, covered in spitballs]
Mrs. Puff: Perhaps this would be a good time for recess. [scene cuts to SpongeBob at his locker. Patrick walks up to him]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff.
SpongeBob: [angrily slams his locker] There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!
Patrick: [becomes angry] Who cares about a stupid star?
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, CONSIDERING YOU ARE ONE!
Patrick: I'll deal with you after class!
SpongeBob: It is after class! [a group of students crowd around SpongeBob and Patrick chanting 'fight']
Patrick: I don't see anyone fighting, do you?
SpongeBob: They're talking about us! We're fighting!
Patrick: Well, don't mind if I do! [both start to punch. The group of students start to quiet down as they notice SpongeBob and Patrick are punching, but missing at the same time]
Student: This is embarrassing. [everyone leaves as Mrs. Puff walks up]
Mrs. Puff: [lifts SpongeBob and Patrick] What's going on here?! [looks at Patrick] Well?
Patrick: SpongeBob and I were fighting.
Mrs. Puff: [gasps] Fighting? [puts them down] Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend [lights dim on Mrs. Puff and scary music plays] to detention!
SpongeBob: Detention!?
Mrs. Puff: May Neptune have mercy on your soul. [Mrs. Puff turns off the flashlight she was holding. Scene cuts to classroom where SpongeBob is sitting at the front and Patrick is sitting at the back]
SpongeBob: [sulking] In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg. [angrily] It's all Stupid Patrick's fault. [turns to look at Patrick] I hate you, Patrick.
Patrick: I hate you more.
SpongeBob: I'd hate you no matter what.
Patrick: Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.
SpongeBob: [stares at Patrick for a few seconds, then narrows his eyes] I'd hate you even if that made sense.
Patrick: I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.
SpongeBob: I'd hate you, even if, uhh... [tries to think of something else to say] Um, I'd hate you... [points to Roger's tank] even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out. [The camera quickly pans over to where SpongeBob is pointing. Suddenly, the light bulb flickers, and then burns out completely, with smoke rising out of the light bulb] Huh?
[SpongeBob bites his lip and starts shivering. He glances over at Patrick. Patrick is sitting at his desk about to cry.]
Patrick: Ohh... [He starts to turn to look at SpongeBob, but when he sees him, he quickly looks away from him, crossing his arms.] Hmph.
[SpongeBob watches Patrick, surprised, then does the same. But then he sees Roger's egg shivering in his tank and really starts to panic. We then see that it's snowing in Roger's tank. Snow is piled up around Roger, who is shivering under a pile of snow. Sleigh bells jingle in the background.]
Patrick: [teary-eyed again] Ohhhhh...! [cut back to Roger, who is frozen inside a giant ice cube, with wind blowing]
[SpongeBob and Patrick begin to quietly sob. The camera closes-up on SpongeBob, then Patrick. Finally, unable to take it anymore, SpongeBob turns around in his desk.]
SpongeBob: Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!
Patrick: [talking fast] I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs--
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, your apology is so long!
Patrick: Me too! Let's save Roger! [they run to Roger]
SpongeBob: [takes Roger] I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet!
Patrick: [opens the door to the supply closet] Ahh! LIGHT BULB! [there is a pile of light bulbs, but Patrick is looking at the one that is already plugged in at the top] But why does it have to be so far away? [begins to climb the pile of bulbs. SpongeBob tries warming up the egg by sitting on it, huffing and puffing on it, etc. while Patrick is still climbing the pile of light bulbs, wearing fancy clothing. Patrick finally reaches the top, blows a horn, removes his clothes, then runs down the pile with the light bulb] I'm coming, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth. [runs into Patrick and both of their items are in the air] The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!
Patrick: Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm! [both jump for the item that is closest to them and crash into the floor with an item in their hands. They put the light bulb and egg back where they were]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!
Mrs. Puff: [off-screen] Good job boys! [Mrs. Puff turns on a light from behind the chalkboard] I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School.
Patrick: Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class. See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big, Fat Meanie. [leaves the classroom]
Roger: [egg hatches] Hey! What'd I miss?


[The episode launches with SpongeBob reading at night in his pineapple home]
SpongeBob: [Reading] "And slowly... Ever so slowly... The ancient crypt door creeps open... And from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!" [Closes the book and shudders] That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary? [Gary is literally stiff with fear. He quakes and falls on his side. SpongeBob picks him up and puts him into bed next to him] Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary? [Silence] Well, I guess I should turn off the light now. [He does so] Sure is dark. [He then sees a green monster with its brain protruding from his head in the dark. He gasps, screams and turns the light back on to reveal his inflatable raft chair. Roaring] Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark. [He turns off the light and hears a knocking on his window. He turns to it and sees that there's a shriveled green claw knocking] Whoa! Another monster! [He turns on his light to reveal it's a green coral branch floating in the current] Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of! [He hears a creaking sound as if his door had opened] What was that? [Turns the light on and off multiple times, seeing monsters over and over. The next day, at the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward, have you seen SpongeBob? [At that moment, a very drowsy and tired SpongeBob walks in. We see a close-up of his 5 o'clock shadow, bloodshot eyes, and droopy nose]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. You don't look so good, laddie.
SpongeBob: Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Krabs. I just had a rough night. But it's nice and bright today! [He walks into the kitchen and we hear a big clatter from outside. Mr. Krabs bursts through the kitchen door]
Mr. Krabs: Meandering mermaids! What's all this racket, boy? [We see SpongeBob running around in circles with a pot on his head]
SpongeBob: [screams] The dark! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! [Mr. Krabs pulls it off his head]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Get a hold of yourself, boy. [SpongeBob is silent, but then blinks and screams]
SpongeBob: [screams and blinks repeatedly]
Mr. Krabs: What is it now, boy?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob blinks and screams] [Blinks and screams again] Whenever I blink, I see nothing but the darkness!
Mr. Krabs: Then don't blink.
SpongeBob: Great idea, Mr. Krabs. [Puts two french fries between his eyelids to prop them open]
SpongeBob: Yes, it's working... [His eyes are unable to function properly, and shut. The french fries snap and go flying; SpongeBob screams]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, thats enough! We've got fifty orders to fill! Now go in the cooler and get some fresh patties.
SpongeBob: You want me to go in there? [It is dark, and frost drifts out. We pan in on the darkness, and Derek Iversen's head appears laughing while making an irritated expression. It seems to swirl around the doorframe. SpongeBob screams and clings to the kitchen ceiling]
SpongeBob: Save me, the darkness!
[Mr. Krabs pries him off and pulls him down]
Mr. Krabs: Now, look here. Your work is starting to affect me profits. You need to get some shut-eye. Why don't you get yourself a night light?
SpongeBob: Night light?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, boy! It'll keep your room lit, so you won't be scared stiff!
SpongeBob: Great idea, Mr. Krabs. [That night, SpongeBob browses Barg’N’Mart wearing his green pajamas and nightcap] Night light, night light... Oh! [Sees a whole wall of them in different shapes and colors at the end of an aisle. He sees one that he likes in particular] Oh, it's beautiful! [He walks up to Gale Rechid drinking coffee at the register] Excuse me! Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the creepy creatures of the dark away?
Gale: If I answer "Yes", will you leave the store sooner? [Cut back to SpongeBob's pineapple the same night. He plugs the night light into the outlet, and it illuminates the room slightly with a blue color]
SpongeBob: Now that I can see... [Jumps up and floats into bed] Woo-hoo! I can sleep! [He yawns and pulls over the covers. But suddenly, he screams again] I wonder what's in my dark, scary-looking bathroom! [Screams again and returns to Barg’N’Mart then screams some more] Night light! Night light! [We see a shot of the Gale, sipping coffee, as SpongeBob panics and darts to the back of the store. Then, he approaches the camera, night light in hand. He leaves a dollar on the counter] Oh, thank you, thank you! [At home, he plugs it in and sighs with relief. Then, he screams, seeing that his closet is dark. He runs back to Barg’N’Mart and we see the same shot as earlier. He runs home and puts a night light in his closet, but notices that his hallway is dark. He runs to and from and to and from Barg’N’Mart. Then, back at home, we see him plugging in the rest of the night lights. Screaming] There, there, there, and there. [Plugs one into an outlet in his medicine cabinet, under his fridge, in his toilet, and the back of Gary's shell] I've been needing to change your tail light anyways, Gary. [He giggles. We see his whole living room is covered with a wall of millions of night lights] Now there's not one square inch of dark!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What was that, Gary?
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob gasps and rolls his eyes in, like he did in "Plankton", to see his brain in the back of his head]
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary! I've got darkness inside of me! [He turns on two flashlights and sticks them in his eye sockets. Outside his pineapple, the whole thing seems to be glowing orange from all the lights. It wakes Patrick up, and he walks outside]
Patrick: SpongeBob's having a party without me? [Walks over to SpongeBob's pineapple and knocks on the door] Hmph! Throw a party without your best friend? Oh, we'll just see about that. [SpongeBob opens the door and yanks Patrick inside]
SpongeBob: That was close, Patrick! You're safe under these night lights. But you can't go out in the dark, buddy! You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows!
Patrick: Oh! [Patrick starts shuddering, and runs out. SpongeBob follows, but gets bounced back be the door, into his chair beside Gary]
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick! [He hear a thundering sound and the ground shakes] What is that, Gary? [We see Patrick's rock smash through the wall and he slides it into SpongeBob's pineapple. Gary climbs on the armrest of SpongeBobs inflatable chair that he's in as its pushed into the other wall, where it pops. SpongeBob runs over to Patrick, who is panting and out of breath] Patrick, what are you doing!?
Patrick: Oh! I had to move my rock out of the dark and into the light.
SpongeBob: You know what that means? [He somersaults into the air and dies a flip. He lands on a neon light that says "Sleepover". Confetti sprinkles from the roof, and SpongeBob's tongue rolls out like a noisemaker] Sleepover! [He jumps down, two sleeping bags in his hands. He bows and presents one to Patrick] Your sleeping bag, sir.
Patrick: Thank you, my good man. [Both unroll theirs in a regal manner, hop inside each of theirs, and dance to a sea shanty. When they're done, they laugh]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick! I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t...
Both: The dark! [They both scream and jump out of their sleeping bags. They stand on the other side of Patrick's rock, away from the hole, and under the lights. Meanwhile, at Squidward's house, the light reflects off of his picture frame, to his vanity-dresser mirror, to his hand-held mirror, and to his sky roof window, where it shines down on his eyes, covered by a sleeping mask. The light laser burns his eyes to a crisp]
Squidward: [screams] Burning! [He cools his eyes with his glass of water on his nightstand. Through his singed, blackened, and charred eyes, he looks out the window to see SpongeBob and Patrick. Back at the pineapple, SpongeBob and Patrick cling to each other, quivering and shivering]
SpongeBob: The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us... [Squidward darts in front of them]
Squidward: What are you two whimpering about? [Both scream, and Patrick jumps into SpongeBob's mouth for protection]
Squidward: It's me, Squidward, you idiots! [Patrick pops out of SpongeBob's mouth]
Patrick: Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: Listen, you guys. I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time. But could you turn off all these lights?
SpongeBob: But, Squidward! Without our night lights, the creepy creatures of the dar-
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, there are no creepy creatures of the dark. It's all in your imagination. [Squidward starts nearing the exit, when Patrick drags behind him, tugging on the back of his nightgown]
Patrick: No, Squidward! Don't go out in the dark! [The back of Squidward's nightgown tears off] Oh, why won't he listen? [Patrick cries over SpongeBob's shoulder, and SpongeBob consoles him by giving him a pat on the back]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what if Squidward's right? What if all this is all in our imagination?
Patrick: Well, in that case, we'll need even more lights!
SpongeBob: You said it, Pat! [They run outside and return with a huge neon sign]
Patrick: Quick, SpongeBob! Turn it on! [He does so. The light says "Pinky's Dance Studio" and has mechanical swaying legs with fishnet tights on] More lights! [They run out and return with a spotlight. Patrick shines it on his face, which causes it to become all crusty and starts to crumble] Now, SpongeBob! More lights! [They run to a lighthouse and Patrick tips it over onto SpongeBob. Then, they carry it into SpongeBob's house through the hole Patrick made, and slide it onto Patrick's rock. The whole house is elevated because of this, until it snaps in half and the bottom half lands like normal. Cut to Shady Shoals Rest Home, where superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy sit on a couch watching TV. Barnacle Boy has dozed off]
Fish #1: [On TV] The battery-operated spoon has saved me so much time.
Mermaid Man: [Sighs] This is what passes for info-tainment these days? [Sees the "M" light in the air and mistakes it for the "MermaSignal".] Sweet mother of Neptune's mother! Look, Barnacle Boy! A call to action! To the Invisible Boat Mobile! [Cut to SpongeBob's pineapple home]
Patrick: More lights, SpongeBob! More lights! [They crash into Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man!?
Patrick: Barnacle Boy!
SpongeBob: Aww... Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us?
Mermaid Man: We don't have time for your childish games! We're responding to the distress signal that you sent!
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. There appears to be a misunderstanding. You see, Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the monsters in the dark! We weren't trying to summon you.
Mermaid Man: Oh, fiddlesticks, SpongeBob. Do you know how hard it is in our... advanced age... to move? Don't shine a giant light in the sky unless there's a real emergency. [Cut to a super villain dressed like a white moth. He cackles, and flutters towards SpongeBob's house] And another thing: What the-!? [He sees the moth villain] Dear Neptune! It's the most dangerous and foreboding of all our arch nemeses—My mortal enemy whom I have searched 57 years for! At last, I have you! Come get some, fiend! [The Moth kicks Mermaid Man in the nose, and it throbs and swells] Come back here, rival! [He becomes weary and heroically naps on Patrick's rock]
SpongeBob: Oh, my! Mermaid Man needs assistance! There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here! [The Moth flies towards the lighthouse, and SpongeBob runs up it, too. The Moth cackles]
The Moth: Savory light, come to me!
SpongeBob: Say, let me help you! [He grabs the Moth and locks him inside of the lighthouse window with the light beacon. The Moth flutters around frantically and screams] Is that enough light for you? [SpongeBob laughs, then jumps down to the heroes and Patrick] Well, he's all taken care of.
Mermaid Man: Who?
SpongeBob: The Moth, silly! Your archenemy. You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon! [At that moment, the Moth pushes up on the lighthouse and flies away, taking SpongeBob's house with him]
The Moth: See you in another 57 years! [He laughs wickedly as he flutters away]
Mermaid Man: No!
Barnacle Boy: I think it's time to go home.
Mermaid Man: Why are we here again?
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Bye, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
Mermaid Man: Who are those two hideous creatures of the dark?
Barnacle Boy: [Yawning] I'll tell you about it in the morning. Now, drive!
[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy zoom off in the Invisible Boat Mobile]
SpongeBob: We're all alone, Patrick. No lights. No shelter.
[both sobbing. Then, it is dawn and the sun rises]
Patrick: Huh? SpongeBob, there's a really big light! I'll go get it, buddy!
[He runs up a beam of light to the sun]
SpongeBob: Pat! Come ba... [He yawns and falls asleep on Patrick's rock. Then, Patrick comes down from the sun, his butt ends up flaming]
Patrick: [screams] Too much light! Too much light! [screams]

  
 [It's another day at Mrs. Puff's Boating School as SpongeBob skids along his way to failing his driving test again]
 French Narrator: Here we are again at the Bikini Bottom Boating School. Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year, [cut to a shot of SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff's car coming straight to the camera] ...and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means another [starts going into a screaming tone] whole yeAR OF BOATING SCHOOL!! [Shows a static scene as SpongeBob crashes into the camera and glass breaks. Back on regular view, the cameraman is seen to have fallen over. The French Narrator groans.]
 SpongeBob: ...whahappened?
 Mrs. Puff: Oh, nothing SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian. [writes on clipboard] Minus 20 more points.
 SpongeBob: How many does that leave me with?
 Mrs. Puff: Negative 224.
 SpongeBob: How many more minutes left in the test?
 Mrs. Puff: The test is over.
 SpongeBob: That's enough time, I can make up those points! [Sponge is about to pull into reverse]
 Mrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me! [the boat rams into reverse and Mrs. Puff screams.] It's too late, SpongeBob! [Mrs. Puff pleads Sponge to stop as Sponge knocks over a whole row of cones, knocks through a brick wall and crashes in front of the school's main building. The dust clears]
 SpongeBob: OK, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?
 Mrs. Puff: 6.
 SpongeBob: Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?
 Mrs. Puff: Six.
 SpongeBob: [raising arms slowly] Whooooooooooooo...
 Mrs. Puff: Hundred. [SpongeBob stops]
 SpongeBob: What?
 Mrs. Puff: 600. You need 600 to pass. You got 6.
 SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll be all right Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year! [he slams his fist down, which causes a piece of the motor to fly upward] Well, see you next Tuesday! [Sponge walks off and the piece crashes on Mrs. Puff. She inflates like she always does when Sponge crashes. SpongeBob runs out to his unicycle-like bike] Yeah! [singing] I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year. [goes around in circles on his bike] One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year! [Mrs. Puff looks on, still inflated]
 Mrs. Puff: [thinking] Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole! [starts to talk, when she does, she deflates to her normal size] Extra crediiiiit!
 SpongeBob: What was that, Mrs. Puff? [Mrs. Puff runs over and shakes him in joy]
 Mrs. Puff: Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit! [laughing wildly] I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.
 SpongeBob: What's extra credit?
 Mrs. Puff: It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.
 SpongeBob: [singing] Oh….. [cut to Sponge at his desk]
 Mrs. Puff: Now, are we ready for that extra credit?
 SpongeBob: Extra credit!
 Mrs. Puff: That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a 10-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.
 SpongeBob: But I've learned so many things.
 Mrs. Puff: Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started. [SpongeBob writes what she says] "What I learned in boating school is…" There! That's already 7 words! Only 3 more!
 SpongeBob: [writing] L… e… a… r… [pencil snaps] Oh, barnacles.
 Mrs. Puff: What's wrong?
 SpongeBob: Got to sharpen my pencil. [Sponge whistles as he walks to the sharpener. He then sharpens it multiple times to get just the right sharpness. Mrs. Puff begins to sweat. Sponge is finally satisfied and walks back to his desk] N… e… [pencil breaks again, he walks to the sharpener again, Mrs. Puff stops him, grabs the pencil and holds out a pen]
 Mrs. Puff: Give me that! Here's a pen.
 SpongeBob: A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils. [walks back to desk singing] Gonna write an essay, that's what I say. [SpongeBob finishes] There.
 Mrs. Puff: Fantastic, let me see it.
 SpongeBob: No, wait! I changed my mind! [erases some stuff out]
 Mrs. Puff: I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see. [Sponge jumps on top of his paper]
 SpongeBob: Don't look! It's not ready.
 Mrs. Puff: It's so simple, only 10 words! "What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity, [her eyes grow bulging veins] Blank!"
 SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!
 Mrs. Puff: "What I learned in boating school is…!" "What I learned in boating school is…!"
 SpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this! [starts to pant] Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here? [screams] My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop! [Mrs. Puff jumps on Sponge and forces the pen to push on the paper]
 Mrs. Puff: You only need 3… more… words! [the desk finally collapses and breaks. Mrs. Puff reaches for the essay] OK, let me see what you've written. [SpongeBob grabs on]
 SpongeBob: It's not ready yet.
 Mrs. Puff: It's OK, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.
 SpongeBob: No!
 Mrs. Puff: Give it to me! [the 2 pull on it]
 SpongeBob: No!
 Mrs. Puff: Let me see it! [the page rips in half. Mrs. Puff grabs Sponge's piece and attempts to read it] "What I learned in boating school is…" Uh… [on the page, it says 'What I learned in boating school is how to drive.' 'School,' 'how' and 'drive are crossed out and below are pictures of a boat, Sponge and a jellyfish] Well, the rest doesn't matter! [throws the 2 pieces on the floor] You pass! [laughs] You pass!
 SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.
 Mrs. Puff: That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.
 SpongeBob: Really?
 Mrs. Puff: Besides, here's your license. [gives it to SpongeBob]
 SpongeBob: My license! [licks it] It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-
 Mrs. Puff: [dragging him out the door] Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!
 SpongeBob: Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants! [echoes] SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants! [fades to a vision of Mrs. Puff's fears] La La La La! [he hits many pedestrians] La La La La! [he crashes through Harold and Frank]
 Fish: [crushed by the bus when SpongeBob hits it] Ow!
 [A small birthday party is going on]
 Partygoers: Harris, happy birthday! [SpongeBob runs over them] My leg!
 News Reporter: So much destruction...this reporter asks, "Why?" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who- [SpongeBob runs him over] OOF!
 SpongeBob: La la la la!
 Reporter: Let's- not- use that take. [Fades to reality]
 Mrs. Puff: That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive. [Later that night while walking home] Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.
 [she opens the door and turns on the light to see the SquarePants Family standing in the center of her living room with a huge round cake in the middle saying, "Thank You, Mrs. Puff! "]
 The SquarePants': Surprise!
 SpongeBob: To the greatest teacher ever!
 Mr. SquarePants: Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family. [kisses her hand for a long while]
 Mrs. SquarePants: I think you made your point, Dear.
 Mr. SquarePants: Ahem. [blushes, and walks back to the family] Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!
 Mrs. Puff: Well, I...Okay.
 Mrs. SquarePants: We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...
 Mrs. Puff: See what?
 Mr. SquarePants: Ta-da. [reading back license plate: "IM-RDY"]
 Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob: A brand new boatmobile?!
 SpongeBob: For me...? [faints and hits the cake, cutting out a perfect square. The family is in the car ready to drive away with SpongeBob still passed out in the backseat]
 Mrs. SquarePants: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff...he'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!
 Mrs. Puff: What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name...! No. Not again! I've got to end this before it begins.
 [In SpongeBob's bedroom, he's laying in bed with his parents overlooking him]
 Mr. SquarePants: You took quite a buster there, son.
 SpongeBob: What I learned in Boating School today is!
 Mr. SquarePants: We're gonna hafta hold off on the driving there for a while, son.
 Mrs. SquarePants: That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat!
 [SpongeBob peeks out to see if it's all clear, then slides through the window and floats to his new boat]
 SpongeBob: Hi, Boaty. [he runs his hand on the side of the boat and gasps] Boaty, you're cold! [he stands up and lays his socks on the side of the door] Take my socks. [he jumps on the side and hugs it] Oh Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea! [he kisses the throttle lever, sighs, then falls asleep. On the horizon, a shifty dark figure runs by. It's Mrs. Puff, wearing a black ski mask. She peeks over and jumps into the boat, checking to see if the coast is clear]
 Mrs. Puff: I hope I still remember how to do this. [she takes out a purple balloon and blows it up. She then forms it into a balloon animal and snickers to herself] Hehehe yeah… [she starts the boat and drives off. What she doesn't know is that she's sitting on an asleep SpongeBob. He wakes up and sees the sky moving]
 SpongeBob: Hey, I'm driving! [the two notice each other]
 SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff: Aaaaahhhhhh!

[Mrs. Puff skids off the road for a bit, then returns to normal]

 SpongeBob: [jumps up] Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SKIING! [gasp] Oh my gosh, I know who you are!
 Mrs. Puff: [nervous] No, you don't! You don't know who I am!
 SpongeBob: Yes I do! I know that you're...a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray. [takes it out. He sprays, but it's pointed the wrong way and it gets in his eyes and he screams] Somebody help me!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!! [Mrs. Puff kicks SpongeBob out of the boat]
 Mrs. Puff: Sorry SpongeBob, but it was for your own good. [we see SpongeBob supposedly running next to the boat, but he's actually riding his bike. Mrs. Puff speeds up faster and loses him]
 SpongeBob: Give me back my boat! [SpongeBob finally catches up to Mrs. Puff and slaps his hand on the windshield. He grabs with both hands and jumps up. Mrs. Puff skids and swerves to get him off but he's not budging] You'd better stop this boat! [Mrs. Puff slams the brake and SpongeBob falls to the ground. He's still hanging on and running] I'm not letting go. Nothing will stop me! Not even… [gasps. He sees a sign reading…] Giant clams?!?! [so, SpongeBob is dragged through a field of giant clams. He comes out with a bunch of pieces missing from him] I'm… not… letting… go! Even for… [gasps, when he sees another sign for…] CHEESE GRATERS!?! [so he skids through the cheese graters. Now he's just three yellow sponge strands with arms] If you think I'll let go for a little… [he then approaches the most dreaded sign of them all…] EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION?!?!?!?! OH, NOOO!!!! [cut back to Mrs. Puff]
 Mrs. Puff: Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes. [she turns on the radio, which bears a striking resemblance to SpongeBob. It is SpongeBob, in the shape of a radio: his eyes are knobs, mouth the speaker, and so on]
 SpongeBob as Radio: And now back to K.R.U.D. with all of your personal "you won't get away with stealing my car!" hits! [Mrs. Puff screams as SpongeBob squeezes out of the box and jumps on Mrs. Puff. They get into a giant brawl and the car goes out of control. Two cops look on]
 Cop 1: Hey, look. [the car then flies off a cliff and straight for the squad car. The two policemen scream as they are now scared out of their wits. While plummeting, SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff are still brawling]
 SpongeBob: I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were… [he rips off the ski mask, revealing who the culprit is] … Mrs. Puff!?! [SpongeBob flaps his lips in disbelief in a hypnotic background as the car crashes into the police car. Seconds later, the siren goes off. Later, SpongeBob is calling Mrs. Puff on the phone. Every time a person talks, it cuts to them] So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?
 Mrs. Puff: Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to… apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.
 SpongeBob: So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?
 Mrs. Puff: I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.
 SpongeBob: You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student [cut to see that Mrs. Puff is talking to SpongeBob from jail, through that visiting window]. And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?
 Mrs. Puff: What's that? [pan out from the jail exterior]
 SpongeBob: [from inside] Free driving lessons! [laughs]


[SpongeBob is trying to open the door, but Patrick is sleeping outside and blocking his door. SpongeBob tries to push the door, he opens the door slightly, looks at Patrick]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
[SpongeBob closes the door, Patrick's head falls down, which makes him wake up]
SpongeBob: What are you doing out here, silly?
Patrick: I'm waiting for you, so we can play the day away! [grumbles] Oh, barnacles! You're wearing that dumb hat, again! Every time you wear that stupid thing, you're, you're gone for the whole day!
SpongeBob: That's because this is my work hat, Patrick. I have to wear it when I go to work.
Patrick: Why don't you just take it off so you don't have to go to work today?
SpongeBob: [laughs] I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, buddy.
Patrick: Ugh! I hate that hat! [Patrick throws SpongeBob's hat, but it flies back onto SpongeBob's head] Fine, have it your way, hat! [Squidward walks out] Hmph. Looks like Squidward has time to play. Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: What? [puts on hat]
Patrick: Oh no! He's got the hat, too!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. I'll be back from work at six. We can play then.
Patrick: I'll show you, SpongeBob! I'll get a job and a hat!
[Cuts to the Krusty Krab, where a kid is adding ketchup to his fries]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa, whoa, that's enough, lad! What do ya think, I'm made of ketchup? Now run along, boy. [Notices a group of tourists] Eh? That sounds like... a band of roving tourists! [Runs out of the Krusty Krab] Wait, come back! Don't ya wanna give me your money?! They're a slippery bunch. What do I have to do to catch 'em, stand around out here all day? [Notices Patrick] What are you doing there, Patrick? 
Patrick: Standin' around out here all day.
[Mr. Krabs gets an idea]
Mr. Krabs: How would you like a job, Patrick?
Patrick: Oh boy, gimme my hat!
Mr. Krabs: You'll get your hat, but first you have to entice people into the restaurant by standin' right here and holdin' this sign. [Mr. Krabs hands Patrick an arrow-shaped sign saying "The Krusty Krab"] That's not too tough for ya, is it, boy?
Patrick: Sounds complicated, but if it gets me a work hat. [Holds up the sign] How's this?
Mr. Krabs: Perfect. You'll be wearin' that hat in no time at all. [From inside the Krusty Krab] Hee hee hee.
SpongeBob: What's shakin', Mr. K?
Mr. Krabs: Your buddy, Patrick. I hired him to stand out there and hold that sign.
SpongeBob: Oh, he is good.
Mr. Krabs: And look. He's about reel in his first customer.
Harold: Can you direct me to the Krusty Krab please? [Patrick holds the sign so it's pointing at the Chum Bucket. Harold walks into the Chum Bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: What does he think he's doing?! [Multiple fish walk past Patrick] They're walkin' right past him! [Runs outside to Patrick] Patrick, you need to get their attention, boy.
Patrick: Okay. [Hits a fish in the head with the sign]
Mr. Krabs: That ain't the kind of attention we need! Why don't you show a little razzle-dazzle, maybe give the sign a little twirl or something? [Spins the sign, causing it to fly out of Patrick's hands. Hands the sign back to Patrick] Just keep workin' on that one, eh, boy? Listen, if any tourists come by, why don't you blow them away with a little extra twirl?
Patrick: Anything for my new hat.
[Patrick sees tourists approaching, so he spins the sign very fast. The wind is so intense that a window opens, and a tourist's camera gets blown away]
Mr. Krabs: That's enough, Patrick!
[Mr. Krabs and the tourists get blown away]
Patrick: I did it! Did you see that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I saw it.
Patrick: Do I get my hat now?
Mr. Krabs: What the heck. It pays to advertise. [Gives Patrick a Krusty Krab hat]
Patrick: My hat...  [Then Patrick falls on his face, gets back up and falls down again]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's wrong with him?
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Patrick?
Patrick: I dunno. Sometimes, when I'm nervous, I forget how to stand.
SpongeBob: He's nervous.
Blue Fish: Ha ha ha! Look at that guy! He doesn't know how stand on his own two feet!
Pink Fish: Now that's that kind of mindlessness I'd pay money to see!
[Mr. Krabs looks at them, then neck stretches out over to them]
Mr. Krabs: You mean, cash money?
Pink Fish: Well, heck, yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Five dollars please. All right!
Mr. Krabs: There's that sound again! They're loving it! Patrick, you've captured the attention of all these tourists with your ridiculous flapdoodle!
Patrick: I did?
Mr. Krabs: That's right, I think we've finally found a job you're good at. Being an absolute buffoon! If it's folly you crave, it can be found exclusively at the Krusty Krab! For just five dollars a head.
[Bubble transition. Patrick falls and everybody is laughing and cheering]
Squidward: It's official. [everyone is still laughing] I hate everyone. [Patrick falls into the kitchen] You imbeciles think that's entertainment? Well, brace yourselves for some true entertainment! [plays his clarinet off-key]
SpongeBob: Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Are you okay?
Patrick: I'm fine.
Pink fish: Oh, that horrible noise! Let's get out of here! [customers begin to leave]
Mr. Krabs: What the barnacles is going on out here?!
Squidward: I'm entertaining these heathens.
Mr. Krabs: We've got all the entertainment we need, thank you very much! [points to Patrick, but he's not there] Where'd he go?
SpongeBob: [guiding Patrick, who has a tissue in his nose] Come on, Patrick. Easy now. Right this way.
Mr. Krabs: What in the name of Neptune is going on here?!
SpongeBob: Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, a bloody nose, eh? You think I was born yesterday? He doesn't even have a nose. Now get back to work, the all of ya's! I'm not running a happy factory here! [SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick get back into there positions. to Patrick] Keep up the good work, Patrick!
Patrick: You got it, Mr. K!
French Narrator: 7 hours later...
[Patrick is still falling and three customers are watching as Billy passes by]
Billy: That guy still flopping?
Customer: Yeah! Amazing, isn't it?
Billy: Doesn't that get old?
Customer: He's got a point. Let's get out of here.
Billy: Me, too. I'm out. [everyone's leaving]
Mr. Krabs: What? Wait! Don't go! Why ya leaving?
Harold: This guy's act is stale! We crave excitement!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, okay! You want excitement? Well, what if I added a box? [puts Patrick on a box and he falls from it]
Billy: Sort of the same, really.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, okay, so what if he flopped from two boxes...? [adds another box, but the customers are still bored] ...into a cream pie? [puts cream pie in place]
Patrick: I like pie.
Billy: That, I'd pay to see! [crowd becomes excited]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, let 'er rip! [Patrick falls headfirst into the pie. To Squidward] I'll be in the back counting me money. If the crowd gets bored, add some more boxes!
Squidward: Whatever.
SpongeBob: Hey, hat man... How are you feeling after your first day on the job?
Patrick: [feels morbidly disheveled] I feel like a million bucks... [falls over]
SpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick, are you all right? Say something! [Patrick mumbles incoherently] Okay, that's it! No best friend of mine is gonna suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr Krabs can make a quick buck! I'm gonna go have a talk with him right-
Patrick: [Grabs SpongeBob] No! P-please, don't tell Mr. Krabs! You don't understand. For years, people have been telling me, “You're no good!” Now I'm good! I have a hat to prove it! I don't wanna go back to being No Hat Patrick! [He cries]
SpongeBob: Okay, buddy, I understand. Just promise me one thing.
Patrick: What's that, pal?
SpongeBob: Just be careful.
Patrick: [Hugs him] Thanks, pal.
[Cut to SpongeBob walking to work]
SpongeBob: I'm worried about Patrick. I'm not sure his new job is good for him. [Enters the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is dressed in a suit and speaking through a megaphone]
Mr. Krabs: See the part time minimum wage employee fall from high atop this tower into this bucket of spiny sea urchins!
Sandals: This should be good.
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: [Being hauled to top of the platform] Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you can't let him do this, he might get hurt!
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, boy, he signed a waiver. [Shows it to him] Is he ready, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Ready!
Mr. Krabs: Okay! Step back, boy, you wouldn’t want to stain your uniform.
Patrick: Hey, good idea. Squidward, could you hold me hat so it won't get hurt? [gives hat to Squidward] Thanks, buddy.
Mr. Krabs: Ready, Patrick?
Patrick: Ready! [Prepares to dive from the platform]
SpongeBob: Oh, I can't watch! [Cries and blows his nose on Harold's fin]
Harold: Hey, ew!
[tries to fall several times, fails]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, Patrick! We've got a perfectly good bucket of spiny sea urchins down here!
Patrick: I'm trying!
[tries to fall several times, fails again]
Patrick: Argh, I think I'm stuck!
Mr. Krabs: Stuck? Well, if that don't … [Mumbles angrily and climbs a ladder to the platform] What's the holdup, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Don't look at me, I'm just here to hold his hat.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick, why have you stopped falling?
Patrick: I dunno, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you'd better figure it out! These people paid good money for a floor show full of pain and humiliation! Now make with the codswallop, pal, understand?
Patrick: Uh-huh.
Mr. Krabs: Don't make me come back here.
Patrick: Hey, Squidward, d'you think you could, uh, you know … [Mimes pushing]
Squidward: You want me to push you off your precarious perch into a bucket of spiny sea urchins? Oh, if only you were SpongeBob. Okay, I'll do it! [He charges at Patrick, but misses and falls]
Patrick: Thanks, Squidward! Oh, my hat! Gotcha! All right, back where you belong, aaaah! [Grabs hat puts it on and falls].
Harold: Great, we get to see two for the price of one!
Mr. Krabs: I don't think so.
Harold: Fine. [Pays Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you.
Patrick: Look, Squidward, I'm falling!
Squidward: Oh, I'm so happy for you!
Patrick: I figured it out; it's the hat that makes me fall, it makes me top heavy!
[They crash into the urchin bucket]
SpongeBob: So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time!
Nat: I paid to see two guys get maimed!
Harold: Yeah, I want a refund!
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, absolutely no refunds. [customers grumble] Hold on there, what's the big idea? [Customers tear up his clothes and money flies in the air] Grandma, help! [he is in his underwear. To Patrick] All right, you leave me no choice!
Patrick: You're giving me a raise?
Mr. Krabs: Not even close. You're fired. [takes Patrick’s hat, Patrick’s head has a lump] As long as I'm still standing, you’ll never wear this hat again.
[Patrick sobs with his hands covering his eyes]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you okay?
Patrick: Well, I guess it's back to being to No Hat Pat! [walks out sadly]
Narrator: Epilogue.
SpongeBob: [Walking home with Patrick] It's okay, Patrick, not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents. But you can wear mine any time you want.
Patrick: Really?
SpongeBob: Sure thing, pal.
[gives Patrick his hat]
Patrick: [He puts it on and falls over] Thanks, SpongeBob! You're the best!
SpongeBob: Anytime, pal! Anytime!


[Episode starts with Squidward walking home. He places his keys on the table, and puts down a bag that says "Nautical Mart" on it. He then takes some stuff out]
Squidward: I thought I told that kid not to put the organic sea cucumber on top of the free range anemones! Well, at least my flowers survived the trip. [Squidward sniffs it, then SpongeBob's nose is in his nostril. Squidward screams, then sneezes him out] SpongeBob, would you please find your own flowers to sniff?!
SpongeBob: What about Patrick? Does he have to find his own flowers, too? [Patrick pops up from the flowers, and they die]
Squidward: What are you talking about, nitwit? He doesn't even have a nose!
Patrick: Of course I have a nose, Squidward. Why, it's as plain as the nose on my... [human hands touch his face, then he talks sadly] ...face? [Patrick touches Squidward's nose, then his face, then SpongeBob's nose] You're right, Squidward! [cries]
Squidward: My floors! Think fast, Squiddy. I've got your nose.
Patrick: You do?
Squidward: Yeah. I've got it... [Squidward touches Patrick's face, and holds his thumb, looking like a nose] ...right here.
Patrick: Give me! Give it here!
Squidward: If you want it, you gotta go get it. [pretends to throw it, then they run outside, and Squidward shuts the door. They then look around]
Patrick: There! [Patrick picks up a shell] Well, SpongeBob, what do you think of my new nose?
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's not a nose, that's a... [a hermit crab bites him and Patrick yelps] ...hermit crab.
Patrick: I guess I'll always be a noseless freak. [cuts to them walking down the street]
SpongeBob: It's not so abnormal to be noseless. Just look around. Lots of fish don't have noses.
Patrick: Yeah, but all my friends have noses. You, Squidward, Sandy, even Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs walks on screen sniffing around, then sees a penny]
Mr. Krabs: There you are! [picks it up and continues sniffing]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face?
Patrick: I can do that? [cuts to Patrick with a false nose tied on him]
Surgeon: Well, what do you think?
Patrick: Sorry, doc. I don't really think it's me.
Surgeon: That's a-okay. That's cool. As lead surgeon here, I take a hypothetical oath. Which means I will not stop, I will not rest, I will not cut a single toenail, until the customer is 100% satisfied! So please, browse our extensive wall of noses! And I will patiently await your final decision.
Patrick: Okay! Let's see. Hmm. [looks around]
Surgeon: Excellent choice! [puts him on a medical bed. Scene cuts to him walking out of the nose store, with a nose bandaged up]
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick, let's unveil the new schnoze! [tries to pull off the bandages, but Patrick stops him]
Patrick: Wait, stop, careful, SpongeBob! This fragile stitching requires tender care. Allow me to carefully remove the bandages. [Patrick crushes his nose, then pulls off the bandages, then uses a cooking mixer, then a sander]
SpongeBob: There it is, Patrick! Your brand new sniffer! Looking good buddy! [silence for a few seconds] Well, I've gotta go to work now. Have fun with your new nose.
Patrick: I will! Now, how do I use this thing? [smells something] What is that smell? [walks over to a bakery] Pastries? I never knew they smelled so good! [sticks his face in and sniffs them]
Fred: Well, I guess I won't be eating those. [cuts to Squidward walking out of the Nautical Mart with more flowers]
Squidward: Let's see Patrick destroy these. [Patrick sniffs them all in his nose, then he is sitting on a lawn mower smelling the grass, then putting on deodorant, and sniffing his arm pit. He then smells some bread, and floats toward it. He then floats through a cloud of perfume a lady is putting on]
Patrick: All these years I knew I was missing out on something, but I never thought smelling could be this good! [Patrick smells a bad smell, then falls] What is that horrible smell? [notices something] Onion rings? [sniffs them, then screams and covers his nose] The scent! Nobody told me about bad smells! [a bad smell taps him on the shoulder] What is it now? [Patrick sniffs some trash, then runs away from the stench] I'm going to have to re-think this whole smelling thing. [runs into his rock, and the smell vanishes. Patrick sits in his chair] I made it. At least here at home, I can't be attacked by those wretched odors. [Patrick smells a bad smell again] Bad smells are all around me! [takes a look at all the trash. His eyes then water up, and he runs outside] I cannot live in these conditions! [puts a mask on his nose, then gets some cleaning spray and a brush. He then runs to his rock to clean it]
Narrator: 48 hours later... [Patrick's house is really clean, and he is still cleaning]
SpongeBob: Hiya, Patrick. How... Whoa! Hey, looking good.
Patrick: Oh, the smells! They're everywhere! It's unbearable! [cries and Patrick's crying sounded like Squidward, then Squidward walks on screen]
Squidward: What's wrong with the pinhead? [Patrick smells something, and screams]
Patrick: Oh, it's another one! No! I can't take it!
Squidward: Where do you think you're going?
Patrick: To do what should have been done long ago. [barges into Squidward's house, then smells something, and opens his fridge, revealing bad smelling cheese [Ädelost?], then screams] Sweet Neptune, imported cheese! [runs off screen, then comes back with a mask and sack] This is inexcusable! [puts it in the sack] Yuck!
Squidward: What are you doing with my cheese?
Patrick: It's rotten garbage now. [throws it in the garbage, then blasts it with a rocket launcher] That's better.
Squidward: That was my cheese. It's supposed to smell like that, kelp for brains!
Patrick: You are sick, Squidward. [Patrick smells another bad smell] Bad smell again! [Patrick looks out the window, and we see SpongeBob working out]
SpongeBob: 1, 2, 3, 4... [has trouble lifting the weight again] Come on, SquarePants, be a man! [lifts it up]
Patrick: You! [SpongeBob is scared, and drops the weight on him]
SpongeBob: Patrick, help!
Patrick: [throws the weight off him] Oh, I'll help you, all right! Help stop you from polluting our world with your sweaty holes. [plugs up SpongeBob's holes with corks] There.
SpongeBob: I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this. I'm out of uniform.
Patrick: Well, you can't go to work smelling like that. You should be thanking me, SpongeBob. [smells another bad smell] Smells like... something greasy. [cuts to the Krusty Krab] Nobody moves! I am ridding this place of its disgusting stench with these scented candles! [puts a candle on a table. Fred tries to eat a Krabby Patty, but can't]
Fred: [coughs] My mouth can't take these conflicting flavors! Agh! [walks away, then Patrick puts scented candles on every table]
Patrick: This air freshener should finish the job. [sprays it, then everyone coughs. Patrick then puts a candle on the cashier boat]
Mr. Krabs: What the barnacles do you think you're doing?! You're chasing away all me customers! [everyone leaves]
Patrick: Well, good! No one should have to eat in this stench!
Mr. Krabs: [outraged at what Patrick has just said] What?! Why, I got a good mind to...
Patrick: Say no more, you can thank me later. Right now, I've got many more stink holes to swab clean.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that new honker of his has turned him into a complete jerk! [Patrick walks outside, and Sandy walks past him]
Sandy: Hiya, Pat. [Patrick sprays Sandy with the air freshener. Sandy screams, then coughs]
Patrick: Take a bath, fleabag! [cuts to the Krusty Krab. Where Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Sandy, and SpongeBob are there]
Mr. Krabs: I've asked you all here because we all face a similar problem. The problem bein' a sea star with a nose that's gotten way out of hand! [all except SpongeBob agree]
Squidward: You got that right, yeah!
Sandy: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Now what I want to know is, are we going to do something about it!? [all except SpongeBob agree again]
Squidward: You bet we're gonna do, yeah!
Sandy: Yeah, sure are!
Squidward: Let's give him what for!
Sandy: Let's hogtie him and run him out of town on a rail! [all, except SpongeBob agree again]
SpongeBob: [in thought bubble] Come on, SpongeBob, be a man! [talking] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Not now boy! We're in the middle of a public listen! That no-good, nose-flartin...
SpongeBob: It is not Patrick's fault!
All: Huh?
SpongeBob: It's the new nose that has betrayed us. My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man. But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks! [cuts to them pushing a giant stinky ball toward Patrick's house, in air suits, so they won't smell it] Okay, this should be stinky enough. I've gathered every sweaty sock, moldy pizza, and rotten piece of fruit in Bikini Bottom. [puts a nasty slimy messy pepper on the garbage ball] With a little raw sewage for good measure.
Mr. Krabs: Ata' boy! Now for the moment of truth!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [knocks on Patrick's rock and runs away]
Patrick: Hello. [smells the bad smell, casing his nose to cough, then dry and shrivel out] No! [his nose than falls off, then vanishes] All I wanted was to be able to smell like the rest of you. [runs away crying, then cuts to a cemetery] 
SpongeBob: [reading tombstone] Here lies the nose of Patrick Star. R.I.P. [referring to the R.I.P] Well, this is terrible! All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it.
Squidward: Who cares? At least now that pink moron will leave us alone.
Patrick: I heard that! [moves to Patrick with giant human ears]


Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon, a luxurious oasis of sand and sea. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Sandy next to a tent]
Sandy: Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimmin' when you're in a shirt and tie?
SpongeBob: Ah, yes. How foolish of me. [cackles] Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit. [goes into the tent, then pokes his head out] And I won't do anything else. [puts his head back in]
Sandy: SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah! [puts on his headgear that was in the bag] Hi-yah! [puts on his karate gloves that was in the bag] Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah! [kicks the bag]
Sandy: SpongeBob, are you ready?
SpongeBob: Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready! [softly] Ready to get it on. [jumps out of the tent towards Sandy] Hi...
Sandy: Hi-yah! [kicks SpongeBob in his mouth] Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear.
SpongeBob: [muffled laughter] Great minds think alike, I suppose.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops him into the air. SpongeBob crashes into the ground, followed by his pants, socks, and shoes. He stands up with the clothing on his head and feet in some food]
SpongeBob: I may be down, but I'm not out! [looks down at his feet, which are in some potato salad at a family picnic]
Tom: Way to go, buddy. It took us three days to make that potato salad. [SpongeBob jumps away] Three days!
SpongeBob: [jumps into an empty area] Hi-yah! Sandy?
Sandy: Oh, I'm Sandy, alright. [her arms come out of the ground and squish SpongeBob's face] I'm very Sandy. [kicks SpongeBob into the air] Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it. She's "Sandy." That's her name; she's also covered in... yes! [flies out of the water then back into it. Scene cuts to Sandy talking to an ice cream vendor]
Sandy: Back in Texas, we call ice cream "frozen cow juice". Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob in the face with her karate glove] Thank you.
Ice Cream Vendor: No, no, thank you.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [slaps SpongeBob again, sending him into the air and flying into a strong fish that is waiting in line]
Tough Fish #1: [growls] Who threw that piece of paper at me? [SpongeBob stammers and whistles]
Sandy: Hey, what's everybody waitin' in line for?
Tough Fish #1: Ahoy, fair lass, it be the line to get into the Salty Spitoon — [points over to an old building] the roughest, toughest sailor club ever to be built under the seven seas. Only the baddest of the bad can get in. You need to have muscles. [flexes his arm] You need to have muscles on your muscles. [flexes, even more, created more muscles on his previous ones] You need to have muscles on your eyeballs! [flexes his eyes, creating muscles]
SpongeBob: Ew. [a fish is screaming while flying out of the Salty Spitoon]
Sandy: Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yeah, let's go in.
Reg: [lets a fish walk in] Go ahead. [line moves up] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Tough Fish #1: How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning!
Reg: Yeah, so?
Tough Fish #1: Without any milk.
Reg: Uhh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting. [tough fish walks in. Sandy walks up to Reg] Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Sandy: How tough am I? [rips off one of his tattoos that says "MOM" and puts it upside down back where it was. Reg screams in pain when Sandy rips off the tattoo]
SpongeBob: Wow.
Sandy: Got any more tattoos? [Reg covers the upside down tattoo with his arms]
Reg: Uhh, that won't be necessary. Go ahead.
Sandy: Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob! [walks in]
Reg: How tough are ya?
SpongeBob: How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
Reg: Sure. [hands the bottle of ketchup to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: It's on! [strains to open it, but he can't] If I could just run this under some hot water...
Reg: Get outta here. This place is too tough for you, little man.
SpongeBob: Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.
Reg: Listen, kid. I think you'd be more comfortable over at that place. [points to the building across the street]
SpongeBob: Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg: Uhh. Oh, no, sorry, I was actually pointing at the place next to it. [points to another building]
SpongeBob: Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
Reg: Yeah. Unless you think you're tough enough to fight me. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob sitting in a seat at Weenie Hut Jr's]
Nerd #1: How's your collection coming along?
Nerd #2: Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty sweet. I'm in the process of acquiring issue 347 which will give me my fourth complete set.
Nerd #1: No...
SpongeBob: [snorts] What weenies. Oh, brother.
Robot: [robotic voice] Would you care for another diet cola with a lemon twist, weenie?
SpongeBob: What? But I'm not a weenie! [the robot scans SpongeBob with one of its scanners]
Robot: I'm sorry, sir, but my sensors indicate that you are indeed a weenie. [computer beeps and shows a picture of a hot dog weenie with the word "YES" below it]
SpongeBob: That's impossible! [the two nerds look at him. He runs off]
Robot: You can't hide what's inside.
SpongeBob: [runs over to Reg] I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie! [a strong, orange fish walks up]
Tough Fish #4: Hey, Reg, how's it going? [SpongeBob screams in surprise and he jumps onto Reg's arms.]
Reg: You were sayin'? [to orange fish] Go ahead, buddy.
Tough Fish #4: Thanks, Reg. [walks in]
SpongeBob: So, your name's Reg?
Reg: [throws SpongeBob aside] Would you get outta here?
SpongeBob: Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will! [runs off. Scene cuts to Weenie Hut Jr's]
Nerd #1: Couldn't get in, huh? What you need is a tough hairdo. No one gets into the Double S without a tough hairdo.
Nerd #2: I disagree, I saw a guy going in there and he was bald.
Nerd #1: I saw that guy. He wasn't bald. He had a shaved head. Shaved — that's a hairdo. Case closed. [both fish notice SpongeBob is gone] Hey, where'd he go?
Robot: I believe he said something about going to the wig store.
Nerd #1: Ha-ha! Check and mate. [Someone who looks like SpongeBob walks over to Reg with a cool, black wig on]
Drifter: What's shakin', my man?
Reg: Not much. Say, haven't I seen you before?
Drifter: Doubt it — I'm a drifter — just blew into town. Heard your club was pretty tough, thought I'd check it out.
Reg: Nice try, kid. I know it's you.
Drifter: What're you talking about? [Reg pulls Drifter's hair, but it is still attached to his head, it's real hair]
Reg: Aha! [the hair does not come off. SpongeBob walks up with a clown wig on]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody, what's goin' on? [the Drifter gets angry as Reg tries to redo his hair, but can't do it]
Reg: Ah, you can go in. Sorry about that. [Drifter angrily walks in] Well, what do you want?
SpongeBob: I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order. [Reg takes the wig off SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob laughs nervously] So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate? [a big, green fish walks up with a tattoo of a seahorse on his right arm]
Tough Fish #5: Hey-ya, Reg.
Reg: Alright, now it's a party! Oh, yeah, check out the new ink.
Tough Fish #5: Thanks. Hey, look what I can make it do. [moves his arm, which makes the seahorse tattoo wiggle]
Reg: [chuckles] Yeah. Hey, what about that one? [big, green fish looks at his left arm that has a SpongeBob tattoo on it]
Tough Fish #5: Huh, you know, I don't remember getting this one.
Reg: Can you make it dance?
Tough Fish #5: Well, here, let me try. [moves his arm. SpongeBob dances]
Reg: Hmmm, wait a minute. [rips SpongeBob off his arm] Go ahead in. [the tattoo fish walks in, rubbing his left arm]
Tough Fish #5: Yeah, sure, Reg. Thanks.
Reg: Nice try, little man. [throws SpongeBob to the back of the line behind two strong fish]
Tough Fish #6: Hey, I was in front of you!
Tough Fish #7: No, you weren't!
Tough Fish #6: You callin' me a liar?
Tough Fish #7: I ain't callin' you for dinner! [two start fighting. SpongeBob tries to run away, but the fight goes downhill, with him in it. Reg walks over]
Reg: Hold it, you two! That's enough, you're both plenty tough, go ahead in.
Tough Fish #6: Alright!
Tough Fish #7: Thanks, Reg. [both run off as SpongeBob comes out from under the sand]
SpongeBob: Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap. [He dusts his clothes using his hands]
Reg: [chortles] I saw you runnin'. When you get in a real fight, then we'll talk.
SpongeBob: Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch. [spins his legs, then his hands, and then cracks his fingers, but they are snapped in half. The scene cuts out to SpongeBob’s broken fingers. He starts to cry and runs off. Scene cuts to SpongeBob with his fingers in a bowl of ice cream, whimpering]
Robot: Care for another sundae, weenie?
SpongeBob: [jumps angrily] I am not a weenie!
Nerd #1: Relax, you're among friends. [raises his drink]
SpongeBob: My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's. [scroll over to Patrick in the seat next to him]
Patrick: You tell 'em, SpongeBob! [sips his drink]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what're you doing here?
Patrick: I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.
Nerd #1: Actually, they moved Double Weenie Wednesday to Friday.
Nerd #2: And besides, today's Monday.
Patrick: Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?
Nerd #1: Uhh, that's now on Sunday.
Patrick: Barnacles!
Nerd #2: Super Weenie Hut Jr's has a Mega Weenie Monday.
Nerd #1: Uhh, no, you're thinking of Monster Weenie Monday.
SpongeBob: I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon! [begins to walks out]
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous.
SpongeBob: I've got no choice.
Robot: I have a suggestion. Why not fake a fight?
Patrick: Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!
Patrick: Yeah! [both run out]
Nerd #1: Hey, how come you never help us out with our problems?
Robot: I am a robot, not a miracle worker. [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking up to Reg]
SpongeBob: Afternoon, Reg.
Reg: Whoa, whoa, little man. You still can't go in.
SpongeBob: Well, that makes me pretty mad.
Reg: Oh yeah?
SpongeBob: Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
Reg: [sarcastically] Wow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.
Reg: Hmmm... what about that guy? [points to a large muscular fish behind him]
SpongeBob: [gasps and stammers] I, uh... [laughs] don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy! [points to Patrick]
Patrick: Who, me? [SpongeBob walks up to Patrick]
SpongeBob: Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!
Patrick: Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh... [looks at his hand, which has writing on it] ...kickboxer. [winks and gives a thumbs-up to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby! [Patrick starts to tear up]
Patrick: Tubby? [Patrick's sadness is quickly replaced by fury and he snarls with rage] Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby! [punches SpongeBob in the eye, leaving a black mark]
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?
Patrick: Oh yeah. [invisible punches flying] No, please wait. [grunting as more invisible punches hit him and an elephant sound is heard when Patrick's head is hit. Patrick is being thrown into the air and on the ground, then given a wedgie] No, please, have mercy! [Patrick is kicked into the background]
Reg: Wow! You destroyed that guy without even touchin' him. [Patrick is still getting beaten in the background]
SpongeBob: I did?
Reg: I never thought I'd say this, but go ahead in.
SpongeBob: Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life! [walks in as Reg smiles. Scene cuts to an ambulance driving down the street with SpongeBob in bandages and Sandy by his side] Sandy? [groans] What happened?
Sandy: You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube. [ambulance arrives at the hospital. Scene cuts to Sandy wheeling SpongeBob in front of the doctor]
Doctor: What happened?
SpongeBob: I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.
Doctor: Boo-boos, eh? Hmmm... I think you guys want that hospital. [points across the street to Weenie Hut General]
SpongeBob: Weenie Hut General?


[episode begins with a view of Conch Street. Night turns into morning where birds are chirping and SpongeBob laughs which causes Squidward to jump up from his bed and hitting his head through the bed ceiling]
Squidward: Ooh... What the... [groans] ...now?
SpongeBob: La, la, la... [Squidward walks outside to SpongeBob's house] La-la-la, la, la-la-la...
Squidward: [angrily] Stop! [SpongeBob stops] What could you possibly be trying to do this time?
SpongeBob: I'm not trying to do anything. I'm just having a decent morning.
Squidward: By running around and screaming like a banshee?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, a banshee screams like this: [loud scream like a hawk] Ahhhhhhh... [Squidward grabs SpongeBob's mouth]
Squidward: There are two kinds of people. There are people that are normal. [Cuts to a group of real life fish in a tank] And then there's you. [pokes one of SpongeBob's holes]
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Yes, really! Maybe you should start acting a little more... normal!! [walks away and growls] Doh...
SpongeBob: I'm not normal? [Squidward walks back into his house and crawls back into bed] Squidward? [Squidward freaks out when he sees SpongeBob sitting on him] How does one become normal?
Squidward: Well, how about you start by... [Cut to shot of outside Squidward's house where Squidward kicks SpongeBob through the roof] Getting away from me, you little creature!
SpongeBob: What's wrong with me? I need to understand normal! [cuts to inside of SpongeBob's house] "How to be Normal." Hm, this videotape should help.
TV: Are you tired of being called a freak? Do people throw you out of their homes? Well, do they?
SpongeBob: Yes, yes, and yes.
TV: Then join me, as I take you on a "Journey into Normality."
SpongeBob: [transfixed] Normality.
TV: The life of a normal person is rather simple. [Door opens with a fish smiling and dressed professionally for work] Here is your typical average Joe on his way to work. See how he is dressed. [Hair is combed neatly] Even his hair is boring. [Zoom in on the dimples] Notice his features, nice and smooth without a crater or freckle to be seen.
SpongeBob: [rubs his face] Craters and freckles?
TV: In his office space, Mr. Normal, at least that's what it says on his name tag, works at a steady and monotonous pace, just as all the other normals do. Take note of how they communicate with each other.
Other Mr. Normal: Hi, how are you?
TV: At the end of the day, Mr. Normal packs his things and goes home to merrily start the cycle again in the morning.
SpongeBob: Yeah...
[Cut to next day at the Krusty Krab]
Customer: I want one Krabby Patty.
Squidward: Oh, great. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty. [Bells rings as the food tray is presented to Squidward] What, no annoying blurbs today? [Looks through the empty kitchen window] Hmm, strangely quiet. [Walks into the kitchen to get a cup of water, but as he is getting the drink, he notices the office space behind him] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [typing on the computer] Hi, how are ya.
Squidward: What's the meaning of this?
SpongeBob: I took your advice. From now on, I'm normal. [Shows nametag that reads "Hello I'm Normal"]
Squidward: Normal, huh?
SpongeBob: Yup.
Squidward: Oh, really?
SpongeBob: Yup.
Squidward: Whatever. I know you're just waiting to say something stupid.
SpongeBob: Wonderful weather we're having.
Squidward: Uh, yes, it is.
SpongeBob: Okay, see ya 'round. [Goes back to typing]
Squidward: Yeah, I'll, uh...I'll see you. [Door opens]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing sitting around? We need Krabby Patties out there.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. I'll do it... normally.
Mr. Krabs: Eh? [computer beeps. SpongeBob types up an order for 1 Krabby Patty and the machine comes out with one] Wow, that's all it takes these days, huh? Can you do more? [walks to the back of the machine as it shoots hundreds of Krabby Patties at him] Oh, my! It's like printing money! [Cuts to Squidward riding his bike]
Squidward: I wonder what got into SpongeBob... And what the heck is that?! [a normal house is sitting by Squidward's house] Whose house is this?
SpongeBob: [walks up to his house] Hi, how are ya.
Squidward: [slaps himself. Cuts to next day at the Krusty Krab where Squidward walks into the kitchen and greets SpongeBob] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, how are ya.
Squidward: Good, just heading by to get a drink.
SpongeBob: Wonderful weather we're having.
Squidward: It sure is.
SpongeBob: Okay, see ya 'round.
Squidward: Yeah... [chuckles] See ya. [chuckles] Oh, my. [slurps] I could get used to this.
Montage: TBD.
Narrator: Three weeks later...
Squidward: There you are, sir. [watch beeps] Oh, yes, it's time again. I've been meaning to say this, but I've come to appreciate your demeanor lately.
SpongeBob: You know, it's a funny thing, Squidward. I smoothed out the edges of my personality and the rest just followed suit. Now I am utterly normal. [he smiles showing his teeth with no buck tooth. Cuts to a customer biting into his flat Krabby Patty,?but all he is eating is paper. He takes it out of his mouth]
Robbie Fish: Ugh! That ain't right. I will never spend money here again.
Mr. Krabs: Never?
Mevis: Come on, guys, these patties aren't worth the paper they're printed on.
Mr. Krabs: Wait, where're you going? [paper Krabby Patty lands on his nose] SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads. [customers are row out of the restaurant in boats]
SpongeBob: Maybe this thing is out of ink.
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] No, boy, you're missing the point. You can't make Krabby Patties with ink and paper. You gotta put your heart into it, boy. Now get back to making them patties the right way and stop acting so dull.
SpongeBob: What you call dull I call normal.
Mr. Krabs: Well, till you decide to start making them patties the way only you can, I want you out of my place!
SpongeBob: [walks out of the Krusty Krab] I guess the decision to be normal was more life-changing than I thought. [walks up to Patrick who is reading a paper at the bus stop] Hi, how are ya.
Patrick: What happened to you?
SpongeBob: Oh, I got normal.
Patrick: Whatever that means. Hey, SpongeBob, what do you say we charge into Jellyfish Fields nets ablaze? [takes two jellyfish nets out of his pockets]
SpongeBob: Let's do something normal, like window shopping.
Patrick: Let's do this... [groans as he shrinks his head inside of his body and makes it reappear out of the side of his stomach] Ya-ha! Hey, your turn.
SpongeBob: I think I'll pass. But I do need to defragment my hard drive, would you like to help?
Patrick: Hey, listen...when you decide to do something fun, you know where to find me. [walks away with head still out of stomach]
SpongeBob: Okay, see ya 'round. [rings Squidward's door bell] Hi, how are ya.
Squidward: I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but please come in, SpongeBob. [Squidward pours tea into SpongeBob's cup]
SpongeBob: Thank you. Tell me, what are you doing cooped up in here when the weather outside is so normal.
Squidward: Well, today is dusting day. The day I dust my 483 self-portraits.
SpongeBob: Wow, that's something you don't see in the average house.
Squidward: You know, SpongeBob, it's okay to be a little different. [slurps his tea]
SpongeBob: And you know what else is abnormal? Your nose—it's all bulbous and flappy. Your eyes are a little odd, too. Looks like your whole face could use some work. Yeah, there we go. [SpongeBob turns Squidward's face into a real live Squidward face] See? Looking normal already. [woman shrieks]
Squidward: What the...?
SpongeBob: One more thing, Squidward. You don't wear pants. [Squidward kicks him out of his house]
Squidward: And stay out of my home! [slams the door then looks in the mirror and pokes his nose a little]
SpongeBob: Oh, what happened? I lost my job, then my best friend, and now I'm too normal for Squidward. Maybe I have taken this normal thing too far. No problem, SpongeBob. You made yourself normal. Now all you have to do is reweird yourself. All it'll take is a mental adjustment and some tight clenching. Now focus... [groans] and clench. [groans so much his eyes pop out] Oh, well, if I'm going to get weird, I'm going to need to see a professional. [Cuts to Patrick's house]
Patrick: [tongue is twisted around] Look at the tongue. [tongue un-twists itself and Patrick laughs]
SpongeBob: That's very nice, Patrick, but I need you to retrain me. I want to be abnormal again.
Patrick: Huh, I don't think you have what it takes.
SpongeBob: Please, Patrick. If anyone can teach me the arcane art of the weird, it's you. Teach me how to be me again.
Patrick: It won't be easy, but I'll do it.
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Patrick!
Patrick: But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck, and I'll need you to remove your trousers. [Cuts to people laughing at SpongeBob who is only in his underwear]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm feeling very self-conscious right now.
Patrick: [spraying water] Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird. [throws SpongeBob onto the streak of water] See you on the other side, buddy! [SpongeBob grunts as both Patrick and SpongeBob are sliding on a water trail that lead to a ramp on a flatbed truck that launches them into the Bikini Bottom Zoo]
Susie: Mommy, mommy... what are those things?
Shubie: Those are undesirables, honey. We only talk to normal people! [Shubie and her two kids walk off]
Patrick: SpongeBob, the weird therapy is working. Your craters are coming back. We just have to keep pushing the boundaries. We've gotta get stranger. [Cuts to Jellyfish Fields where SpongeBob is riding on Patrick's back like a horse and catches a jellyfish in the net. Another crater comes back. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick licking the sand and as SpongeBob is licking, his nose grows back to normal size. Cuts to Patrick and SpongeBob standing on their hands] Talk backwards.
SpongeBob: Tap erus uoy era? [SpongeBob's legs and arms are back to normal. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick eating secret Krabby Sauce with their feet. SpongeBob's teeth appear. But then something is happening to SpongeBob]
Patrick: It's happening. The final transformation. [SpongeBob transforms back into his normal state]
SpongeBob: Huh?
Patrick: What happened?
SpongeBob: I don't know. I guess I became permanently normal.
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: [sobbing] I don't wanna be normal! [knock on door]
Patrick: Go away!
SpongeBob: Normal is not worth it!
Patrick: We're in mourning! [Patrick also starts sobbing in despair]
Squidward: [Patrick's rock begins to open] It's me, Squidward. I'm looking for SpongeBob. [Squidward is in a normal state] Hi. How are ya? [SpongeBob is so scared and shocked at how Squidward looks that he screams himself back into his regular self]
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're back to your square shape.
SpongeBob: Wow! I guess Squidward's normal looks scared me back to my original form. Thanks, buddy, you saved my life.
Squidward: Wonderful weather we're having, hm?
SpongeBob: It sure is, buddy. It sure is. [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh whilst the episode ends]


[The episode begins at the Bikini Bottom pool.]
Kid #1: It's too high. I can't!
Kid #2: Cannonball! [jumps on the diving board]
Kid #1: Ohh!
[The bigger kid jumps into the pool and causes a big wave, splashing everything. A parent puts water wings on her daughter's arms.]
Water wing girl's mother: Now you've got water wings. Try them. [her daughter flaps her arms and flies up high] Hmm? Huh?
Water wing girl: Ahh-ahh-ahh! [vanishes in the sky]
SpongeBob: [playing Marco Polo with his eyes closed] Marco! [touches a swimmer's back]
Swimmer: Ehh.
SpongeBob: [opens the swimmer's back] Marco?
Joshua: [licking his lollipop] No, I'm Joshua.
SpongeBob: [closes the swimmer's back] Okay, bye. [Patrick is hiding underwater] Marco.
Patrick: [through bubble as it pops] Polo. [pops out of the water]
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
SpongeBob: Marco!
[Patrick swims over to a group of senior citizens.]
Nurse: [blows whistle] Shady Shoals residents, out of the pool!
Old Man #1: I pooped.
Clarabelle: Come along, Mortimer. [blinks her old eyes and pulls Patrick out of the pool]
Patrick: Huh? [notices his wrinkled up body] Oh. Huh? I'm covered in wrinkles.
Clarabelle: Oh, we all are, dear. I call them oldie foldies. [flips her flabby arm] Hurry, Mortimer. Shady Shoals is serving prune ice cream today.
Patrick: Dah! Ice cream, oh, oh! [runs up to the bus, knocking over Clarabelle and an old man] Wait for me! [gets in the bus and it drives away, dragging Clarabelle and the old man in the back]
SpongeBob: Marco! Marco! [touches Marco's face] Marco?
Marco: [grumbles and grabs SpongeBob] Yeah, I'm-a Marco! What do you want?
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't want you. I want Patrick.
Marco: Then stop a-yellin' my name! [drops SpongeBob and leaves]
SpongeBob: Ugh. [softly] Marco.
Larry: [through a megaphone while holding an old man licking a lollipop] Attention, everyone. We found a lost elderly gentleman who goes by the name of Mortimer. Can anyone claim him? [gets no answer and stuffs Mortimer in a lost and found box]
[The bus drives up to Shady Shoals where it is about to drop the senior citizens off.]
Patrick: Come on, let's move it! I want prune ice cream.
Senior Citizens: [gets picked up by Patrick] Ohh.
[Patrick carries the senior citizens into Shady Shoals and flops to the ground. The senior citizens cheer and Patrick pulls himself together.]
Clarabelle: Mortimer, ice cream time.
Patrick: [gets up] Ahh! [pants as he runs to the table, pushes everyone aside and eats the prune ice cream; he belches out the three bowls then starts to feel pain in his head] Brain freeze!
[Patrick's head opens and his brain is covered in ice and snow. Patrick passes out unconscious on the floor.]
Nurse: Clear! [zaps Patrick with the defibrillator] Clear! [zaps Patrick's brain with the defibrillator, but his brain ignites fire; she whimpers and backs away]
[Patrick's brain is burnt to a crisp and the smoke wakes Patrick up.]
Patrick: Oh. [gets up] Ah. [picks up his brain, squirts it with ketchup and eats it] Brain food.
[The scene changes to Patrick knitting a blanket with Mary and Clarabelle.]
Clarabelle: Eh?
Mary: Ehh?
Patrick: [his face is on the blanket] Eh. [rips his face off with the blanket] Oh. [laughs with Mary and Clarabelle]
[The scene changes with Patrick, who is getting old and wrinklier at that time, playing shuffleboard with some old men. He gets a turn, but his arm falls off. He and the two old men share a laugh. The scene changes to Patrick watching an old lady on the verge of dying in her bed. The heart monitor stops beeping and Patrick becomes sad. He puts the blanket over the old lady's head.]
Old lady #1: Gotcha! [she and Patrick laugh]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking in a dark alley with his eyes closed and still playing Marco Polo.]
SpongeBob: Marco!
[Marco grumbles and climbs down the fire escape.]
SpongeBob: Marco!
Marco: You! What I tell youse about-a yellin' my name?
SpongeBob: Ahh! I-I don't remember. Um, sometimes it helps me to remember if I go into a trance. [rubs his head and shows his brain, then a white farmhouse] I'm seeing a small farmhouse painted white. Does that have any significance to you?
Marco: My parents had a white farmhouse.
SpongeBob: What's this? A baby has been born. A boy. There is much happiness.
Marco: That's-a me. I was-a born there.
SpongeBob: They are about to name the boy...
Marco: Marco. They named him Marco. It's Marco. Marco!
SpongeBob: Polo.
Marco: Ahh! [grabs SpongeBob] If I catch anyone a-yellin' my name again, I'm-a gonna hurt them. [throws SpongeBob away]
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! [screams and lands right in front of Shady Shoals where a sleeping Patrick is now old and wrinkly; gets up] Marco.
Patrick: Polo.
SpongeBob: Ah-ha-ha! Found you! Now it's your turn to call Marco.
Patrick: [wakes up] Do I know you, young man?
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me. Remember? ♪Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?♪
Patrick: I don't know. A wizard?
SpongeBob: [pulls up a tub, jumps in and absorbs the water] ♪Absorbent and yellow and porous is he♪ [spits out the water] Ehh.
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob: [plays the final notes with his nose like a flute and laughs] The one and only. Okay, now it's your turn to call Marco Polo.
Patrick: Whoa-oh, I can't do that. I'm all wrinkled now. I do old stuff. [his forehead and eyebrows fall on his face]
SpongeBob: Old stuff? Like what?
Patrick: [lifts up his forehead and eyebrows] Check it out. [shows SpongeBob a rocking chair] This is called doddering. [slowly dodders to the rocking chair] Oh, here's another thing I do now. It's called gumming. [smacks his gums and lips] Neat, huh? [laughs] Now, uh, this part's really fun. It's called complaining. [grabs Joshua] These kids today, they don't know diddly squat!
[Joshua's mother grabs her son and drags him away.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, those are all great things, but wouldn't you rather go jellyfishing? [holds up a jellyfishing net]
Patrick: [imagines a jellyfish and it stings him] Ohh! No, that hurts.
SpongeBob: We could build sandcastles. [holds up a toy shovel]
Patrick: [imagines a sandcastle and someone kicks it in Patrick's neck] It's not structurally sound.
SpongeBob: Well, how 'bout blowing bubbles? [holds up a bottle of bubble with a bubble wand] Nothing bad about a bubble.
Patrick: [imagines a bubble and it floats in front of him] Ooh. [it pops in his face] Are you trying to kill me, son?
SpongeBob: No, I just think we should act our age. [forms a cushion fort and pops out at the bottom] Remember when we used to look forward to rainy days and building cushion forts?
Patrick: These days, I only look forward to my final exit. [goes into a cushion coffin]
Clarabelle: Oh, he was too young. [puts flowers on the cushion coffin]
Patrick: [pops out] No, I wasn't!
Senior Citizens: No, he wasn't. [climbs in the cushion coffin] We are not young.
SpongeBob: Come on, people. Just 'cause you're old doesn't mean you're rotting fish. You're still vital, full of life. Fresh.
Old Man #2: Fresh, you say? Ahh. [his mouth rips off]
[SpongeBob pulls Patrick and the senior citizens out of Shady Shoals as they sit on a rug. He drags them to a nearby coral tree.]
SpongeBob: Okay, you young-at-hearters, today you are gonna climb that tree.
[Patrick and the senior citizens get up and attempt to climb it.]
SpongeBob: [through megaphone] Yes, yes, that's right! Put those flabby arms to use! Laugh at your lumbago! Cackle at your cataracts!
[Patrick and the senior citizens try their best, but couldn't due to being old and frail. One old man falls down from the branch and crumbles to dust. SpongeBob sweeps the old man up and revives him by watering him with a watering can.]
Old Man #3: Is it nap time yet?
SpongeBob: Nope! It's time for the dance party! Everybody on board.
[Patrick and the senior citizens sit on the rug and SpongeBob drags them away. The scene changes to dancing arena where SpongeBob attempts to help Patrick and the senior citizens dance.]
SpongeBob: Are you ready to get down?
Patrick and the senior citizens: Yeah. [get down on the floor and fall asleep]
SpongeBob: No, not like that. Like this! [turns on ragtime music]
[Patrick and the senior citizens stand up and dance to the ragtime music.]
Patrick: Now-now-now-now you're talking.

SpongeBob: Now, let's kick it up a hundred notches! [turns on loud dance music] Yeah!

[The loud dance music causes Patrick and the senior citizens to get heart attacks.]
Patrick: Oh, what's happening?
[Patrick and the senior citizens pass out unconscious to the floor.]
SpongeBob: Oh, clear! [zaps the floor with the defibrillator. reviving Patrick and the senior citizens]
[Patrick and the senior citizens laugh and Patrick zaps his head with the defibrillator. The scene changes to SpongeBob dragging Patrick and the senior citizens across the sidewalk.]
SpongeBob: Isn't it great to get outdoors with the fresh air and sunshine?
Old Lady #2: Stop this rug! Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
Patrick and the senior citizens: Bunny Buns! Bunny Buns!
SpongeBob: Bunny Buns? That's a good idea! Nothing makes people feel young like arcade games, grease, and sugar.
[Inside Bunny Buns, children are riding on kiddie rides, eating pizza, playing arcade games, and swimming in the ball pit. Several kids are watching the animatronic animal stage show. Patrick is whacking the animatronic badger with his cane.]
Patrick: You're coming in too fast on the bridge and you're blowing clams! [whacks the robot's head off and lands on a kid's pizza; the kid cries and Patrick listens through an ear trumpet] Now that's what I call jazz!
SpongeBob: [pushes Patrick away] Ha, ha. So sorry. Let me just take this. [takes the severed robot head and leaves]
[One old man is playing Bunny Bash while using Joshua as the hammer. Joshua's mom grabs her son and drags him away again. An old couple attempts to eat pizza, but they end up pulling their dentures out.]
SpongeBob: I can help you with that. [pull the dentures off the pizza slices and stuffs them back into the old couple's mouths] Eww.
Old Man #1: Hey! [laughs, shakes a soda can and squirts soda at Patrick]
SpongeBob: Old people, behave!
Old Man #1: [gets squirted by Patrick] Whoa! [flies into a skee ball machine and comes out in ticket form] 23 skidoo!
SpongeBob: Oh. [groans as he straightens out the old man]
Patrick: [screams] SpongeBob! [struggles to swim in the ball pit] I'm drowning! [sinks into the ball pit]
SpongeBob: I'm coming, Patrick! [jumps into the ball pit and pulls Patrick out]
[SpongeBob performs CPR and makes him spit out several balls and Joshua. Joshua's mom grabs her son and drags her away again.]
Patrick: Thanks, old-timer.
SpongeBob: Oh, you're welcome. What, who are you calling old-timer? [looks at his reflection on the screen of a video game console and sees himself getting old and wrinkly] Whoa. Where have the years gone? [he and Patrick walk slowly together until he falls flat on the floor] I'm losing steam. [spews out steam from his holes]
Patrick: Wait, hey, man. Don't make a scene in front of all my old friends. [SpongeBob's steam turns Patrick's skin moist and his cane disappears, making him young again] Oh. [looks at his reflection on the screen of a video game console and sees himself young again] Ohh. Now I can't dodder.
[The scene changes back to Shady Shoals and SpongeBob is resting on a rocking chair with a heart monitor next to him. Patrick walks up and puts a blanket onto SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Here you go, old friend. [the heart monitor stops beeping] Huh? [groans in sadness and covers SpongeBob up to his face, thinking he has died]
SpongeBob: [wakes up and feels young again] Gotcha!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: You got me again. [laughs]
[Meanwhile, Clarabelle is playing Marco Polo with several senior citizens near the coral tree.]
Clarabelle: Marco.
Old Man #3: Polo.
Clarabelle: Marco!
Marco: [climbs down the tree] Oh, that's it! I said I was-a gonna clobber the next-a person what-a calls my name!
Clarabelle: No one clobbers Clarabelle! [flexes her flabby arms and her biceps forms into a scooter with rocket boosters on it; then she gives Marco a knuckle sandwich and sends him flying off distance, exploding on impact] Oh, Marco? [takes out an ear trumpet to hear]
Marco: [weakly] Polo.


[chirping]
Squidward: What a sun-tastic day! [slips on Gary's snail trail] Snail trail. [Gary looks through a window as Squidward mops up the trail] That SpongeBob needs to keep his pet out of my yard. I am sick of cleaning up after him.
Gary: Meow. [Squidward discovers Gary leaving trail all over his pet rock collection]
Squidward: Not my pet rock collection. [growls, and starts jumping up and down] That's it! This isn't the first time you've soiled my yard with your revolting excretions. But mark this down in your little notebook: it will be the last time! [Later, Squidward puts up a force field of wood all around his house] This cheap, splintering wood will keep even Gary out. Now, I feel safe. [Gary's trail drops all over him] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: [calmly] Hey, SpongeBob... [screaming] Keep your shelled vermin off of my property! The next time, my annoyingly yellow neighbor, your wet pet oozes on my lawn, you leave me no choice but to call Snail Control. That little monster... [Gary bites Squidward's butt. Squidward stutters] He bit me!
SpongeBob: [pulling Gary away] Gary! No, dirty boy. This isn't like you.
Squidward: Oh, but it's just like you, SpongeBob, to raise such a misbehaved mollusk.
SpongeBob: Gary's not misbehaved!
Gary: [growling]
SpongeBob: But there does appear to be something wrong with him.
Squidward: I'll say. I hope he had his shots.
SpongeBob: Oh, of course.
Squidward: All of his shots?
SpongeBob: Affirmatory.
Squidward: For rabies?
SpongeBob: Yup.
Squidward: Snail pox and soft shell dance?
SpongeBob: Yupie.
Squidward: Bronchitis, lumpy-bump trump, teen angst?
SpongeBob: Yup, yup, yup.
Patrick: [suddenly appearing] Well, let's not forget the worst of them all: Mad Snail Disease.
SpongeBob: Uhh...
Patrick: You mean your pet hasn't been vaccinated for mad snail disease? [to Squidward] Looks like the rash has already started.
Squidward: Rash?
Patrick: Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?
Squidward: [gulps] Well, now that you mention it, my throat is a little dry.
Patrick: This disease will ravage your body with bloodshot eyes, loss of balance... [pushes Squidward]
Squidward: Whoa!
[Gary growls.]
Patrick: Messy pants, [tickles Squidward] ticklish rib cage, [Squidward giggles before Patrick points to his foot] severely untrimmed toenails, and finally, the bite from that infected snail [Squidward freaks out] will turn you into... A zombie.
[Squidward screams, then runs off crying loudly.]
Patrick: [To SpongeBob] You need to get that snail of yours to a doctor before he bites someone important. [both gasp once they see that Gary is missing] There's a mad snail on the loose! [runs off screaming]
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary?! Gary?! Gary?!
Patrick: [runs up to a couple] The mad snail is coming! If he bites you, you'll turn into a zombie.
Fish: Jeepers, what's with all the lunatics? [Gary crawls up]
Fish's Wife: Oh look, honey, isn't he the cutest? [Gary is panting]
Fish: Come here, little buddy. [pets Gary] He's just adorable. [Gary bites him] Mad snail disease is real! I'm a zombie. I've been bitten by a mad snail. I've got mad snail disease!
Fish #2: Then I've got it! A snail just bit me, too! [all screaming]
Frank: [screams; all look at their hands and scream.]
Johnny: We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a news blast. Terror in a shell. This just in... fear and disease are spreading like wildfire as a killer snail has been biting the denizens of Bikini Bottom infecting them with... mad snail disease. [(two scream sound effects are played at once. One of them is from the  "Hooky" episode, the other one was used on the show Rocko's Modern Life.] Ask any old fish on the street and they'll tell you that germs enter through the bite radius, traveling upstream until the entire host body is full of... mad snail disease. [the same sound effect from above can be heard] We now take you to Action News Reporter Perch Perkins live on the scene.
Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here with the first victim of this epidemic. Tell me Mr Tentacles, when did you first begin to suspect that you were a zombie?
Squidward: Well, after I was bitten by a mad snail, I began to get a rash; followed by loss of balance, ticklish rib cage, and a few other symptoms.
Frank: [wearing red shirt] Hey, I was bitten by a snail. I kinda feel off balance. [falls over] Whoa.
Perch Perkins: Hey, I have a ticklish rib cage, too. And I haven't even been bitten.
Frank: [wearing red shirt] Oh no, it's spreading through the air! [all scream]
Perch Perkins: Well, you heard it here first. We're all doomed to a horrible demise. Thanks to a diseased snail. [screams and runs around in circles; TV static then back on; still screaming]
SpongeBob: [shocked due to the news; people screaming] Gary? [horn honking] I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction.
Squidward: [moaning] I'm a zombie... here to dine on your squishy yellow flesh! [moaning like a zombie. Some of the people moan and are zombies. SpongeBob screaming and takes a bus; SpongeBob still screaming and running to the Krusty Krab] It's locked! [all moaning] Somebody let me in.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come in, boy. And bring your friends in, too. They look hungry. [uses key to open]
Frank: Stop! You can't let anyone in!
Mr. Krabs: But they just want to dine on some Krabby Patties.
Frank: They're zombies. They only want to dine on our flesh.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, alright, but it's coming out of your paycheck.
Frank: I don't work here.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?
SpongeBob: Could a voracious flesh-eater do this? [he uses his body to slide through the door]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, it's you.
SpongeBob: That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, that's SpongeBob all right.
Patrick: Or is it?
SpongeBob: Huh?
Patrick: I don't believe that's the real SpongeBob. He looks pretty zombified. Just look at how yellow he is.
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet? [shows picture]
Patrick: Perhaps not, but I got my eye on you!
Old Man Jenkins: If you could pull out your eye and put it on him, wouldn't that make... You a zombie too?
Patrick: You're right. [alarmed] I'm a zombie!
Old Man Jenkins: Who's to say we're not all zombies?! [all scream]
Gary: Meow. [slithers out of the kitchen]
All: The snail!
SpongeBob: Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy.
Harold: No, don't get near it. Oh, the pity of it all!
Evelyn: [to Harold] I can't watch. [faints into Harold's arms]
SpongeBob: All those people think you're a monster. But I know you're just a snail. [screaming after Gary bites him] Gary... [sniffling] How could you?
All: [gasp]
Harold: SpongeBob's been infected by his own pet snail. Oh, the irony! Quick, we must quarantine that infected snail before he bites every last Bikini Bottomite. Let's get the snail!
All: Yeah!
SpongeBob: No! Don't hurt him!
Harold: Hand over the snail!
Mr. Krabs: It's... for his own good, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No! I won't let you touch Gary!
Harold: Stop the madness, man! The Mad Snail Disease ends now! Seize the snail!
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Halt! Did someone say 'Mad Snail Disease'? Is that what all this fuss is about?
Patrick: Yeah. What do you know about it?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Funny you should ask. Allow me to introduce myself. Doctor Gill Gilliam. S.D.E. and S.E.
SpongeBob: S.D.E. and S.E.?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Snail disease expert and snail expert. I'm sorry to break this to you all, but that 'mad snail disease' you're talking about, it doesn't exist.
All: Huh?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: That's right. No such thing. It's an old urban legend. A myth.
Patrick: Well, does that mean we're not zombies?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Of course not. No one is. It's just mass hysteria.
Nathiel: But what about my severely untrimmed...
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Those are only moderately untrimmed. All the supposed symptoms are just common ailments.
SpongeBob: [holding Gary back] Easy, boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?
Doctor Gill Gilliam: Hmmm... mm-hmm. Ahh! The problem's right here. He's got a little splinter in his foot. [The doctor pulls out the splinter and Gary is now back to normal, a zoom out shows that the splinter was one of Squidward's logs, just as an example] I'm sure this was the cause of his distemper making for serious grouchy snailitis.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good ol' Gary's back. [Sandals, Bill, Nathaniel, Charlie, and VB get mad when Squidward comes in and keeps acting like a zombie] Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember?
Squidward: Oh, yes I am. [Nathaniel walks up to order] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
Mr. Krabs: All's well that ends well.
[Gary bites Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Ow! [tries to kill the pain, then looks at Gary]


Mr. Krabs: [turns off lights, lights a cigar, and bathes in money] Ahh, that's the stuff. [sniffs] Hey, something don't smell right. SpongeBob! Hey, what are you burning out here, boy?
SpongeBob: [sniffs] Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive.
Mr. Krabs: Explosive!? [Scene cuts to outside the Krusty Krab where Plankton is flying on a glider laughing evilly]
Plankton: Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene! [activates bomb, which blows up roof]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! I just had that roof redone last week!
Plankton: You will be re-re-doing it when I'm through with you!
Mr. Krabs: Ready ammunition! [SpongeBob takes off his hat and it reveals a pea can. Krabs opens the can with his claw and he pours all the peas into SpongeBob. He then uses SpongeBob as a gun] Fire! [SpongeBob shoots pass at Plankton. The peas shoot through Plankton's air glider. But Plankton blows a bubble over himself causing the peas to be deflected. The deflected peas hit the frying pans. One of the frying pans fall and hits SpongeBob. Plankton then fires a missile at them] Take cover! [Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and uses him as a shield, but the missile just falls straight to the ground] Oh, ha, ha, it didn't go off! Another dud, Plankton.
Plankton: A dud, huh? [He pushed a button which causes the missile to transform into a robotic arm and it squeezes Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob]
Mr Krabs: Oh, you're playing with fire now, Plankton!
Plankton: No need to get worked up with this Krabs, just give me the secret formula and I’ll be on my way.
Mr. Krabs: Well you ain't getting it.
Plankton: I implore you to reconsider. [presses button and arm squeezes harder]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, go jump off a plank.
Plankton: I have ways of getting the information I need. Where’s the formula, Krabs? [tickles Mr. Krabs' posterior with a feather]
Mr. Krabs: Ha ha ha ha!
Plankton: Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs? [He tickles Mr. Krabs' nose with the feather causing him to sneeze and blowing Plankton to the ground] OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal.
SpongeBob: I'll never talk.
Plankton: We’ll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.
SpongeBob: OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!
[Everyone pauses]
Plankton: Clever, behind the painting ay Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Errrrrrrr...
Plankton: [sniffs] Say what am I smelling? You got something burning?
SpongeBob: [sniffs] Smells like blubber to me.
Plankton: Bl bl blubber?
Pearl: Daddy!
Plankton: Ahhhhh! Call off your daughter Krabs! Call her off!
Mr. Krabs: She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.
Plankton: Stay back whale! I'm pippy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries! [As he says this he backs up into the freezer]
Pearl: Did he just go into the freezer?
Plankton: [exits freezer and walks out the door] Don't say it!
Pearl: I prefer salad over Plankton anyway.
Mr. Krabs: Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales? [chuckles evilly] Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my formular, now get us out of this trap.
Pearl: Mall money.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. [gives dollar to Pearl]. Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?
Pearl: Double my mall money!
Mr. Krabs: [grunts] Alright, SpongeBob. It's your turn!
SpongeBob: Here you go, Pearl. Buy something pretty.
Pearl: Hey, this isn't money!
SpongeBob: No, it's even better! This is what Mr. Krabs pays me with. [money is shown] Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!
Mr. Krabs: [to self] Oh, it's all catching up to me... [to Pearl] Please, Pearl? I'll do your homework for ya.
Pearl: No way! The Chum Bucket is, like, totally gross!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm... in that case, Pearl, I'm gonna need to borrow one of your dressers.
SpongeBob &amp; Pearl: Hummina-hunh?/Huh?!
[Cut to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: [runs inside]
Karen: My triumphant husband returns. How'd you fail this time?
Plankton: Krabs had a whale!
Karen: You mean his big, bad, scary teenage daughter?
Plankton: I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?
[Plankton's family is shown being eaten by a whale]
Karen: OK, when you take a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention. It's ripened.
[Bubble transition to Plankton taking out the trash]
Pearl/Krabs: [emerges from dumpster] I'm hungry!
Plankton: [Screams. He runs back inside and bars the door] That should keep her out!
Pearl/Krabs: [sneaks up behind him] I want plankton meat!
Plankton: Holy protozoa! [runs out the lab] Karen, she's here! She got in!
Karen: What are you talking about?
Plankton: There's a whale in the laboratory!
Karen: Are you out of your mind?
Plankton: See for yourself!
Karen: [checks the lab] No whale in here.
Plankton: I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!
Karen: Oh, that's enough, Plankton! If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to more permanent primary functions. [rolls away]
Plankton: Karen! Karen--!
Karen: I'm not listening! [hums]
Narrator: 16 paranoia filled days later...
Karen: [off microphone] Plankton, your dinner is ready. Plankton? Plankton, do you hear me?
Plankton: Yes, I can hear you. Can you bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me. [cries]
Pearl/Krabs: [laughs. Bubble transition to night]
Plankton: [Plankton is shown having a nightmare. He is seen being chased by Pearl and falls into her blowhole] Hey! Get me out of here! [Pearl flings him into her throat with her tongue. He falls into her stomach, where his ancestors find him]
Grand-Dad: Hey, Plankton! Glad you could join the rest of the family!
Plankton: Grand-Dad?
Grand-Dad: Yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid.
Plankton: Gastric acid? [his body is half-burned and he screams]]
Pearl:  [cackles]
Plankton: [wakes up from nightmare and screams] I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy! [cries]
Pearl/Krabs: [takes off disguise and laughs. Bubble transition to morning]
Plankton: [crying] What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale! [lies down] That's it. I'm done. The 4:15 bus should be along any time now.
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?
Plankton: Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.
Plankton: Forget it, kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.
SpongeBob: Okay!
[Cut to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [erases a picture of Plankton] Goodbye, pipsqueak!
SpongeBob: Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.
Mr. Krabs: Really? He's a mess! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?
Mr. Krabs: May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?
SpongeBob: No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this.
[scene cuts to Plankton]
Plankton: [angrily] Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton.
Plankton: What do you got? Mud in your ears? Take a hike!
SpongeBob: Ah, yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: Why should I care? All meaning has left my life ever since I've been plagued by that blasted whale.
SpongeBob: It's okay. Everybody has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is... [whispers in Plankton's ear]
Plankton: Really?
SpongeBob: Mmm-hmm, and guess what else? It was Mr. Krabs in a whale suit that you've been scared of.
Plankton: You mean this entire time it's been Krabs masquerading as a whale!? [angrily] Why that conniving bottom feeder!
SpongeBob: But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such innocuous information, would you?
Plankton: No, of course not.
SpongeBob: Oh, all-righty, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!
Plankton: No, thank you! [laughs evilly. Bubble transition]
Mr. Krabs: This is almost too fun! [puts on costume] Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!
Plankton: Oh, is that so?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes. [breaths deeply] Boo!
Plankton: You don't scare me, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean... [Pearl's voice] I'm Pearl, not Krabs.
Plankton: The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!
Mr. Krabs: Secret fear? [regular voice] What are you talkin' about?
Plankton: See for yourself. [the robotic arm squeezes Mr. Krabs] Enjoy the show! [a mime is shown]
Mr. Krabs: No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!
Plankton: Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, does it scaredy pants? (laughs) I am loving this.
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.
Plankton: Why not?
SpongeBob: Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding. [Plankton gasps. Whales are outside]
Plankton: [scared] Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here! [removes a nail from the floor and jumps inside. SpongeBob puts a cork in the hole, turns off a projector, making the whales disappear, and gets Mr. Krabs out of the robot arm]
Mr. Krabs: Whew! Well, you redeemed yourself, boy.  [to mime] Okay, you really are creeping me out now.


[A sign that says "Fine Antiques For Sale" is put in Mr. Krabs' front yard. Mr. Krabs assembles a rug for the "antiques" to be put in.]
French Narrator: Ah, a yard sale. You know the old saying: "One man's trash is another man's treasure."
Mr. Krabs: [digs in the trash and pulls out a broken razor] Disposable? Phooey. [grabs the trash can and puts all the items in it on his rug for his yard sale]
Narrator: For Mr. Krabs, all trash is treasure. [Mr. Krabs gets another trash can and dumps it on the rug. He sniffs the odor, then uses fresh scent odor spray and sprays it on the pile of trash]
Mr. Krabs: Open for business. [fish walks up] See anything you like?
Fish #1: Yeah, I'll give you a buck-50 for this umbrella. [umbrella has holes in it]
Mr. Krabs: A buck-50 for that? But it's an antique! It belonged to a queen. Ten bucks.
Fish #1: Ten bucks? [opens up the umbrella] It's full of holes!
Mr. Krabs: It was the queen of Switzerland.
Fish #1: A queen you say? That's-- Wait a second! They don't have a queen!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Mr. Bargain Hunter, five bucks.
Fish #1: [hands money to Mr. Krabs] Deal! [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: [smells the money] Ah, the sweet smell of an all-day sucker. [slurping in background]
SpongeBob: They taste even better. [SpongeBob and Patrick are licking lollipops] Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: Whatcha you doing?
Mr. Krabs: I'm having an antique sale. Have a look around.
SpongeBob: [grabs a plunger] Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh?
Patrick: That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the plunger from SpongeBob] That ain't no toilet plunger! This here's an antique! It's, um... uh... [turns the rubber part of the plunger upside-down] ...a 17th-century soup ladle, see?
Patrick: Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?
Mr. Krabs: Five bucks.
Patrick: [gets out his money] I only got seven.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs the money] Deal.
Patrick: Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper. [grabs his lollipop, now stuck on a pair of underwear, and licks it]
SpongeBob: Wow! Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever.
Mr. Krabs: That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: This hat says, "Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking." This hat was made for you, boy. [puts it on SpongeBob] You were born to wear this hat.
SpongeBob: Ee-hee, ooh...!
Mr. Krabs: A perfect fit, eh, son?
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together! [sighs. His eyes fill up with joyful tears] How can I ever repay you?
Mr. Krabs: With 10 dollars.
SpongeBob: [reaches into his pocket and takes out some money] All I have is 5.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I guess it's no deal.
SpongeBob: I'll be right back. [zips home to get change out of the couch, in his shoe, and in his piggy bank then runs back to Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say?
Mr. Krabs: Well-- I don't know... uh, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [he and Patrick walk off]
Mr. Krabs: Don't mention it, boys. [chuckles] What a couple of rubes.
Fish #2: Excuse me, sir, but are you the purveyor of this curio stand?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, I am.
Fish #2: I understand you're selling this rare novelty drink hat. [holds up a picture of the hat that SpongeBob just bought]
Mr. Krabs: Fresh out.
Fish #2: Let me explain. [takes out some money] I'm prepared to give you $500 for that drink hat.
Mr. Krabs: [drools] Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-...
Fish #3: Not so fast. [elbows the other fish out of the way] I'll give you $1000 for such a hat. [Mr. Krabs is stammering and drooling]
Nat: I'll give you $100,000, in cash, for said hat. [Mr. Krabs is drooling up a river]
Fred: [in a row boat] Sir? I'll give you a million dollars for that hat! [row boat drifts off]
Mr. Krabs: [runs off to find the hat, leaving a trail of drool behind] SpongeBob! [Cut to SpongeBob blowing bubbles with his new hat, in front of his house. Mr. Krabs is hiding behind a rock] There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth.
SpongeBob: Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, never mind that. Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl.
SpongeBob: Am I a pretty girl?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful. [mail fish looks at Mr. Krabs with his eyebrow raising] Uh... heh-heh. [SpongeBob laughs] All right, now give me the hat back.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through. [Thought bubble of earlier. SpongeBob gets the hat and sits down a few feet away from the curio stand] Thanks, Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up.
Mr. Krabs: Aw, forget it! And you're not beautiful, either.
SpongeBob: I'm not? [Cut to later where SpongeBob is still blowing bubbles when Mr. Krabs shows up with a bag of hats]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Just the man I wanted to see. Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Mr. Krabs: Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh.
Mr. Krabs: Not even a teensy-tiny bit?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag.
SpongeBob: What is it?
Mr. Krabs: Novelty hats. [takes out a hat with a fan on top of it] How about this air-condition one? [turns it on and blows air really hard in SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Seems a little dangerous. [Mr. Krabs takes out a hat with a mixer on it]
Mr. Krabs: The juicer. [puts in a carrot and the juicer spits out carrot juice]
SpongeBob: Ooh... [Mr. Krabs takes out a hat with the words 'FOXY GRANDPA' on it]
Mr. Krabs: Foxy Grandpa? [SpongeBob laughs] So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?
SpongeBob: No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though.
Mr. Krabs: I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure. I didn't want to have to do this, but he leaves me no other option. [close-up on his mouth] I'm gonna have to scare it off of him. [Cut to nighttime. SpongeBob is snoring. Outside, Mr. Krabs runs up to his window with a fishing pole and a notepad. He draws a ghost on a page]  Heh-heh-heh! This'll scare 'im. [tears the page out of the pad, attaches it to the pole's hook, and throws the line into SpongeBob's window. He gives off a "haunting" moan]
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list! [piece of paper is on the opposite side, with the words "MILK EGGS CHEESE" written on it. SpongeBob screams]
Mr. Krabs: I'm not a shopping list... [turns paper around to show ghost] I'm a ghost!
SpongeBob: [screams]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs evilly] Now, listen, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: How do you know my name?! Who are you?!
Mr. Krabs: I am the ghost of soda drink hats. [hangs down another piece of paper with the soda drinking hat that SpongeBob has] I'm here to tell you that that soda drinking hat you possess is cursed.
SpongeBob: Cursed?
Mr. Krabs: Yes. It once belonged to some guy who's dead now.
SpongeBob: What guy?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... Smitty something.
SpongeBob: Smitty what?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... Smitty Werben... Jaegerman... Jensen.
SpongeBob: He must've been number one.
Mr. Krabs: Number one in Boogeyland! Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately.
SpongeBob: Immediately?
Mr. Krabs: Immediately...
SpongeBob: To its owner?
Mr. Krabs: Yes...
SpongeBob: Right now?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes! It must be returned to its owner, right now.
SpongeBob: [walks up behind Mr. Krabs, covered in dirt and holding a shovel] Hey, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] What?! There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!
SpongeBob: Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery.
Mr. Krabs: How did? I just... You did... I would... Gimme that shovel. [walks off to the cemetery]
SpongeBob: It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1! [Cut to Floater's Cemetery where eerie moaning is heard. A clam on a tree branch hoots like an owl]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Ducks as a bunch of clams are flying over him. Then a black snail growls at him] Ahh! [The black snail slithers away] Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones. [gate squeaks open] Ah! [hides behind a tombstone on a hill] What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here? [Sees Squidward crying as he walks up to a tombstone, puts flowers on it, then leaves. Mr. Krabs walks up to the tombstone Squidward was looking at and reads it] "Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams." What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster. [looks at the names on the different tombstones] Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh. No. No. Uh-uh. No. Not there. [Cut to later] I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue. [thought bubble of SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets. [thought bubble of SpongeBob disappears]
Mr. Krabs: No, not that! [second thought bubble of SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess! [second thought bubble of SpongeBob disappears]
Mr. Krabs: [repeatedly] No, no, no, no, no! [third thought bubble of SpongeBob appears]
SpongeBob: It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on-
Mr. Krabs: [punches thought bubble away] Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find-- [he sees the tombstone and it shows his real name, Smitty Werben Man Jensen] The grave! Am I really going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am! [digs and hits something] Jackpot! [opens up the coffin] Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa. [takes head off with the hat on] Hey, come on, Smitty, let go! [takes his head off] Rest in pieces, Smitty. [jumps out of the hole] I got the million dollar hat. [lightning and thunder booms. Smitty stands up from his grave with his head in one hand]
Smitty: Hey, man, that's my hat. Give it back.
Mr. Krabs: What? No way. Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy. Go ahead, play dead.
Smitty: I guess I'm gonna have to take it from you.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, right. You and what army?
Smitty: [eerie moaning] Only the army of the living dead. [all the other dead bodies are walking towards Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards.
Smitty: That's disgusting! We just want the hat back.
Mr. Krabs: No flipping way! [takes the head of a swordfish and uses it as a sword] Back off! Back off, I say.
Smitty: Attack. [the zombies ready their weapons]
Mr. Krabs: Tallyho! [sword fights a few zombies] Look at me, I'm Errol Fin! [chops up more bodies] You're falling apart, marrow brain. You must be kidding. [sword fights them] Back to oblivion. [jumps over a group of zombies] Oh, ho. How's your sister? All right, boneheads, playtime's over. Yee-hoo, ha-ha! [twirls around and destroys more of the zombies in the morning Mr. Krabs finishes destroying all the skeleton zombies and runs out of the cemetery] Wa-ha! A million dollars. I've got a million dollars! [runs back to his curio stand where the fish are talking altogether at once] Oh, there you are. Well, I got it. The rare novelty soda drinking hat. Let's start the bidding at one million dollars. [all of the fish laugh]
Fred: Yeah, you want that all at once?
Fish #3: One million dollars. You gotta be kidding!
Nat: Hey! The poor sap's not kidding. Didn't you hear? They found a whole warehouse full of them. They're worthless. [Bunch of soda drinking hats are in the dumpster. The fish crack up laughing. SpongeBob walks by with a hat with clapping hands on the top of it]
SpongeBob: Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand. [laughs]
Nat: Now that's worth a million dollars. [SpongeBob laughs again and he leaves the background. Nat runs after him and the other fish follow] Hey, kid, wait up!
Fish #2: I saw him first!
Fish #3: I'll give you one billion dollars!
[Fred rows his row-boat along the ground to chase SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's a spirit breaker. [throws the soda drinking hat away and breaks down sobbing]
Squidward: [walks by with flowers in hand] What a baby. [walks off]


SpongeBob: Ta-daaa! [SpongeBob's house dances around] I did it! I did it! I did it! I did- [slips on something and makes silly noises] [smashes into the door and when it opens SpongeBob falls out and makes a funny noise]
Gary: [slithers toward SpongeBob] Meow.
SpongeBob: [circles around Gary] I learned a magic trick!
Gary: [gets scared and hides in his shell] Meow? [his eyes come out of his shell]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, but I've been trying to learn this trick since I was a SpongeBoy. [gasps as Gary meows] I gotta show Patrick! [starts running toward Patrick's house and hits Norton]
Norton: [spits out mail]
SpongeBob: [finishes running toward Patrick's house and knocks on his rock] Patrick, come on, I got to show you something! [slides into Patrick's rock and makes a silly noise. He then lifts up Patrick's rock.] Patrick? He's not home. [Patrick's rock falls on him and he makes a grunt-like noise] Oh! Squidward! [Squidward goes into his trash can and slides it into his house and pretends like he's not home] Squidward! Squidward, Squidward, Squidward? Squidward? Squidward, Squidward, Squidward?
Squidward: If he thinks I'm out, he'll go away. [SpongeBob continues to say "Squidward" and his eye goes through Squidward's door.]
SpongeBob: [talks through his eye] Squidward! I'm so glad you're home. Got a magic trick to show ya!
Squidward: I hate magic.
SpongeBob: How could anyone hate magic? It's... [close-up of his face] ...magical.
Squidward: [sighs] Okay, show me the trick.
SpongeBob: [gasps in joy as Squidward runs away] Pick a card- oh. [Squidward runs out of his house, closes the door, and swallows the key. Squidward hums] Watch closely, Squidward. The hand is quicker than the eye.
Squidward: [groans and swallows his eyes] Can't watch. No eyes. Sorry.
SpongeBob: [groans and drops his cards] I want to show my trick to somebody. [cries and runs away while Squidward laughs and bumps into his front door]
Mrs. Puff: [scene changes to Mrs. Puff having a student with braces take a drivers test] You're the best driving student I've ever had, Rodger. Kudos. [Rodger laughs]
SpongeBob: [as he's running to Mrs. Puff] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: [scared] Rodger, we have to move now! Punch it! [as the boat is driving, she accidentally hits a fire hydrant] I think we lost him. [SpongeBob arrives with the cards in his hand. Mrs. Puff makes a small scream]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, you got to see my magic trick! [Mrs. Puff and Rodger scream and the boat crashes onto a rock. Rodger's braces break, while SpongeBob stands up with his cards] Pick a card, any card!
Mrs. Puff: Hold on, SpongeBob, I have a trick to show you first. [Mrs. Puff puffs and she floats into the air] Sorry, Rodger, we'll pick this up next week!
SpongeBob: [hanging onto Mrs. Puff] Wait, Mrs. Puff, you didn't see my trick!
Mrs. Puff: [frowns] Okay, show me the trick already.
SpongeBob: [gets off Mrs. Puff and shows his cards] Pick a card, any card! [SpongeBob falls down and slams onto Sandy's treedome. He slides down the treedome happily until he reaches the floor] Sandy! [goes inside the treedome and puts on his water helmet] Sandy, I gotta show you this. [he shows his cards] Pick a card, any card! [SpongeBob screams and drops all his cards as Sandy, who is watering her grass, is missing her head] Sandy? [SpongeBob touches the helmet and it falls off. SpongeBob looks to see where the head is] Where's your head?
Sandy: Oh, sorry, SpongeBob, didn't mean to spook ya. My head's in another dimension, observing. [cuts to Sandy in the Swamp, observing one of the trees. In the background, Bubble Bass and Patrick are on a log, trying to escape a group of alligators on their hovercraft]
SpongeBob: [leaving] Uh-huh, okay, I'll come back later when you have a head.
Sandy: It should be back by Thursday. Friday at the latest. [she starts watering her grass again]
Mr. Krabs: [SpongeBob runs to Mr. Krabs' house and rings the bell] Who is it? [opens his door]
SpongeBob: [shows his cards] Pick a card, any card! [Mr. Krabs gets frightened]
Mr. Krabs: [he smashes SpongeBob's head, making him bounce up and down and make music like an accordion] Magic, eh, boyo? [he leans his eyes toward him] Is this by any chance a trick where you produce money coins from behind people's ears? [as he's winking twice] Wink wink, hmm?
SpongeBob: [crouches down a little] No.
Mr. Krabs: Then what's the point? [closes his door angrily]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gets upset] Ah! [goes to Fred's home and rings his doorbell, which is a miniature leg]] Hi, Fred! [shows his cards] I've got a magic trick that's going to dazzle you!
Fred: [looks with interest] Ooh! Are you going to saw my leg in half, or make it disappear, or pull a rabbit out of it?
SpongeBob: [loses his smile] Uh, no, this isn't going to involve your leg.
Fred: [quickly looks at his watch] Ooh, gotta go, SpongeBob. I'm washing my thighs tonight. [goes inside and closes the door, only to accidentally cut his leg because of the door, while SpongeBob is surprised] My leg!
SpongeBob: [sighs as he walks into a kelp forest] Why won't anyone watch my trick?! [falls onto the ground while the word "trick" flies into the air, causing the leaves on the kelp trees to fall down onto SpongeBob] [SpongeBob gets up, covered with leaves. He slightly pulls his kelp mustache, and then sees two pieces of wood and a rock. A lightbulb appears on top of SpongeBob] Hey, that gives me an idea! [scene cuts to SpongeBob putting the final touches on his rock people] There. Good evening, folks, I am the Great Spongedini! Now watch closely, [reveals his cards] the hand is quicker than the eye. Pick a card. Any card. [SpongeBob inhales all the magic playing cards into his mouth, and then starts his magic trick.]
[The magic trick starts when the kelp forest turns into a white screen as SpongeBob turns into magic playing cards, which then transform into a buzzsaw and cuts a copy of SpongeBob in-half, and then a rainbow appears. Then ten cut in half/rainbow-colored SpongeBobs, two green, two yellow, two pink, two red, and two blue, each holding one magic playing card start running out as the rainbow disappears. Then, two other SpongeBobs, one on the bottom of the screen, and the other on top of the screen being upside down, start leading a bunch of card people from the top, and the bottom of the screen. Then, two other card people start going over and under each other five times, becoming SpongeBob, and back to a playing card. Then the camera zooms out to see lots of card people on the screen, which then fades to SpongeBob. wearing a magician's outfit, a magic hat on top of his head, and a magic wand for a nose, which automatically makes some flowers come out of it, The Great Spongedini then takes the magic wand out of his nose and turns it into three metal rings, that are linked to each other. Then, The Great Spongedini puts himself through the rings, and then, the rings transform into a cannon that shoots out three colorful fireworks. One pink, one yellow, and one blue. Then, The Great Spongedini appears on the screen again, and then notices a red ribbon stuck through his left sleeve.]
The Great Spongedini: Huh? [The Great Spongedini pull the ribbon out of his left sleeve, but then reveals a red, blue, pink, green, and orange ribbon that covers the whole screen. Then the scene becomes spirally and gets put into a magic hat. Then, the white screen turns back to the kelp forest and SpongeBob pulls himself out of the magic hat in a pink bunny suit, ending his magic trick.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! [notices that the audience he made was fake and didn't respond to his magic trick.] Oh... I still wish Patrick was here to see it. [then he notices Patrick sitting on a mushroom, hanging onto another mushroom.]
Patrick: [off-screen] I saw it, SpongeBob! [on-screen] It was astonishable! [Patrick falls of the mushroom and falls flat onto the ground, and pulls himself off the ground.]
SpongeBob: [hugging Patrick] Oh, Patrick! You showed up just in time. What was your favorite part?
Patrick: Uh... My favorite part was... uh..."Ta-da!". I missed everything before that.
SpongeBob: Oh, then you haven't seen seen anything yet! [he grabs ahold of Patrick's hand. The two spin around and then they disappear into a magic hat. Some confetti and a card come out of the hat as the two laugh. Fireworks also start coming out of the hat, while the rock creatures stand inanimate.]


[We see Squidward's house at sunrise. A clam crows like a rooster, causing everyone to wake up. Squidward is sleeping and hears noises. He awakens, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick under his blanket with a sign that reads "happy birthday"]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Surprise! Happy birthday, Squidward! [all three standing in front of a cake] Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday cake! [standing in front of a picture of a seahorse and Squidward has the tail] Happy happy birthday! Pin the tail on the seahorse! [surrounded by presents] Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday, Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick run out of Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Yeah! So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Patrick: Another year older. [laughs]
Squidward: It's not my birthday! [shuts door and takes off party hat] That's it! I'm moving out of this neighborhood!
Realtor Lady: [looking at a picture of Squidward's house] Absolutely, Mr. Tentacles! [showing the Realtor lady as Patty Rechid from Bikini Realty on phone] I can sell your home in a heartbeat.
Squidward: Oh, that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.
Patty: No problem! As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.
Squidward: Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say "neighbors?"
Patty: Of course! I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.
Squidward: Neighbors. Uhh...
Patty: Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then! [both hang up]
Squidward: SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite... [night turns to day then rooster crows everyone up. SpongeBob is sleeping, but is awakened from Squidward's instrument playing outside]
SpongeBob: Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum? [Squidward stops playing]
Squidward: Drum? What drum? [puts the drum on the ground and punches a hole in it] This is just my wig case! See? [puts on the wig, kicks the drum out of the way and frolics around] Come on, SpongeBob, tackle me!
SpongeBob: Squidward! You need bed rest! [pushes Squidward to his house as Squidward is blowing bubbles] I'll keep you safe until you're well again.
Squidward: Oh, I get it. You don't know what day it is, do you?
SpongeBob: Uhh, Wednesday?
Squidward: Why, it's Opposite Day! [SpongeBob is confused] You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!
SpongeBob: Does everybody know about Opposite Day?
Squidward: Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?
SpongeBob: Oh, a game.
Squidward: Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?
SpongeBob: Quiet and out of the way! Yay!
Squidward: Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it.
SpongeBob: I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day. [giggles as he runs back into his pineapple] I'm not ready!
Squidward: So long, chum. [takes off wig] And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: [running to Gary] Gary! It's Opposite Day and I... [stops running] ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day. [crawls into bed] Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary?
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Gary, where’s your holiday spirit?
Gary: [barks like a dog]
SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Company! I hate company. ‘’[SpongeBob rushes to the door]’’Who's there?
Patrick: It's Patrick!
SpongeBob: Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again! [giggles, but Patrick cries]
Patrick: [sobbing] SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!
SpongeBob: [opens door] That's right! You're my worst enemy! [Patrick falls to the ground, bawling] Patrick, you're not really not my friend. It's just Opposite Day!
Patrick: Opposite Day? Hey, I've heard of that!
SpongeBob: You have?
Patrick: No! What is it?
SpongeBob: Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite.
Patrick: Oh! Let me try! Let me try! [Patrick holds his breath and turns purple]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick, breathe! [He takes a deep breath in and pants] Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the wrong way!
[SpongeBob and Patrick dance across the screen as SpongeBob is pink and Patrick is yellow. Gary eats properly from a table]
SpongeBob:  [eats from Gary's bowl] Meow.
Patrick: [sitting on newspapers] Meow.
[SpongeBob and Patrick both blow a bubble, but they blow themselves into bubbles, instead. Patrick pops]
SpongeBob: Kcirtap yeh. [forwards: Hey Patrick.]
Patrick: Pu evig i. [forwards: I give up.]
SpongeBob: Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot! [forwards: To get to the opposite side.]
[Both laugh in reverse. Cut back to house]
SpongeBob: Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?
Patrick: Nope. [He smiles, both laugh]
Squidward: Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob! [packing his belongings into boxes] I'm almost sorry I'm leaving! [laughs] Opposite Day. [hears noises from outside] SpongeBob, what are you... [screams as he sees both SpongeBob and Patrick destroying SpongeBob's pineapple]
SpongeBob: Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day... [giggles] ...terrible? [laughs]
Squidward: I'll tell you what's terrible! Living next to you! You're the worst neighbor in history!
SpongeBob: Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me! [Squidward facepalms]
Squidward: [panicked] If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house! [SpongeBob and Patrick look at the destroyed pineapple]
Patrick: Isn't it beautiful?
SpongeBob: On Opposite Day it is. [Squidward drives up with a bulldozer]
Squidward: Out of the way, SpongeBob! [Squidward pushes the items on the ground with the bulldozer and begins to rebuild the pineapple]
SpongeBob: I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, [he wraps his arms around himself repeatedly] but that really means he's messing it up. [Patrick is drooling] But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means, [Gary meows] Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob! [SpongeBob wrapped his arms around himself] A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being... [stretches his nose out and puts his belt around the middle of his head to resemble Squidward's head and talks like Squidward] Squidward!
Patrick: Hey! I wanna be opposite, too! [SpongeBob thinks, then snaps his fingers. He takes a piece of coral and puts it below Patrick's eyes where his nose would be] Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo! [dances] I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite... [talking like Squidward] ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better. [normal voice again] Now you try.
Patrick: Okay. [takes a deep breath and continues dancing] I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward. [SpongeBob dances along with Patrick]
SpongeBob and Patrick: I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
SpongeBob: [opens door for Patrick] After you, Mr. Squidward.
Patrick: Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward. [walks in]
SpongeBob: You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward. [walks in and shuts the door]
Squidward: [still rebuilding SpongeBob's pineapple] Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be "Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!" [as he is building, Patty Rechid drives up]
Patty: Oh my! The house is even more beautiful in person! [walks up to the front door, knocks on the door. SpongeBob opens it] Hello, Mr... [looks down] Uh... Mr. Tentacles?
SpongeBob: [talking like Squidward] Yes, please come in.
Patty: It's funny, I pictured you being much taller.
SpongeBob: Yeah, everyone says that.
Patty: Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house.
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Positive things! Opposite Day... [talking like Squidward] I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.
Patty: Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.
SpongeBob: Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard! [Patty looks at him, shocked] Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?
Patty: Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...
SpongeBob: Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer. [laughs then stops] Please follow me. [both walk into Squidward's art room] And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.
Patty: [looks at painting of Squidward] Oh my, this painting is very nice. [Patrick bursts through the painting]
Patrick: Thank you! [Patty screams and leaps up to the ceiling, hanging onto a beam]
Patty: Who's that?!
SpongeBob: I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.
Patty: You're both Squidward?
SpongeBob: I'm Squidward, he's Squidward.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're both Squidward.
Squidward: Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet. [sees Patty's boat and screams] NO! [SpongeBob plays Squidward's clarinet badly for Patty]
Patty: Okay, I really don't want to hear another one.
SpongeBob: Okay. [plays more]
Patty: I really don't want to hear more, thank you.
SpongeBob: I hear you loud and clear. [plays more]
Squidward: [bursts in] Stop! Get away from her! Oh, oh, I am so sorry, ma'am, I hope these two [turns to them] barnacle heads [turns back to Patty] haven't harmed you in any way.
Patty: Who are you?
Squidward: Why, I'm Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick pop up in the background. Patty's face slowly turns annoyed]
Patty: [angrily cats] What kind of fool do you take me for? [to Patrick] He's Squidward, he's Squidward, you're Squidward... I'm Squidward! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?!
Gary: [with a pickle on his face; imitiating Squidward's voice] Meow.
Patty: [shocked then angry] I'm outta here. [she walks away]
Squidward: Ma'am, please! What about my house?!
Patty: I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on Earth! [walks out of the house]
Squidward: Wait!
SpongeBob: Don't...
Patrick: ...Go!
Squidward: [screams, runs out, and holds onto her leg, dragging him, as she is leaving] No! No! No! No! No!
Patty: Stop! Stop!
Squidward: Please, sell my house!
Patty: Never! [gets in her boat]
Squidward: Don't leave me here! [falls to the ground, crying. Patty drives off]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [happily walk up to Squidward] Happy Opposite Day, Squidward! We hate you! [Squidward seethes with fury, then gets an idea]
Squidward: Let me show you guys how much I... hate you! [Squidward drives up with the bulldozer chasing SpongeBob and Patrick, they both scream and run away]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?!
Squidward: [angry, still chasing them] Happy Opposite Day! [chases them down the street and laughs evilly]


[episode opens to the Krusty Krab and we see Squidward reading a magazine that says Everybody Ablomp Now. He then looks from the magazine and see a bunch of fish on the tables staring at him. Squidward twitches his eyebrows in a suspicious way. One of the customers slowly closes his eyes and opened it back. Squidward jumps by this and another customer falls over and licks the floor. Everyone appears like they're about to have seizures]
Squidward: [whispers with clenched teeth] SpongeBob, why aren't those orders up yet? [Cut to the scene where we see two fishes with forks and knives and they're moaning like zombies. Squidward is stunned by this. Scene cuts to the kitchen. He pokes his head through the window]. SpongeBob, the collective blood sugar around here is dangerously low. [looks down on the grill to see some cards on it] Why are you grilling index cards? [close up to the index cards that talks about boating school]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I got a little distracted. [holding up an index card] I'm practicing for my oral report for Boating School tomorrow.
Squidward: You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. Now get those orders ready!
SpongeBob: Okay! Okay! [takes off his hat and shoves out seven patties from inside it] Hm, what's so scary about public speaking anyway? You just stand in front of the public and speak publicly. It's really no different to what I do everyday.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob coming out of the kitchen with a Krabby Patty and gets shocked. We see a bunch of fish looking like zombies]
SpongeBob: No big deal, SpongeBob, you just stand in front of them... [Cut to the scene where we see the customers moaning and the background changes to swirls] ...front of them looking... [SpongeBob backs away slowly to the kitchen] ...at me [closes the kitchen door. He peaks through the window and sees the customers] ...with their eyes! [He shrieks and ducks] Squidward is right! Public speaking is frightening!
Squidward: [grabs the Krabby Patty from SpongeBob] Must I do everything myself? [looks to his left] Huh? Stay back! You'll get your patty when it's your turn. [Squidward gets pulled back, all customers begin to physically fight for the Krabby Patty, results Squidward getting beaten up. SpongeBob stretches his legs up and peaks over at the window. He looks at the fight and ducks as a barrel crashes in his direction. SpongeBob pulls back steadily]
SpongeBob: I never knew an audience can get so physical. [Squidward screams and is thrown to the back and is continuously mauled by the zombified customers] This changes everything. [He slowly creeps away as Squidward still gets beaten up.. Scene bubbles over to Patrick's Rock and Patrick goes over to it and opens it. We see SpongeBob on the rock]
Patrick: Oh, sorry, wrong rock. [Patrick turns to leave but SpongeBob stretches his arms to grab Patrick and takes him under the rock.. Scene cuts to the inside of Patrick's home where we see that SpongeBob made it look exactly like the inside of Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I wonder if you'd help me by lending me your eyes.
Patrick: Okay. [starts pulling at his eyes] Uhhh...
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, you can keep them. I just want you to watch me while I practice my speech up here. [referring to the little platform he made out of sand] Just pretend you're a student at his desk.
Patrick: Okay. [goes over to one of the desks made of sand and sits on it]
SpongeBob: [Gets on the little platform and holds up an index card]
Patrick: H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class. [He moves the sand desk a little farther, stops, then moves up a little]
SpongeBob: Okay, here goes. [reads] Boating safety is...
Patrick: SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass?
SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick. Just sit tight and let me practice.
Patrick: Fine.
SpongeBob: [clears throat] Boating safe...
Patrick: Boring! Next!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're kinda derailing the proceedings here. Just focus on me, huh?
Patrick: All right, all right. [looks closely toward SpongeBob. Cut to a close-up of Patrick's face and he blinks his eyes]
SpongeBob: So, without further ado... [He sees that Patrick has fallen asleep] Patrick? [taps Patrick's forehead] Patrick, wake up. [Patrick slowly wakes up] What happened, Patrick?
Patrick: Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Do you think that's too much to expect?
Patrick: Yes! And you should be prepared for worse.
SpongeBob: Worse?
Patrick: You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. You gotta be ready. Now try again.
SpongeBob: Okay. [stands on the small platform] Boating safety... [A pillow is thrown at his face] Boating safe... [More pillows are thrown at SpongeBob and we see that Patrick is the one that's throwing the pillows-fed up with his oral speaking, wants him to either stop or present more better and interesting]
Patrick: That's it! [grunts] Fight through! [SpongeBob is buried in a pile of pillows, but he rises up from the pile panting]
SpongeBob: Patrick, nobody throws pillows in class!
Patrick: Says you! Speech!
SpongeBob: Boating safe...
[Patrick walks up to him dressed up like Mrs. Puff]
Patrick: [imitating Mrs. Puff] SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom.
SpongeBob: Uh, you sorta add a hand in that, too, Patrick.
Patrick: [imitating Mrs. Puff] Young man, how dare you?! [He writes into a small notebook, tears a paper out, and hands it to SpongeBob, which is a detention slip]
SpongeBob: What, a detention slip?
Patrick: [imitating Mrs. Puff] I'm not hearing your oral report.
SpongeBob: Okay. [reads] Boating safe... [A treadmill is place under him and he's running on it]
Patrick: Try again.
SpongeBob: [panting] Boating safety... [Patrick bangs on cymbals causing SpongeBob to lose his balance and hang on the handles]
Patrick: Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do?
SpongeBob: Patrick, somehow I don't think this is working. [As he is saying this his body starts to shred into a pile of yellow dust with his arms on top of it due to his body being on the treadmill]
Patrick: [shouts] Speech! [SpongeBob turns to normal and yells] Speech! Speech! Speech! [SpongeBob gets nervous] Speech! Speech! Speech! [SpongeBob shivers. Now Patrick's eyes are talking] Speech! Speech! Speech! [Now SpongeBob is more nervous] Speech! Speech! Spee -
SpongeBob: Patrick, stop! Somehow your help just isn't helping. I am more nervous about this oral report than I've ever been about anything. [shudders]
Patrick: Yeah, you do look pretty terrible.
SpongeBob: Well, if I don't do my report, then I don't pass. And if I don't pass, then I don't get my boating license! [starts crying]
Patrick: Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws. [holds up his hands that look exactly like a squirrel's] Maybe she can make you a fake one.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's illegal, but she might be able to help me get over this anxiety. She's always speaking at science conferences. She's probably full of pointers!
Patrick: Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya. [SpongeBob looks surprised at what Patrick says. Scene bubbles over to Sandy who is examining SpongeBob with her magnifying glass]
Sandy: Hmm... White knuckles, leaky pores, and stomach in knots. Y-y-yep. He does look pretty bad. SpongeBob, you're afflicted with severe oral report-itis. You know, patients with this disease have been known to physically explode. Ker-pow!
SpongeBob: [shudders]
Sandy: It has been scientifically proven that [pulls a paper down with a person on it] 85% of speech related stress can be eliminated if the speaker imagines the audience in their underwear.
[SpongeBob's hand take the clothes off the person and he covers his underwear. He tears the page to cover his underwear]
Sandy: Everyone will look so silly, you won't even remember you're nervous! Which is why I invented these. [shows an underwear with goggles stuck to it] Goggles that let you see people in your undies. Or, I could just make you a fake boating license.
SpongeBob: That's still illegal. Give me the goggles! [puts on the goggles but nothing's happening] It's not working.
Sandy: Well, of course it isn't, silly! I'm only wearing my undies. See if it works on Patrick.
SpongeBob: [turns to Patrick. He jumps at this] Eh! Ooh, they work.
[Scene bubbles over to Mrs. Puff's Boating School]
Billy: ...and they were never heard from again.
Mrs. Puff: Thank you, Billy. That was an excellent report. Next we have-- [crosses off Billy, then sees SpongeBob] --SpongeBob SquarePants. Ugh.
Patrick: [zooms over to SpongeBob] Go on, buddy.
SpongeBob: [gives Patrick a thumbs up. He gets out of his seat and goes to the front of the room. He clears his throat and then freezes. Cut to the other side of the class. Cut to SpongeBob. He gulps]
Mrs. Puff: Well, SpongeBob? Do you have your oral report ready?
SpongeBob: [in a small voice] Huh...?
Mrs. Puff: The assignment I gave you. The one where you talk in front of the class.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! Of course I'm ready! [starts sweating] I can do it. [Shubie checks her watch] Um... [Scene goes across the room. In another scene, the background is yellow. It also shows angry people and Patrick about to throw a pillow at him] Oh, no. Oh, no!
Mrs. Puff: What are you doing?!
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, do I really have to do this?
Mrs. Puff: No. Only if you want to pass this class!
SpongeBob: Okay. [walks to the front of the room] Uh, my report...is on... [his pinky starts to vibrate. He holds it] Heh! Must be last-minute jitters! [starts to vibrate too. He goes all around the front of the room and stops where he was before] Patrick, where are those goggles?
Patrick: Right here. Let me polish them up for ya. [rubs his arm on the lens and it breaks] Here ya go.
SpongeBob: Thanks! [puts them on]
Billy: Hurry up! [in his underwear]
SpongeBob: [gasps; sees other people are in their underwear, too] Ha, ha, it's working! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ...
Mrs. Puff: What's all this laughing about? [is wearing a bra and underwear] Well, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [laughs] "Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the ocean because -- [his broken lens start to function weird. Billy's underwear now has a scary face on it]
Scary Face: Well, don't just stand there! Get on with it!
SpongeBob: [screams as he sees the other underwear with scary faces on them] They're all staring! [throws the hat on the floor and runs out the door]
Patrick: Hey, where are you going? You forgot your goggles! SpongeBob, wait! [SpongeBob drives a boat] SpongeBob!
Mrs. Puff: You can't take my boat! SpongeBob!
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob!
Mrs. Puff: Get back here with my boat!
Police Officer: I don't know, slow day at the office, huh?
Police Officer #2: You said it, partner! My baton's itching for the noggin of a lawbreaker.
SpongeBob: [screams as he runs a stop sign]
Police Officer: Okay, forget what I just said. [Police Officer #1 and #2 chase after him]
Police Officer: Sponge, pull over!
SpongeBob: I don't know how!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob breaks through three houses, smashes into the next one and goes flying and lands on his head]
Police Officer: All right, kid, what was that all about?
Police Officer #2: Don't you know anything about boating safety?
SpongeBob: [he looks surprised] Boating safety? Well, yes, Officer. I do. [he gets back on his feet] Boating safety is the responsibility of every boater in the whole ocean. Each boater must follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the boater safety handbook. When the meaning of all important signs... ...pay attention to all surroundings... ...when wet means no parking... ...it already figures... ...always blah blah blah... ...with all shades of curve... ...remember... ...a motor vehicle is 20,000 pounds of blah blah--
Police Officer #2: Gee, kid. [wipes a tear from his eye] That was beautiful.
Police Officer: Yeah. I never even knew some of those things myself.
Mrs. Puff: Aha! Finally! The long arm of the laws caught up with you! I guess I won't be seeing you in my driver's education class for the next 5 to 10 years! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Police Officer: Wait, wait, Miss Chuckles, did you say you were his boating instructor?
Mrs. Puff:  [getting nervous] Yes. Why?
Police Officer: Under penal code 26-1 quote, "The boating instructor is responsible--"
SpongeBob: --"for any minor delinquent actions under that teacher's care".
Police Officer: Unquote. I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in, ma'am. [handcuffs Mr. Puff and puts her in the police car]
Mrs. Puff: What?! Nooo!
Patrick: Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of getting an oral talking thing.
SpongeBob: Hey, I did! Thanks, pal!
Patrick: Oh, that reminds me. [shows the hat] You forgot these. [puts them on] Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work! Heh! [the scary face appears]
Scary Face: And, what are you lookin' at?
Patrick: [screams and runs away]


[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab where Squidward is selling his paintings.]
Squidward: Ladies and gentlemen, behold my wondrous paintings!
[The customers ignore him and continue eating their foods. Squidward moans and gets really angry.]
Nat: Um, excuse me, can I have some ketchup?
Squidward: Hey, look at my arts you dummy!
[Nat falls over, splattering patties all over SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: [wipes the patties off his face] I don't know how you talked me into this art show, SpongeBob, but I'm shutting this thing down right now! [wipes the patties off SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Aw, you can't, Mr. Krabs. Wait until Squidward sells some of his paintings.
Squidward: Buy some important paintings. See me expose my exquisite suffering.
[The customers continue to ignore Squidward and continue eating their foods.]
Squidward: Hmph! These fools don't even recognize the masterworks in front of their faces. I'll confront them with the power of my art!
[Squidward runs up to a customer with a painting of himself with a shirt on.]
Squidward: Witness the beauty!
[The customer spits his food onto the painting.]
Larry: Come on, Larry! Get your salad on!
Squidward: Come on, Larry! Get your art on! [holds up a painting of his muscular self with a sea bear]
Larry: [his eyes flare up] Oh! My eyes! Ahh! [pulls his burning eyes out and his innards flare up as well] The pain! [runs away]
[Squidward backs away slowly.]
Orchid's son: I want a Krabby Meal!
Squidward: [baby talk] How about some art to go with that? [holds up a painting of two Squidwards riding each other on the beach]
Orchid's son: Ahh!
Orchid: [screams] Run, baby, run!
[Orchid and her son run out of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: That's it! Squidward is scaring me customers away! I'm shuttin' this art show down! He's never gonna sell his paintings!
SpongeBob: Sure he will! [holds up a painting] I just bought one.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Holy shrimp! Why would you do that to yourself?
SpongeBob: What do you mean? I love it.
[SpongeBob holds the painting in front of a customer, but the customer's head burns up and his body crawls to the floor.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Squidward is our friend and his paintings are so cheap, you should buy one just to be nice.
Customer: [coughs] I'm good.
Mr. Krabs: Nice? Nice? I don't waste my money on nice!
SpongeBob: But think about how valuable these paintings might become.
Mr. Krabs: Valuable? What do you mean?
SpongeBob: When art gets older, [his face becomes old] it usually gets more expensive. [his face becomes money] Squidward's paintings might be worth millions someday.
Mr. Krabs: Millions?! [his tongue makes a dollar sign and he pushes SpongeBob] Out of me way! Here! [throws coins at Squidward and takes the paintings] Gimme! [grabs the painting he missed] Give it here! This is mine now!
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Now, all I need to do is sit back and watch me art grow more valuable. [his eyes turn into coins as he laughs]
Art Appraiser: I am a very important art appraiser and I say this so-called art will never be worth a penny.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Eugene H. Krabs does not—[freaks out and gasps] I'll lose money! There must be something I can do to make this art worth lots more cash!
Art Appraiser: [lowers his glasses] Hmm...
Squidward: I sold all my art? This tiny handful of coins has legitimized me! [puts on his beret] Who wants the autograph of a real artiste?
[Squidward paints his signature on a tough guy's forehead, which angers him. The tough guy throws Squidward out the door.]
Art Appraiser: Well, paintings can become much more valuable when the artist is no longer with us. You know. Out of the picture. [pretends to hang himself]
Mr. Krabs: Out of the picture, eh? I think I can arrange this.
[Squidward walks back in the restaurant.]
Squidward: Artist walking. Check me out.
Mr. Krabs: Check this out. [holds out a delivery bag] I have a delivery for ya, Mr. Squidward.
Squidward: What? You can't be serious. An artist such as myself should not be subject to such menial tasks.
SpongeBob: Aw, don't be menial to Squidward, Mr. Krabs. I'll take the delivery.
Mr. Krabs: No, Mr. Squidward is a real artist now and real artists can handle anything.
[The scene changes to Squidward walking through the arctic tundra with the delivery bag.]
Squidward: The arctic is so cold! [shivers and the wind blows upon Squidward] Come on, Squidward. You're a strong artist. You can do it! [the wind blows him off] No!
[Squidward is blown off the cliff and falls into the snow next to a snowman who looks like SpongeBob.]
Squidward: [shivers and looks at the snowman] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [sneaks up behind Squidward] Oh, hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Just getting some ice. [holds up a large cube of ice] Fresh. [stuffs the ice inside his mouth and laughs] Need some help? [falls in Squidward's hole] Whoa!
[SpongeBob lifts Squidward out of the hole as the SpongeBob-snowman comes to life. SpongeBob and Squidward walk over to an arctic sperm whale.]
Squidward: Here's your food.
[The arctic sperm whale takes the delivery bag and pulls out a Krabby Patty frozen in ice. Then he takes a bite of the frozen patty.]
Arctic Sperm Whale: Hey, this is cold! Perfect!
[SpongeBob and the arctic sperm whale laugh. The whale slaps Squidward and he breaks into pieces.]
SpongeBob: Eeh, we'd better get you home.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs on the phone in his office.]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, is this the art appraiser? Just wanted to let you know that me good, good friend, Squidward, is now "out of the pict—" [sees SpongeBob and Squidward walk in] Wh—wh—wh—What the seahorse?! [runs up with another delivery bag] Got another delivery for you, Squidward! [points to SpongeBob] And only Squidward!
SpongeBob: Your eyes are so pretty.
[Mr. Krabs giggles. The scene changes to Squidward going to Rock Bottom on a bus.]
Bus Driver: Next [raspberry] stop, [raspberry] Rock [raspberry] Bottom! [raspberry]
[Squidward exits the bus and two very creepy fish swim past him.]
Squidward: [reads bag] "237 Rock Bottom." Oh, there it is! Oh, remember, Squidward, real artists embrace the unknown. [goes down the ladder] Uh, is anyone here? [raspberry] I've got a delivery from the Krusty [raspberry] Krab!
[Creepy fish come up and blow raspberries at Squidward.]
Squidward: Ahh!
SpongeBob: [screams as he appears next to Squidward] What are we screaming about?
Squidward: Monsters!
SpongeBob: Oh, they're not monsters, Squidward. They're my friends.
Angler Fish: What's [raspberry] up, [raspberry] SpongeBob? Ha. [raspberry]
[The angler fish and gang put on party hats and dance as they blow raspberries. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs erasing Squidward's picture on the paper.]
Mr. Krabs: [on the phone] Yes, I'm sure that Mr. Squidward is out of the picture for good. He will be missed. So, come on over and tell old Krabs how much money me paintings are worth. [hangs up the phone and laughs]
[SpongeBob and Squidward appear with party hats, laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha, ha, he-he, ha. [sobbing and growls] Squidward, delivery! [gives him another delivery bag]
[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob and ties him to a chair.]
SpongeBob: Ha, this tickles. [giggles]
Mr. Krabs: Follow me, Mr. Squidward. I've got a special delivery vehicle just for a great artist like yourself.
Squidward: Well, that's more like it. Finally, some respect.
Mr. Krabs: Into the rocket ya go!
[Mr. Krabs pushes Squidward into the rocket ship and Squidward gets strapped into the seat.]
Squidward: Wait! Why do I need a rocket? Where is this delivery to?
Mr. Krabs: Mars. [closes door]
Squidward: Oh, Mars. Well, the...M—M—M—M—M—Mars?!
SpongeBob: Bye, Squidward!
[Mr. Krabs launches the rocket and it blasts off into space. The rocket flies Squidward all the way to the planet, Mars. Squidward walks towards three martians-like creatures and hands them the delivery bag.]
Squidward: Delivery from the Krusty Krab.
[The martian takes the bag and pulls out the Krabby Patty. Then the martian eats the patty.]
Martian: Mmm! Yummy, yummy! [gibberish]
[The martians hover together and eat the delivery Squidward gave them.]
Squidward: Hmph. All this red. So garish. Ha, this dump needs a true artist touch.
Martians: Huh?
[The martian roars and swallows Squidward whole. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab back on Earth.]
Mr. Krabs: So, now that Squidward definitely 100% is gone for good, what a shame, what do you think of these here paintings?
Art Appraiser: Well, of course they're awful, but if the so-called artist is really out of the picture, then perhaps they're worth something.
Mr. Krabs: Really? [sobs] Oh, it's so complicated. These are tears of joy, but they're also tears of sadness for my good friend, Squidward. Wherever he is.
SpongeBob: Oh, here he is, Mr. Krabs!
[Squidward appears in a UFO outside the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rushes outside.]
Mr. Krabs: Stay here and keep an eye on me investments. [runs outside]
[The UFO drops Squidward off and flies away, leaving him covered in slime. Squidward is paralyzed at the events on Mars, but recovers quickly.]
Squidward: [wipes the slime off and puts his beret back on] Well, that was disgusting. So, who wants to talk about my use of color and brush stroke?
[Mr. Krabs growls.]
Art Appraiser: Ahem! [rips the $150,000 tag] Hmph!
Mr. Krabs: I have done everything I could to get you away from here safely and now you're messing with me money!
[Mr. Krabs pulls out a mallet and Squidward runs away, screaming.]
SpongeBob: Run, Squidward, run!
Mr. Krabs: Hey! How about a little support here?
SpongeBob: Run, Mr. Krabs, run!
[Mr. Krabs runs off after Squidward, screaming.]
SpongeBob: But a little slower than Squidward.
French Narrator: 3 hours later...
[Squidward is still being chased around by Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs is using a human nose mask to track down Squidward. SpongeBob appears hiding behind some rocks, grabs Squidward and covers his mouth.]
SpongeBob: Psst, it's your best friend, SpongeBob.
[Mr. Krabs continues to sniff around.]
Squidward: Oh, get off of me!
SpongeBob: I'll never get off of you, Squidward. Not until you're safe.
Squidward: I'll never be safe! [pushes SpongeBob off] Not until my paintings are gone!
SpongeBob: No, Squidward! You can't deprive the world of your paintings!
Squidward: True, but it's better than depriving the world of me!
[Mr. Krabs finds Squidward and SpongeBob behind the rocks and goes to hit them with his mallet. Mr. Krabs chases Squidward and SpongeBob to the Krusty Krab in a fast pace.]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward! Destroy those paintings before Mr. Krabs gets back!
[Squidward pulls out a power saw and hesitantly goes to destroy the paintings. However, he doesn't have the guts to do it.]
Squidward: I...I can't do it! They're just too magnificent!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, hey! Get away from me paintings!
Squidward: Oh, I'm sorry, paintings, but it's you or me!
[Squidward destroys several paintings with his power saw.]
Art Appraiser: Yes, yes! Now, this is true art!
Squidward: What? Really?
Art Appraiser: So visceral! So dangerous!
Squidward: Yes, feel my art! [destroys some paintings with his power saw]
Mr. Krabs: [crashes through the doors] Leave me paintings alone, you monster!
Art Appraiser: No! That was the most accelerating performance art I have ever seen!
Mr. Krabs: Really? So, it must be worth millions! Hey, out of me way!
[Mr. Krabs proceeds in helping Squidward destroy all of the paintings. Then they go to destroy the office and some tables.]
SpongeBob: [chuckles nervously] Mr. Krabs, uh, Squidward, I—I don't think you should be doing that.
Squidward: Oh, don't be so provincial, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, stop trying to censor our money! I mean our art!
[Mr. Krabs and Squidward continue to destroy everything in the Krusty Krab. They destroy the menu, the clock, and the cashier boat. They even destroy the table of a paid customer, who was about to eat his lunch.]
Art Appraiser: [gasps] Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
[Mr. Krabs and Squidward continue to destroy the Krusty Krab until it is nothing but shambles. They exhaustedly walk up to SpongeBob and the art appraiser.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoo, boy! Hee, hee! So, how much ya gonna give me for all this? Ha, ha.
Art Appraiser: Nothing! Performance art is about the moment. You cannot put a price on it. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: What? Wait, come back here, you double-crossin'—
[A piece of the roof falls on top of Squidward and Mr. Krabs, crushing them.]
SpongeBob: D'oh! Mr. Krabs! Squidward!
[SpongeBob lifts the roof piece up.]
Art Appraiser: Ah-ha!
[The scene changes to the art appraiser giving a tour around the art museum.]
Art Appraiser: And that is how I acquired this masterpiece.
[The masterpiece turns out to be a completely flattened Mr. Krabs and Squidward who are stuck on the fallen roof piece. The tourists chatter in wonder.]
Squidward: I'm an artist.
Mr. Krabs: I'm rich.
SpongeBob: And I helped. [laughs]


Narrator: Welcome to SpongeBob's House Party, with your host, Patchy the Pirate. There'll be punch, cookies, explosions, and a brand-new episode of SpongeBob SquarePants!
Old-time crowd: Hooray!
Narrator: Now live, from Encino, California, get ready for a warm embrace from our party host, Patchy the Pirate!
Patchy: Hey, get off my lawn! Party? [takes a party sign off his door] There ain't no party here. Go away!
Potty: Bawk, come on in!
Patchy: Hush, Potty, can't you see I'm trying to keep out the riffraff?
Potty: Riffraff? That's our television audience, barnacle breath!
Patchy: Oh, of course it is! I was just fooling! Welcome! [gasps] Say, you didn't bring SpongeBob with you, did you? Gee, I sure hope he got his invitation.
[the scene fades to SpongeBob and Patrick receiving their invitations]
SpongeBob: I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation!
Patrick: Me neither.
SpongeBob: Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire. [he and Patrick throw their invitations in a camp fire and warm their hands]
Patchy: Ah, well, come on in. Let me introduce you around. This here's Minnie Mermaid. She's cooling off on account of she's been dancing her scales off, isn't that right, Minnie, huh, takin' a little breakie poo?
Minnie: No, Patchy. Actually, I'm in here because if I wasn't, I would die.
Patchy: Ha, ha! That's the spirit! [Patchy strikes his hook into Minnie's pool, causing water to spurt out. Minnie nervously tries to stop the leak]
Patchy: Huh, let's see, who else haven't you met? That's Longbeard the pirate. Hey, there Longbeard, long time no see!
Neptune: Who dares to interrupt Neptune?
Patchy: Sorry about that, Neppy. That's Neptune. [unenthusiastically] He's king of the sea. [to two guests] You kids having fun? [Kids are chuckling] He-he.. whew! Hosting a party is hard work alright. That reminds me of a time when SpongeBob was hosting a party. Hey, you kids want to see that cartoon? [camera moves up and down] You do? Well then, launch the cartoon!
[episode starts]
Narrator: Ah, the Barg'n-Mart. A consumer's paradise of brand-like items, stocked as far as the eye can see. [SpongeBob is running down the aisles trying to get to the check-out counter as soon as possible]
SpongeBob: Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou!
Lou:  Uh, that's great, SpongeBob. $1.42. 
SpongeBob: But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records. [writes the record down in a book] 19 seconds.
Lou: Okay, so it's a $1.42.
SpongeBob: Sign here please. [Lou signs at the places that SpongeBob points] Initial here, and here, and here, and here. [SpongeBob notices a picture of Lou from a while back] Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here! [picture shows a happy Lou] Look at you, so young and happy! [puts the picture down and we see a sad Lou] Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? "Plan Your Own Party Kit"? Hey Lou, how much?
Lou: For the Plan Your Own Party kit? Oh, we're having a special on those. Uh, they're free. But you have to leave...[scowls] right now.
[scene cuts to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Let's see Gary, according to the "Plan Your Own Party Kit," invitations are the first order of business.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [reads first thing on list] "A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success." Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends.
Fred's dad: [reads invitation] Who the barnacle is SpongeBob SquarePants? [Mable peeks from around the corner]
Mable: I believe you went to kindergarten with him, dear.
Fred's dad: Kindergarten, huh? [Dad shows a picture of SpongeBob and his Kindergarten class] Oh yeah, SquarePants. Well, I guess it's time to move again.
SpongeBob: Boy, Gary, this "Plan Your Own Party Kit" is a real life-saver. [mixing ingredients and reading a cook book] How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream. [takes a little taste] Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta' this world! [timer goes off] My piñata! [takes out the piñata from the oven and he squeals; he tosses it around] Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. [he puts it on the table] The "Plan Your Own Party Kit" suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs. [puts eggs in the piñata]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good question Gary, but not to worry. The "Plan Your Own Party Kit" warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule! [takes out list] 8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution. [list rolls across the table] At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades. [list rolls along the wall] 9:38: charity apple-bob. [list is still rolling around] 9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice. [winks at Gary. The list stops on SpongeBob's head] At 10:09, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success. This is gonna be the coolest party ever! [puts a party hat on Gary's shell. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Ha, ha! Looks like it's smooth party sailing for SpongeBob so far. Now it's time for me to get my own party underway! Gather around, ye scurvy landlubbers, it's time to learn the peg legged dance o' happiness. [lays out a dance mat] Oh, it's quite simple really, all you need is a peg leg and some patience. And my instructional video series, only $29.95.
Potty: Bawk! How tacky. [flies off]
Patchy: It's a $40 value, Potty! [yelling] A $40 value! Now, it's very easy and loads of fun.
Salt Water Sam: Hey, everybody, the band's here.
[party guests cheer off-screen]
Patchy: Band? What band?
Potty: Bawk, the band I hired for the party. [Patchy was laughing]
Patchy: A jolly idea, Potty. A little live musical get me shindig dug. Who'd you get? [a picture of every group is shown as Patchy says their name] Barnacle Bill and the Seven Seas?
Potty: No.
Patchy: Seaweed Sally and her Cackling Turtle?
Potty: No.
Patchy: Oh, oh, I know: The First Mates.
Potty: No.
Patchy: Saltwater Sam, featuring the Brine Brothers.
Potty: No.
Patchy: Uh, Rusty Hinges and the Boys from the Brig?
Potty: They broke up years ago.
Patchy: Well, who else is there?
Potty: The Bird Brains!
Patchy: Oh.. [laughs, but then chuckles in confusion]
Potty: The Bird Brains--They're better than all those other bands.
Patchy: But they're just a bunch of birds.
Lead Singer: Hello, Encino! [The Bird Brains begin playing heavy metal music]
Patchy: Potty, that's the worst sea shanty I've ever heard! I certainly hope it doesn't get any louder. Ohh! [A blast of heavy metal rock music sends a screaming Patchy flying backwards out of the house, blasting him through six more houses before slamming face-first into a metal telephone pole. Back at the party, the band continues to play; Patchy enters his house while covered with debris] No, no, No! Stop the music! [yells as he runs to the band and the music stops] Stop! Look, boys, I know that you fellas sound good around the birdbath, but this here is basic cable! This is the big time! I'm afraid it's time for you to walk the plank.
Lead Singer: You mean we're fired?
Patchy: No. [Patchy and the band go to the plank.] Go on, start jumping, or you'll be dealing with the business end of me sword! [waves his sword at them, laughing. The birds just fly away] No! I forgot that you're birds! Ahh! [breaks down sobbing, whacking himself on the head with the sword]
Narrator: [screen: PLEASE STAND BY] While Patchy pulls himself together, let's see how SpongeBob's party is shaping up. [shows SpongeBob's house decorated]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come! [looks at his watch] Don't worry too much, Gary, it's only ten seconds past 8:00. [gasps] Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations. 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed! [cries] No one's coming. I'm the worst host ever! [doorbell rings] Oh, the first guest, and only forty seconds late. [opens door to see Patrick]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Welcome, Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?
Patrick: Sure? [SpongeBob runs over and pours a glass]
SpongeBob: Did you have any trouble finding the place? [gives Patrick the glass] Here you are!
Patrick: Thanks. [drinks some punch]
SpongeBob: So, the punch okay?
Patrick: Not bad, not bad.
SpongeBob: Hmm, nice weather we're having.
Patrick: It's been very mild, yes.
SpongeBob: Yep, it's mild season. [nervously laughs] Ahem. So, you read any... [doorbell rings] Oh, more party guests! [Mr. Krabs has walked in with a purple coat on] Welcome, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch.
Mr. Krabs: Don't mind if I do! [drops his coat on Gary. Gary sticks his eyes out of the sleeves]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [looks over his party list] Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot... [hands Patrick and Mr. Krabs name tags] These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions. [doorbell rings] Oh, more guests! [Patrick tries to read his name tag upside down]
Patrick: Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.
Mr. Krabs: No, you dumb bunny, it says, "Hello, my name is Patrick."
Patrick: [shakes Mr Krabs' hand] Nice to meet you Patrick.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Good one, Patrick! [both laugh]
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick. [doorbell rings]
Patrick: Was he talking to me or you? [SpongeBob opens door to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you made it!
Squidward: My cable's out.
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that. [SpongeBob hides some wire cutters behind his back]
Mr Krabs: So, uh, how's it going, Squidward?
Squidward: Not bad.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob clears his throat, attracting Mr. Krabs and Squidward's attention] I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47. [erases something on his clipboard and clicks his tongue] But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter. [SpongeBob takes Scooter and places him near Squidward] Here are some topic cards to break the ice. [hands them some cards. The doorbell rings] Oh, someone's at the door!
Scooter: Mine says, 'What came first?: the oyster or the pearl?' You take the side of the pearl!
Squidward: This is lame. [Squidward throws away his card and walks away]
Sadie: My card says, "Discuss the philosophical nature of irony." What does yours say?
Patrick: "Nod politely." [shown Mr. Krabs and Plankton with cards]
Mr. Krabs: What does yours say, Plankton?
Plankton: Oh, uh, it says, [really shows "Where are You From?"] 'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.' [clears throat] How interesting.
Mr. Krabs: Nice try, Plankton. [everyone is chattering amongst themselves. The doorbell rings]
SpongeBob: [he is looking angrily at his watch and tapping his foot and the doorbell rings] Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive... [looks at his watch] 22 minutes late! [opens up the door to Tom Smith]
Tom: Hey, hey! [SpongeBob folds his arms in a sort of anger. Tom laughs nervously holding a bag of chips as SpongeBob walks into the party]
SpongeBob: Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position! [silence. everyone claps silently] As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me! [laughs as he walks into a room with a sign that reads 'Coat Check', but ducks back out with a serious look] Seriously. [closes door]
Narrator: (television version only) That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages. [fades out and back in] [Patchy is shown dancing and a guy in a submarine outfit walks towards the camera] Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!
SpongeBob: [scene cuts to his wardrobe] Hey, Gare, got another coat for you. [throws the coat on Gary] The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to [uses air quotes] work. [cackles and walks back out with his clipboard] Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here? [guests are talking and dancing to the music. SpongeBob starts to hyperventilate] This is all wrong! What's happening to my party? [scene cuts to Sandy and Larry dancing] No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm! [scene cuts to Sandals eating cake. SpongeBob takes a vacuum and sucks out all the food from his mouth] Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52! [switches into 'blower.' Slice of cake is blown perfectly back into the rest of the cake. A plate with bacon and eggs is blown onto the table] Hey, what's this?
Sandals: That's my breakfast!
SpongeBob: Could I have everyone's attention please? [Patrick is dancing by the record player] Patrick! [stops the music] If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks. [the guests walk over to the couch] Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means! [gets out a newspaper] Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this! [guests cheer] This is yesterday's paper. [they stop cheering as SpongeBob walks outside] I'll just go grab today's paper. [everyone starts to party when he leaves. talking to himself] SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you? [tries to open the door] Locked out? [knocks on the door. Scene cuts to Patrick and Sandy are dancing]
Sandy: This song's got a great beat.
Patrick: Yeah. Knock, knock.
SpongeBob: Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me? [looks through the window and his eyes bug out as he wails. He sees the party, with all the guests dancing and having fun and the music blasting] Oh no! [cut to the topic cards on the floor and two fish just talking] They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing! [cut to Patrick eating all the deviled eggs in the piñata in one gulp and everyone else cheering him on] Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs! [scene cuts to two guests laughing] Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it. [scene cuts to Patrick and Mrs. Puff talking]
Patrick: So, do you come here often?
Mrs. Puff: No. [phone rings. Patrick answers]
Patrick: Hello, SquarePants residence. What? [covers one ear] I'm sorry, what? [scene cuts to SpongeBob using a pay phone outside, across the street]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!
Patrick: You wanna talk to SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!
Patrick: Okay, hold on. [opens door] SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!
SpongeBob: What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait! [SpongeBob runs toward the door.]
Patrick: Sorry, he's not out there. [Patrick closes it in front of him before he gets inside]
Scooter: Hey, dude, if you're looking for SpongeBob, he's over by the punch bowl.
Patrick: Thanks. [Patrick hands the phone to an ice sculpture of SpongeBob's head] Here you go, SpongeBob. [drops the phone in the punch]
SpongeBob: Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule! [looks up noticing the bathroom window is open. Scene cuts to Larry looking in the window]
Larry: Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat! [the mirror shows a real lobster on a plate] Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind. [looks through the medicine cabinet. He finds a comb with three angles and teeth coming out from them] Hey, check out his crazy comb.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet. [climbs up the side of his house] I hope they don't touch my special comb.
Larry: Well, I think I've aired it up enough. [Larry closes the window on SpongeBob's fingers. SpongeBob falls down screaming. Larry hears the screams] Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands flat on the ground then gets up and looks at his broken fingers] I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events! [scene cuts to inside where Pearl and Mrs Puff talking to each other]
Pearl: Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, yes, everything is quite lovely. [sees SpongeBob spying through the window] Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings. [turns the window around]
SpongeBob: I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in! [takes a shovel and digs. Digs up into the middle of the party] Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned. [guests are hopping around the room. They hop on SpongeBob and send him through the hole he dug] I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but... [now wearing a bunny suit] ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in! [takes a pick-ax to cut the door but a bright light shines at him]
Officer John: Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?
Officer O'Malley: I don't know. It's probably how he gets his kicks.
Officer John: You criminals make me sick.
SpongeBob: I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!
Officer John: [smiles] Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!
Officer O'Malley: You have a nice party now, sir. [both walk off]
SpongeBob: Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.
Officer John: Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?
SpongeBob: [stammer-like] But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.
Officer O'Malley: Whoa, whoa, okay, motor-mouth, tell it to the judge. [handcuffs SpongeBob but the handcuffs are not working] Oh no, these cuffs are broken.
Officer John: Huh, we can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.
[bubble transition to Officers John and O'Malley taking SpongeBob to jail in a pillory]
SpongeBob: Is it too late to offer you some punch?
Officer O'Malley: Sir, you have the right to remain silent. [scene cuts to next day]
SpongeBob: All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit! [tries to open the door] Oh, yeah, the door's locked. [lifts up the welcome mat] Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr! [inserts key and walks in] Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster. [Patrick walks up]
Patrick: That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!
SpongeBob: It was?
Patrick: Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!
SpongeBob: I am?
Patrick: Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya! [walks out]
SpongeBob: [smiles] SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all. [Gary's got a lampshade on his head] Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [turns off the light and Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Oh ho ho, I'm glad to see that old SpongeBob's party worked out. Now I gotta get me own party going! Ready for some real music, Potty?
Potty: [someone places corks in his ears] Bawk! Okay, ready.
Patchy: [starts singing and, while he singing, everybody is simply staring at him] ♪Oh... scurvy ain't for the likes of me, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho... Oh! Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho.. Oh, scurvy ain't for the likes of..♪
Potty: Bawk! It's time for your flute solo.
Patchy: Thank you, Potty, I almost forgot... [Potty gives him the flute and he is about to play it, but Patchy stops] Hey wait a minute. I don't play a flute. I play a fife. [Patchy turns and sees that the "flute" is actually a lit stick of dynamite; He screams in horror] Potty, no! [the dynamite explodes and everybody cheers] Wow, I can't believe I survived that one. [realizes his body is destroyed and he is reduced to only a head; he whimpers] Potty, help me!
Potty: Ladies and Gentlemen, bawk! The Bird Brains!
Bird Brains: ♪Come with me to the land I love, It's not right here, down the street, or up above. It's down below in the deep blue sea. Where SpongeBob lives, and the fun is always free. Down, down, down, to the bottom of the sea. Where our salty friend SpongeBob waits for you and me. [dolphin chirps] Down, down, down, ahh, we'll have lots of fun. You and me forever in the underwater sun. We'll catch some jellyfish if we get a chance, Say hello to Patrick, and do a little dance, Karate chop Sandy, see Squid get a tan, Eat a Krabby Patty and foil Plankton's plan. Down, down, down, to the bottom of the sea. We'll hook up with SpongeBob and his snail Gary. [Gary meows] Down, down, down, ahh, we'll have lots of fun You and me forever in the underwater sun, underwater sun.♪ [everybody cheers]
Patchy: [has a barrel on wheels for a new body and two wooden poles sticking out of it for arms] Aha! Great job, boys! Thanks for stopping by! Don't hit the porthole on the way out. [to the audience] And thank you for stopping by! You've made this party a real fun time. [The doorbell rings]
Potty: Bawk, the ladies are here!
Patchy: Oh! Ladies! Shiver me timbers! Welcome, girlies! [chuckles, but stops because the ladies are female birds and they giggle as they come in and attack him] Huh! No!
Potty: Goodbye, folks!
Patchy: It's Potty you're after!
Narrator: Thank you for coming to SpongeBob's House Party!
Patchy: Belay the smooching. Belay the smooching!


[At the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs checks the register but it's empty.]
Mr. Krabs: Yeesh, we need some customers in here. [Patrick comes in Krusty Krab groaning] What's gotten into you?
Patrick: I don't know. [his stomach turns into different shapes and sizes] What's happening to me?
SpongeBob: I think I can explain. [lifts up Patrick's belly] Yes, I've seen this one before. It's a common symptom. Patrick is suffering from Krabby Patty Withdrawal. He needs one, or he'll keep mumbling about it for the next 3-1/2 minutes.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, he needs one, eh? [to cash register] Methinks a paying customer's in our midst. [to Patrick] Patrick, how's a Krabby Patty with extra cheese sound?
Patrick: [gasps] Give me! [Patrick acting like a dog]
Mr. Krabs: Not yet. First, I have to know, can you pay for it?
Patrick: Oh, yeah, I can pay for it. [Mr. Krabs patting him]
Mr. Krabs: Good boy. [cut to Patrick inhaling a bunch of Krabby Patties like a vacuum]
Narrator: Ten seconds later... [Patrick is full with a mountain of Krabby Patties snoring]
Mr. Krabs: My good man, how you doing? [Patrick mumbles] Excellent. Now, let's get down to business. [gets out his receipt]
Patrick: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: It's your bill.
Patrick: I don't have any money.
Mr. Krabs: What? I thought you said you could pay for it!
Patrick: [referring to how many Krabby Patties he ate] Oh, I'm payin' for it all right. [belches]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Non-paying customer! [alarm blares while the whole place is put on lock down]
Patrick: [looking puzzled] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: [grabbing Patrick by the head] You're gonna pay, one way or another. [cut to Mr. Krabs and Patrick in bathroom] All right, Patrick, if you're not gonna pay for your food with money you're gonna pay with hard, physical labor. I want you to swab the latrine. [looks at the trash and spiders on the floor] I'll be back in a while to check up on you. [mumbles] Bottom-feeding...
Patrick: No problem. Tra-la-la-la-la. [pushes the bucket along the floor leaving puddles of water on the ground] Work, work, work, work.
Mr. Krabs: [coming back in] So, Patrick, how are you...? [gasps] What in blazes did you do?
Patrick: [sitting on the ground with green soap on his belly] I accidentally tried the hand soap. [eats some more and burps] It doesn't taste as good as it smells. [Mr. Krabs mutters while pushing Patrick into the kitchen. Opens up a freezer door]
Mr. Krabs: See these ice cube trays? [points to barrel] I want you to put 'em in that bucket.
Patrick: How do I do that?
Mr. Krabs: Figure it out!
Patrick: Uh... I have to be very gentle. [Patrick does the exact opposite; he closes the doors, picks up the freezer and throws it on the bucket, causing it and the freezer to break into pieces]
Mr. Krabs: What the...? What are you doing?
Patrick: [stacking ice cubes on remains of barrel] Almost done, Mr. Krabs. [stacks on last ice cube, causing pile to collapse]
Mr. Krabs: You've destroyed me refrigerator. [picks up melting ice cubes] You've destroyed many of the things I love. [grabs Patrick by the arm] I got another job that even a nimrod like you couldn't mess up. [cut to in front of the trash chute] All you got to do is throw all of these trash bags down the trash chute, like so. [throws a trash bag down the chute] See?
Patrick: Yup.
Mr. Krabs: Good, 'cause if you mess this up, you'll never eat another Krabby Patty again! [Patrick screams]
Patrick: Hurry, hurry, hurry! [throws some sacks into the trash chute fast]
Mr. Krabs: [to SpongeBob] Here, boy, take this sack of loot and put her in me safe.
SpongeBob: Okie dokie, Mr. Krabs. [goes by the trash room but hears some crashing so he checks it out] Patrick, what's up, buddy?
Patrick: [a bunch of trash bags are stuck] I have to get rid of this trash, but it won't go down. [Patrick cries]
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's because you didn't hit the trash compactor switch. [turns the compactor on. All the trash is gone]
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're a genius! [sees the money bag on SpongeBob's shoulder, mistakenly thinks it's a trash bag] Oh, no, there's one left.
SpongeBob: [Patrick grabs the money bag, desperate] Patrick, that's not a... [Patrick throws the money bag into the compactor] trash bag.
Patrick: [seeing that the compactor won't sucked the money bag] NO! Why won't you go down?! [Patrick frantically starts flipping switch up and down, only causing the compactor to expand]
Mr. Krabs: Well, well, let's see how the poor boy's doing. Well, did you earn me money back yet, Patrick? [The Krusty Krab explodes. The remains of the trash compactor comes down in its original spot and sucked the money bag into the trash compactor and all over Mr. Krabs' face.]
Patrick: [Mr. Krabs looks at him angrily, knowing this was Patrick's fault] Can I eat now?


[The episode begins with a storybook entitled "Patnocchio." The book opens and the screens zooms into the picture of Karen in a beautiful fairy outfit holding her wand. She is seen standing outside of Bikini Bottom at night.]
Karen: Greetings, children of Bikini Bottom. I am Karen the Computer Fairy. [waves her wand and a scallop flies on her hand; she sings real loud, which causes the scallop to shatter into bits] And I have a magic tale to tell. [waves her wand and a picture of Patrick appears on her screen] Once upon a time, there was a dim-witted sea star [Patrick appears in a puppet outfit and looks a lot like the character, Pinocchio] who was about to stuff his fat face. [waves her wand with the word "Magics" fly by; her screen shows the Krusty Krab]
[At the Krusty Krab, Patrick comes out through the doors with a plate full of Krabby Patties. He takes a seat on a table and goes to eat his meal. Little did Patrick know, Plankton was observing him through a magnifying glass about his restaurant.]
Plankton: Hee, hee, hee. That idiot has such a huge pile of patties. I don't think he'll notice if one walks away. [laughs]
[Patrick continues to eat his lunch. Plankton flies into the patties and peaks out.]
Patrick: Aw, I need more ketchup. [hops out of his chair and runs back in for ketchup]
Plankton: Hmm… which patty to choose? This one? Nope. Too small. [throws away small patty] This one? Nope. Been chewed. [throws away chewed patty] This one? Nope. The seeds are missing. Hmm...
[Suddenly, the sun shines bright through Plankton's magnifying glass and burns him. Plankton screams and his body is on fire. Patrick comes out with a ketchup bottle and sits on top of Plankton.]
Plankton: Ow! Stand up, you moron!
[Patrick squeezes the ketchup bottle too hard and ketchup explodes everywhere. The ketchup flies in Patrick's eyes. Patrick panics and knocks over the table and the patties.]
Plankton: Get me an ice pack, you idiot!
Patrick: Where are you, Voice? [stretches his face and his eyes stretch out] Where are you? [sees SpongeBob, who is coming out of the restaurant]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick?
Patrick: [screams and his eyes pull back into his face] Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. I thought you were this crazy voice who keeps telling me what to do.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's probably your conscience.
Patrick: What are conscience? Are they bad?
SpongeBob: No. A conscience is a tiny voice inside you that tells you the difference between something that's right and something [gives Patrick a wedgie] that's wrong.
Patrick: So, I should do what the voice tells me to do?
SpongeBob: [pats Patrick's head] Now that's a smart little sea star. [leaves]
[Patrick giggles and swallows the plate full of patties. Plankton grins and gets an idea. He decides to take advantage of the opportunity by posing himself as Patrick's conscience so he'll get a Krabby Patty and now the formula. Plankton peels himself off of Patrick's butt and runs off. Patrick sips down some soda just as Plankton climbs up his shoulder in conscience disguise, which is the similar clothing to the character, Jiminy Cricket.]
Plankton: Patrick, this is your conscience speaking.
Patrick: Huh? [sees Plankton on his shoulder] Oh. [bows and drops Plankton in his soda] Nice to meet you, Conscience.
Plankton: [comes out of the soda] So stupid. So, Stupid, the first thing you need to do is buy some more Krabby Patties on the double. Hi-yah! Hey-yo!
Patrick: That'll be the first thing I do, Conscience!
Plankton: Yes!
Patrick: Right after I run some errands.
[Patrick pulls out a to-do list from his bellybutton and reads it.]
Plankton: Huh? [flings himself out of the cup] No! [kicks the soda] I'm calling the shots here. Now, get that Krabby Patty!
Patrick: I—I—It's just a little list! Please, Conscience?
Plankton: Alright, Pea-Brain. Make it quick.
Patrick: Number 1: High-five everyone! [waves his arm around with Plankton like he's playing a guitar] Huh!
Plankton: No, put me down first!
Patrick: High-five! [high-fives a civilian with Plankton in his hand] High-five! [high-fives another] Low-five! [low-fives a civilian] High-five! [high-fives SpongeBob] High-five! [high-fives a tough guy] High-five! [high-fives another] High-five! [high-fives another] High-five! [high-fives a realistic hand that punches Plankton]
[Plankton is squished and beaten up by the high-fives each person gave to Patrick. He liquifies into a puddle. Patrick slips on Plankton and falls on his face. Patrick giggles. Karen waves her wand to the next scene. The scene changes to Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat. The kids are in there eating ice cream sundaes and Goober meals. The mascot, Goofy Goober is greeting a little girl with a bowl of ice cream. Patrick and Plankton go up to the counter.]
Patrick: Number 2: Ice cream! Yeah! [waves his arm around with Plankton again and does his victory screech] One double chocolate molar blowout, please.
Goofy Goober waiter: One molar blowout, coming up!
Plankton: No! [pulls Patrick's tongue] You hate ice cream. You only want Krabby Patties. [hops into the soft serve ice cream machine] Hey you! Cancel that order!
[The Goofy Goober waiter pulls down the lever and swirls Plankton into a soft serve ice cream cone. He gives the cone to Patrick. Patrick begins to eat Plankton. Plankton bites Patrick's tongue.]
Patrick: [screams] Ow. You hate high-fives and ice cream? Are you sure you're my conscience? [looks at Plankton]
Plankton: I, uh, I'm absolutely positively your conscience. [his nose grows into Patrick's eye]
Patrick: Hey, doesn't your nose grow when you tell lies in fairy tales?
Plankton: Nope. Noses only grow when you make up the truth. [his nose grows longer] See?
Patrick: Ah-ha-ha! Oh, oh, I wanna make up the truth, too! Uh, I ate a hot air balloon for breakfast. [nothing happens] I—I—I mean, um, I did not eat a hot air balloon for breakfast. [his nose grows longer] Hey! I got a big nose too! Nose fight! En garde! [hits Plankton with his long nose]
[Patrick and Plankton engage a nose sword fight and the kids cheer. Plankton hits Patrick and makes him knock over a table. The triple gooberberry sunrise sundae flies into the Goofy Goober waiter's face. He is covered in ice cream.]
Children: Uh-oh.
Goofy Goober waiter: Hooray!
[The kids, Goofy Goober, and Patrick cheer. Patrick and Plankton resume their nose sword fight. Plankton pokes Patrick's butt with his nose and sends him rolling towards the counter. Patrick crashes into the counter and splatters ice cream all over the place. The Goofy Goober waiter is covered in ice cream and looks like a snowman.]
Children: Uh-oh.
[The ice cream melts off of the Goofy Goober waiter. He looks down and sees Patrick and Plankton.]
Patrick and Plankton: Sorry.
[The Goofy Goober waiter is really angry and his ice cream cone pupils melt in fury. He kicks Patrick and Plankton out, sending them flying into the street. Patrick and Plankton fall on their noses and they break off.]
Plankton: Time to let your conscience be your guide. Give me that list! [goes into Patrick's bellybutton, grabs the list, crosses out everything and writes something down] Here! [gives Patrick the list]
Patrick: Hey, only one errand left! [leans back and forth and plays his air guitar] Gotta give Plankton a Krabby Patty! [fireworks explode above him]
Plankton: [shakes his hat off, waves his blond hair and plays his air guitar] Oh, yeah! Yeah!
[The scene changes to Patrick and Plankton arriving at the Chum Bucket with a Krabby Patty.]
Patrick: I wonder why I wanted to give Plankton a patty?
Plankton: Why not Plankton? He's a sweetheart. [his nose grows long and Plankton clips it off] And as your conscience, I demand you toss that patty in the mail slot!
Patrick: Oh, I love mail slot toss! [attempts to throw the patty in the mail slot, but he misses as it bounces upwards]
Plankton: Not so hard! [slaps Patrick] Huh? [sees the patty land on Pearl's picnic basket who is going to the beach with her friends]
Pearl: I've been wanting to hit the beach all week. [laughs]
Pearl and her friends: Goo Lagoon! Goo Lagoon! [drive away to Goo Lagoon]
Plankton: Huh? [his mouth falls in shock; Plankton forms another idea and a lightbulb lights up above his head. He pastes his mouth back on] Ah-ha! Patrick, please promptly pursue Plankton's patty! [points to lightbulb] Get the idea?
Patrick: Uh, uh. [strains himself as a lightbulb appears on his head; but it burns out and Patrick drolls]
[Plankton groans, grabs a ladder, and climbs up to Patrick's head.]
Plankton: How many plankton does it take to change a lightbulb? [unscrews the burnt lightbulb and replaces it with a new one] One. [climbs down, pulls Patrick's tooth and the lightbulb lights]
Patrick: [wakes up] Huh? Now I get the idea! Whoo! [waves his arm around again] Gotta follow that patty!
[Patrick runs off to follow Pearl and her friends to Goo Lagoon. Plankton is trampled by Patrick's feet and gets up.]
Plankton: Wait for me, you pink pinhead! [gets blown away by the wind]
[The scene changes to Goo Lagoon. Pearl lays by to rest in the sun. Patrick and Plankton arrive by digging under the sand. They tunnel past several beach goers along the way. They hit Tyler's beach umbrella. They hit Fred.]
Fred: Ow! Hey, watch it!
[They hit another beach goer who is sipping a drink. Plankton pops out of the sand and spit some of it out. Patrick pops out of the sand and spits out a volley ball. Pearl nearly sucks her umbrella in her mouth while she sleeps.]
Plankton: There's Blubber Mouth.
[Pearl sucks the umbrella in her mouth and swallow it in her sleep.]
Patrick: There's Plankton's patty!
Plankton: You know what to do.
Patrick: Do I? [gets slapped by Plankton] Oh yeah!
[Patrick digs towards Pearl and goes to grab the patty. The patty falls off the picnic roll into Pearl's mouth. Plankton escapes and falls on the sand. But Pearl has swallowed the patty whole.]
Plankton: [groans] Oh, well. No patty for Plankton. [sobs]
Patrick: Huh! I'm going in! Hi-yah! [jumps into Pearl's mouth and goes down her throat]
Plankton: Ugh. Just being near a whale's mouth gives me the creeps. [gets and pulled into Pearl's mouth by Patrick; Patrick and Plankton fall deep down Pearl's throat and Patrick screams] Quiet, you fool! You'll wake up Pearl.
[Patrick and Plankton land in Pearl's stomach. Pearl feels a bit of painfulness and goes back to sleep. Patrick gets scared and cowers in fear.]
Patrick: This is snug.
Plankton: Mother always said I'd end up in a whale's belly. Or prison.
Geppetto: Hey! Who-a goes-a there?
Patrick: Who goes where?
Geppetto: [comes out from his tent] The name's-a Geppetto. Take off your hats and stay a while.
Plankton: We don't have time for a visit, old man. We're just trying to find a sandwich.
Geppetto: Sandwich? No, I haven't seen anything like that around-a here in months. [his nose grows]
Patrick: Hey, Geppetto, what's that behind your back?
Plankton: Is that our Krabby Patty?
Geppetto: Nope. [his nose grows longer] Oh! [punches his nose back in his face]
Plankton: [jumps on Geppetto's shoulder and grabs the patty] Ah-ha! I got the patty!
Patrick: [grabs Geppetto's wig] Ah-ha! I got the wig! [puts it on his head]
Geppetto: [goes in his tent] Son, they're-a stealing our food!
[Geppetto pulls out an unfinished wooden puppet he calls Pinocchio.]
Pinocchio: Who's stealing our food, Pop? Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!
[Patrick and Plankton look at each other in puzzlement.]
Geppetto: Get 'em, Pinocchio!
[Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio get into a brawl. Geppetto ties Plankton and Patrick in puppet strings. They brawl again and they all get tangled up in puppet strings. They brawl again and they all play jump rope like children. They stop and resume their brawl. Their fighting causes Pearl to get a horrible taste of indigestion and her stomach growls in pain.]
Pearl: Oh, no. A stomach ache at the beach? That's no fun! I wish it would go away.
[Karen magically appears next to Pearl.]
Karen: Your wish is granted. Hold out your hand! [waves her wand and poof up a bottle of Gush and Flush stomach reliever]
Pearl: Wow! What is this?
Karen: For fast relief of indigestion, try Gush and Flush. And wash your pain down the drain. [whispers] And my stupid husband, while you're at it.
Pearl: [drinks the stomach reliever] Ah.
[Pearl's stomach growls. Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio continue to fight until they get caught in a torrent of stomach reliever. Pearl blasts the stomach reliever out from her blowhole, sending Patrick, Plankton, Geppetto, and Pinocchio out of her body.]
Pearl: Thank you, Extra Strength Gush and Flush! [giggles and winks]
Geppetto: Pinocchio, we're-a free-a! Free-a!
[Pinocchio waves his arm around while Geppetto sings his heart out. Suddenly, a giant clam comes out and swallows them both.]
Plankton: Huh? [gets up] Don't worry about the patty, Patrick. I'll take it to Plankton myself, like a good little conscience. [picks up the patty] See ya!
[Plankton goes to return to the Chum Bucket with the patty, but bumps into a small yellow starfish who turns out to be Patrick's real conscience.]
Patrick's conscience: Oh, uh, hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Eh, my conscience?
Plankton: Your wha?
Patrick's conscience: Yep, I'm Patrick's conscience. But I overslept.
Patrick: Well, if you're my conscience conscience, then who's that?
Patrick's conscience: It's a bug! Step on it!
[Patrick rapidly steps on Plankton with his foot.]
Karen: And they all lived happily ever after. So, until next time, this is—
Plankton: Karen!
Karen: The Computer Fairy hoping all your dreams come true.
[Karen waves her wand and her screen goes back to the storybook. The last page says "All Your Dreams Come True" on it. The scene zooms in Karen's screen to go to the storybook.]
Pinocchio: [appears on screen] Let me at 'em, Pop! Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em! Let me—
[The book closes onto Pinocchio and the cover says the title, "The End" on it.]
Pinocchio: Ow.


[the episode starts at SpongeBob's House]
SpongeBob: [hands Gary a bowl of food. Gary takes a bite of the food and SpongeBob puts on his Krusty Krab hat. He then opens the door and sees Patrick, whimpering, and he jumps onto SpongeBob's couch] What's the matter, buddy? You seem so sad.
Patrick: [angrily] Oh yeah, well uh, you know what's sad? This. [points to and touches SpongeBob's hat]
SpongeBob: My hat is sad?
Patrick: No! You have a special hat, which means you get to go to your special-happy-worky place. While I just stay... [turns around and whimpers some more] bored all day. I want a special-happy-worky place, too! [cries]
SpongeBob: First thing's first, Patrick. What do you like to do?
Patrick: Uhhh... [drools; zooms into Patrick's head and shows an oval image of an tidal wave with a large breeze passing by blowing sand] Sand.
SpongeBob: Oof! [SpongeBob turns around and slaps his head] Ooh, I gotta run. I have patties to flip, [runs to the door] but I sure hope you figure your problem out. Think about it. [closes the door]
Patrick: Think about it. Think, Patrick, think. Hmmmmm... hmmpphh! [Patrick's head swells up like a balloon and pops.] Thinking is painful. [swings his deflated head over to look like a ponytail] Break time. [Walks over to SpongeBob's chair, sits down, picks up the remote and turns on the TV. TV shows commercial of Nicholas Withers on a small boat with three other fish in the background laying down and relaxing]
Nicholas Whithers: Are you irritable? Listless? Jobless? Have you ever asked yourself: "I'm a loser. What am I doing with my life?" Well, look no further. I have an answer that has helped millions- [Patrick changes channel. TV shows commercial of dolphins swimming and frolicking]
Announcer: Be all you can possibly be. [dolphin noise] Join the Marine Dolphins. [dolphin noise followed by Patrick changing the channel. TV then shows Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cornered by Man Ray with a raygun in his hand]
Man Ray: Muhahahahahahahaha! [Display case falls on Man Ray] Huh? [action card shows: “Clang!”] The inescapable display case! [Bangs on the case] Noooooooooo!
Barnacle Boy: [shakes Mermaid Man's hand] All in a day's work, ehh, Mermaid Man? [both superheroes face the screen]
Mermaid Man: Remember: It's up to you [points up with hand] to reveal the true face of crime. Sign up to be part of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Junior Crime Fighters. [Patrick turns off TV]
Patrick: [gets out of chair.] I gotta figure out what to do in my life. [Patrick steps on Mermaid Man doll that says: "Fight evilllllllll!". Patrick then picks up the toy] Awww, I wish I was a superhero. [Patrick's eyes burst in, then back out] I know what I want to do with my life! To the changing room! [rushes to the changing room followed by a real sea star spinning towards then away from the screen] [scene transition cuts to Patrick pulling out his underwear and putting it on over his pants. Patrick then attempts to put a belt with a buckle with a star on it on, but is hard to put on because of his fat body. He then succeeds and clips the buckle in place] Ahhhhh. [His body fat then bursts in between his belly and his pectorals. He grabs a giant ice cream cone from SpongeBob's fridge, suddenly, with two blue gloves on his hands, and eats the ice cream and a portion of the cone. With ice cream on his mouth, he then slips the cone on his head and bulges his eyes through it. He grabs a jar of seanut butter and writes a backwards P on his chest with seanut butter on his tongue] At last I have found my calling. I am Patrick-Man: defender of Bikini Bottom! [Runs out the front door, then trips on a rock. He gets up and continues running]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what's with all the dilly-dallyin'? We got customer's money  to take!
Squidward: Where? [The Krusty Krab is empty]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Where is everybody?
[The doors open and Patrick appears at the doorway]
Patrick: Fear not, Patrick-Man is here.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick! I knew our number one customer wouldn't let us down. [Patrick comes towards Mr. Krabs to cover his mouth and begins shushing him]
Patrick: It's Patrick-Man, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick-Man? What kind of ridiculous name is that?
Squidward: Oh, forget the name. Look at the ridiculous outfit. What is that? A pair of briefs?
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs start laughing as Patrick looks down at his underwear. Then SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Ooh! Blaring employee laughter in the common area? [SpongeBob joins in the laughter with Squidward and Mr. Krabs] Hey, Patrick, what's with the fancy duds?
Patrick: Must I explain everything? I found what I want to do with my life! I am Patrick-Man!
SpongeBob: [gasps in amazement] That is so exciting! I can't wait to tell Gary, my parents, grandpar- [Before he can finish, Patrick quickly covers his mouth]
Patrick: Shush, SpongeBob! My identity must be kept secret! My work here is done. Patrick-Man is off! The city needs my help! [He runs off, but then comes back and holds up a dollar] Oh, I almost forgot, can I get a Krabby Patty?
[bubble transition to high school. We then see three fish coming in the locker room looking at their exams.]
Fish 1: Hey, howdya do on your final?
Fish 2: [showing his paper] I aced it.
Fish 1: [showing his paper] Me, too.
[Two fish laugh while Patrick spies on them from behind a corner]
Fish 2: Looks like all the studying paid off.
Fish teenagers: High five! [They raise their hands to a high five. Patrick gasps at this and runs in between the two teenagers. They hit their hands between the sides of Patrick's head]
Fish 2: Whoa, you okay. man?
Patrick: Just remember this: Violence solves nothing!
Fish 2: Violence? But we were just giving high fiv--.
Patrick: No time for silly-talk, citizen. Patrick-Man is needed elsewhere! [He runs off leaving the two fish teenagers to look at each other in confusion]
[bubble transition to a street corner. Mr. Krabs and Mabel are standing in front of a street]
Mr. Krabs: Please, ma'am, allow me. [Mr. Krabs grabs Mabel's bag that is in-between them]
Mabel: Huh? [Turns her neck, but uses her hands instead] Why, thank you, young man. [Street sign switches from "don't walk" to "amble"]
Mr. Krabs: Hehehehe, not a problem, ma'am. It's the least I can doooooo! [Mr. Krabs spots a dollar on the street. The dollar is carried away by the wind] Sorry, lady, you're on your own. [Street sign switches from “amble” to “scamper”]
Mabel: Oh, dear. [Sign goes from scamper back to don't walk] [Cars trap Mabel] Oh, dear!
[The dollar that was blown away is placed on the sidewalk. Mr. Krabs skids up to claim it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sweet dollar. Oh, just look at you. So clean. So crisp. Now come to Krabsy. [Mr. Krabs tries to seize the dollar, but is hand chopped by Patrick-Man.]
Patrick: Halt! Patrick-Man is on to you! Thief! Stealing is bad! Bad!
Mr. Krabs: But I found that dollar!
Patrick: Nah, enough! This dollar shall stay on the sidewalk, where it belongs. [Places dollar back on sidewalk] With Neptune's swiftness, away! [Attempts to fly, but is pushed down by gravity. He then walks with his face on the floor]
Mabel: [walks up to the sidewalk] Hey, a dollar! [Picks up the dollar and gasps. She proceeds to put the dollar in her shirt] This must be my lucky day.
[Scene fades to Flipper's Donuts and shifts over to Patrick eating a donut in the garbage container at the back. A distant call for help is heard]
Patrick: Sounds like another job for Patrick-Man! [Licks the doughnut glaze off his mouth] I'll finish you off later, day-old donuts. Right now, I must move rapidly and act heroically! [Patrick walks to the source of the call at Mrs. Puff's Boating School] What's this? [Mrs. Puff is shown trying to open the door of a boat with her student, Nat, trapped inside] Don't move, and freeze!
Mrs. Puff: Huh? [Patrick-Man throws a net around Mrs. Puff.]
Patrick: Let's see you try to bust outta that, boat thief!
Mrs. Puff: Boat thief? Heavens, no! My poor student is trapped inside this boat! The doors are jammed!
Patrick: Jammed doors, huh? [Writes a note and attaches it on Mrs. Puff] A likely story. With Neptune's swiftness, [Patrick-Man yet again attempts to fly, but is again pushed down by gravity] away! [He walks away with his body down again. A police van shows up shortly after]
Mrs. Puff: Ah, merciful Neptune! The authorities are here. You'll be out of there in no time.
Officer John Slugfish: Well, what do we have here? [Plucks note off and reads it. The note says: "Kops!! this iz Bote Theef -Patrick-Man"] Looks like Patrick-Man caught another one! [With Police Officer 2 next to him, they both take off their hats] What would we do without superheroes? [Mrs. Puff is thrown into the van]
Mrs. Puff: But, I didn't do anything!
Officer John Slugfish: Grand Theft Vessel is a felony. You remember what a felony is, don't you, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: Felony?! Yes, I...! Oh, ugh. Patrick-Man... [Police Van drives away]
Nat: Help?
[bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Order up! Another Krabby Patty for the gentleman.
Harold Reginald: Thank you. Let's hope Patrick-Man doesn't confiscate this one.
Tina: Yeah! He drank my shake, too! Said it was part of an evil plot.
SpongeBob: Eh, sorry, ma'am. I'll get you another. Patrick has taken things too far. [Patrick is on his body on the kitchen floor]
Patrick: Hey, that's Patrick-Man to you. [Patrick gets up, revealing several wood pieces and burns on his body from sliding on the floor]
SpongeBob: What're you doing out there?
Patrick: Something a non-hero civilian would never understand. [Plucks a wood spike out of his body and screams in pain] I'm about to unmask one of Bikini Bottom's biggest foes! Right here in the Krusty Krab. And I've intercepted his evil schemes! [Shows SpongeBob a card order of a recipe for coral bits]
SpongeBob: You've intercepted a recipe for toasted coral bits. Don't you think you're going a little overboard with this Patrick-Man thing?
Patrick: Overboaaard?! You call this overboard?! Away with Neptune's [Tries to jump through order window, but gets stuck] Swiftness! [Tries to pull himself through, but his fat body is wedged tight in the window] Villains and criminals, beware! [Keeps trying to pull himself free from the window] Patrick-Man is here! [Patrick pops out of the window, launches into Squidward and is sent flying past Mabel sitting at a table]
Mabel: Good gracious. [Turns neck again with hands]
Patrick: And he always finds out who hides under the mask! [Goes up to blue Fred and attempts to rip his face off]
Fred: Hey, man, I'd like to hold onto my face, thank you!
Patrick: Oh, right. [Walks up to two fish, male and female, and tries to rip their faces off] Gotcha!
Male Fish: Yeouch! Let's get out of here and never come back. [Mr. Krabs bursts out of his office and suddenly gets a super-stretched neck]
Mr. Krabs: Whaaaaaaaat?[Patrick tries to rip another fish's face off] Alright, that does it!
Patrick: Admit it, masked marauder!
Mr. Krabs: Enough! [Pulls Patrick and carries him away] We've all had our fill of Patrick-Man!
Patrick: But I was about to unmask a supervillain!
Mr. Krabs: Sure you were. [Patrick grabs Mabel's head] What the barnacles are you doing?
Patrick: Protecting Bikini Bottom from a scoundrel!
Mabel: Ohh, dear!
SpongeBob: Let her go, Patrick!
Patrick: No way! [Patrick rips off Mabel's head, which is actually a mask. SpongeBob gasps. The Dirty Bubble emerges from the clothes of Mabel and laughs maniacally] Hey! Where'd he come from?
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Dirty Bubble?!
Patrick: The Dirty Bubble? I wanted to unmask Man Ray.
Dirty Bubble: Fools, you blew my cover! Now taste my wrath!
SpongeBob: What now, Patrick?
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're looking at a superhero. So naturally, I will rely on my superpowers, [Picks up a barrel] and throw some stuff! [Patrick throws the barrel and hits Squidward]
Dirty Bubble: [laughs] I wouldn't call that a total miss. [Patrick has a table in his hand]
Patrick: Take this, beast! [Throws table, along with another barrel, but both miss. The table hits the cashier boat and the barrel hits the glass wall of the Krusty Krab and shatters it. Patrick grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Wha, no, Patrick! [Patrick throws him]
Dirty Bubble: Haha, yummy sponge.
Mr. Krabs: You've disabled my employees and trashed me restaurant?! Think you might go for the Bubble now?
Patrick: I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch! [Stench from Patrick's armpit forms a pit and flies toward the Dirty Bubble. The Dirty Bubble swallows it and it hits SpongeBob]
Dirty Bubble: Ha! Let's try that again, but this time, I attack! [Dirty Bubble is flying towards Patrick. Patrick gets scared. He looks down and sees an dirty Krabby Patty and picks it up]
Patrick: Lunch! [Patrick's ice cream cone point pops the charging Dirty Bubble, defeating him. The fish hiding behind the tables cheer in approval and Patrick eats the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Way to go, buddy! You're a hero! Uh, may I have your autograph?
Patrick: Why, of course, young man. That's, uh, SpongeBob with two 7s, right?
SpongeBob: What's your next exciting adventure, Patrick-Man?
Patrick: Actually, [takes off the cone on his head] it's Patrick to you. [Eats cone] I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work.
Mr. Krabs: Not so fast! I think I need you to use your superpowers one last time. [Hands Patrick a broom and a dust pan. Scene zooms out and shows the Krusty Krab with broken furniture everywhere]
Patrick: What's this?


[SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are running through Jellyfish Fields laughing trying to capture jellyfish]
Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] You're it! [both laugh]
SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] You're it! [both laugh. Patrick runs off] Wait, Pat, you're it! [notices a sign a few yards away and yelps. Patrick laughs, not paying attention] The sign!
Patrick: Huh? [tries to read it as he is running] Duuhh... aaann... ger... [crashes through the sign and falls off the cliff] cliff!
SpongeBob: Patrick! [runs down the cliff to Patrick] Let me help you out of there, buddy! [grabs a starfish shaped head out of the ground. When he notices it's just a head, he screams] Is the rest of you down there?
Patrick: [walks up to SpongeBob with no head attached to his body] The rest of me is up here.
SpongeBob: Whew, you had me worried there, buddy. [laughs] Here's your head. [attaches the head onto Patrick and laughs. Picture of inside Patrick's head shows a plug plugging into an outlet. Gears and cranks start up. Patrick gets a spark or two from his head]
Patrick: I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.
SpongeBob: Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'! [takes out two jellyfish nets. Hands a net to Patrick] Go ahead, you get first crack.
Patrick: [jellyfish floats by] Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.
SpongeBob: Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.
Patrick: Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.
SpongeBob: Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets! C'mon, Patrick! [captures a jellyfish] Look, buddy, I captured one!
Patrick: Yes... [shows SpongeBob a notebook with a Davinci-style jellyfish drawn] I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner. [frees the jellyfish from SpongeBob's net]
SpongeBob: Okay...what do you wanna do?
Patrick: Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.
SpongeBob: Pretty.
Patrick: Yes, quite.
SpongeBob: Fragile.
Patrick: Indeed.
SpongeBob: [jumps at Patrick three times] C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun!
Patrick: Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?
SpongeBob: I was thinking more like jumping rope, [jumps rope with his arms] 1-legged races [one leg goes inside his body and he hops on his remaining leg], or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. [jumps into a hermit-crab shell and blows bubbles]
Patrick: Doesn't feel like fun.
SpongeBob: [pops out of the shell] How about some jokes? [Patrick sighs] Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?
Patrick: You can't strum a jellyfish.
SpongeBob: Yes! [laughs. Patrick grabs a jellyfish and strums its tentacles]
Patrick: Oh my, look at the time. I really must be going. [walks off]
SpongeBob: What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon. [at Patrick's house where Patrick is doing some scientific work] Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing?
Patrick: Just studying this amazing subspecies.
Plankton: [through a microscope] I'll show you subspecies!
SpongeBob: Wanna visit Squidward?
Patrick: Well, since I am finished with my work, I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits. [now at Squidward's house where Squidward is playing his clarinet. He hears SpongeBob and Patrick come in and prepares to yell at them] I'd recognize that piece anywhere! Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67, "Symphony in Blue."
Squidward: [very confused] Patrick?
Patrick: It's a beautiful piece. Execution needs some work. [walks over to the piano] May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale.
Squidward: Wow! I never thought to do it like that.
Patrick: Well, that is because you rarely think.
SpongeBob: How do you know so much about music?
Patrick: A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance. [inhales] Ah.
SpongeBob: Does that include... [burps] belch-talk-ing?
Patrick: [waving his hand in front of his face] Mr. SquarePants, I find your humor vulgar.
Squidward: I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick! Do you think you can be my musical mentor?
SpongeBob: Uhh, guys?
Patrick: Let's take it from the top. [Squidward plays, badly] Not so excellent, Squidward. Let me demonstrate the proper technique. [looks at clarinet with spit covered all over the mouth piece] On second thought, practice makes perfect. Let's begin. [SpongeBob comes up playing his musical nose as a flute] Thank you, my good chap. Unfortunately, this is a solo piece for clarinet only. And 1, 2, 3, 4... [Squidward plays more. SpongeBob frowns and walks out. Patrick covers his ears since Squidward's playing is still terrible] Stop! Enough! [walks out] Find yourself a new mentor!
SpongeBob: Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub.
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not.
SpongeBob: Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap! [blows a bubble that pops on Patrick's face]
Patrick: [wiping his face] No, thanks again.
SpongeBob: Well, maybe later we can play pirates.
Patrick: Robert, my dear, it's no use. We've just grown apart.
SpongeBob: What? What do you mean?
Patrick: I know we've had fun in the past, but we're just not compatible anymore. It's time we went our separate ways...such is life.
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] But Patrick, you're my best friend!
Patrick: I know it's hard, but brace up, chap.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Patrick: Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Think fondly of me, Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Goodbye... Mr... Best friend! [sobs. At Sandy's treedome, SpongeBob rings her doorbell] Sandy, you there? I need some professional help. [Sandy and Patrick are heard laughing inside] Patrick?
Sandy: Well, Pat, the new you gets an A+.
Patrick: Why, thank you, Sandra. I find your intellect rather stimulating as well.
Sandy: Oh, really? Well, thanks. [SpongeBob cries then walks away from the treedome, at a chalkboard, there's an equation on it] Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?
Patrick: [changes formula] You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient. Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought.
Sandy: [angrily puts her hands on her hips] What do you mean by that, Patrick?
Patrick: I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations.
Sandy: Are you suggesting I'm dumb?
Patrick: I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'.
Sandy: I think you'd better leave.
Patrick: I was only trying to help. [walks off]
Sandy: I don't need your kind of help, Mr. know-it-all! I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!
SpongeBob: [sitting on his chair at home, crying] I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!
Patrick: [sitting on his chair at home] Surrounded by knowledge and no one to share it with. No one I can call friend. Who's that old chap I used to run with? [notices a book on the table next to him called 'MY FRIEND SPONGEBOB'] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [looks at his 'MY FRIEND PATRICK' book] Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories. [SpongeBob looks at several pictures of him and Patrick together, as SpongeBob begins to cry another picture is shown, it's revealed that Patrick is the one who put a tear on the last picture]
Patrick: Aww, the glory days. Why have we grown apart? I must apply all that I know to solve this problem! [looks at x-rays of him and SpongeBob's head, meditates on top of his rock, studies Squidward, reads a book. He puts the book down and shows his bloodshot eyes] What could it be? [applies a chemical on his head and grows hair] What's different? Ah! [tears out his hair] What?! I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!
SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Coming... [opens door and gets kidnapped in a jellyfish net. Patrick is shown carrying the net over his shoulder with SpongeBob inside. SpongeBob pops out happily] Patrick, you're kidnapping me?
Patrick: Yes, I am.
SpongeBob: Yay! [jumps out of the net and writes "Yippie" in the air with bubble soap] What should we do?
Patrick: We are going to have fun, whatever the cost may be.
SpongeBob: Let's do this.
Patrick: Yes, let's have some fun.
SpongeBob: [jumping around] Oh, yeah!
Patrick: [jumping around] Oh, absolutely! [now riding on a shell down a mountain] Are you quite sure I found this activity to be fun?
SpongeBob: Yeah! [screams with enjoyment. Shell lunges them into the sand] That was fun, huh Patrick?
Patrick: [Swallows a mouth-full of sand] When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.
Patrick: That's it! [runs off]
SpongeBob: That's what? Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha...an...nge! [falls off the cliff]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Hold on, buddy! [takes Patrick out of the ground] There ya go. [notices he has no head and screams] Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again! [searches around some coral] Not back there. [checks under a rock] Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh, poor headless Patrick! [turns around and runs into Patrick making his head pop out] Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different?
Patrick: Quite unchanged, actually.
SpongeBob: I guess we'll never have fun together again.
Patrick: You said you found my dislodged cranial cap last time.
SpongeBob: Yes.
Patrick: Where exactly did you find it?
SpongeBob: Uhh, it was right here.
Patrick: Hmmm, impossible! If I landed here, the trajectory of my dismembered skull would cause it to come to rest, not there, but here, exactly five meters due north.
SpongeBob: But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over... [sign says 'Brain Coral Field'] Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy. [blows off the Poison Sea Urchins off Patrick's head] Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and sophisticated to be my friend again?
Patrick: Knowledge can never replace friendship. I prefer to be an idiot!
SpongeBob: Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal. [Patrick takes off his coral head and SpongeBob puts his old one back on] Patrick? Say something, Patrick.
Patrick: [burps] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're back!
Patrick: Patrick, you're back. [both laugh, then pull out their jellyfish nets, make oo-loo-loo sounds, and run off into the sunset]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick, who are seen playing a board game between Patrick's rock and Squidward's house.]
Patrick: I don't get it! What's an audit?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Let me check the rules. [drops the giant rule book on the ground, opening it] Playing "Certified Public Accountant" isn't as much fun as I thought. [he slides the book away] Maybe it'll be funner if we play louder!
Patrick: [grabs the dice, shaking it] [screaming] I am rolling the dice! [he rolls the dice] [screaming] now I am moving! [he picks up a piece and puts it in another spot, picking up a card while screaming] "Run... spreadsheets?" 
SpongeBob: What does that even mean?! [screaming] [As SpongeBob is talking, the screen goes over to Squidward, who is sunbathing. Squidward, annoyed by their shouting, turns up the volume on his iPod.]
Patrick: [screaming] Well, maybe I’m supposed to run around with this sheet we spread on the ground!
SpongeBob:  [screaming] Yeah, that sounds right to me!
[Patrick flips the sheet and all the pieces to the game fall on Squidward. Squidward gets irritated as Patrick runs around with the sheet while SpongeBob laughs.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Wanna play "Certified Public Accountant" with us?
Squidward: Oh, let me think. That sounds so, [yells] no!
[Patrick keeps running around with the sheet until he trips on the game board.]
Patrick: I don't think this game is ripe.
SpongeBob: Yeah, maybe it got picked too soon.
Squidward: [scoffs] What? Do you think that games grow on trees? [laughs]
Patrick: Doesn't everything grow on trees?
Squidward: No, you ninny! Somebody makes them.
Patrick: Makes them?
Squidward: Yeah. Somebody thinks up the game, then they make the game.
Patrick: Then I could make a game?
Squidward: No, you couldn't. You would be incapable.
SpongeBob: Well, I think Patrick could make up a game.
Squidward: Your operative word there is “think.”
Patrick: Yeah! The opernive... word is think! [laughs] Thanks, Squidward! I'll do it!
SpongeBob: Go get'em, Patrick!
Squidward: [sighs as he rubs his head] Double morons.
[The scene changes to Squidward at the Krusty Krab. Patrick comes in.]
Patrick: I invented a game! I invented a game!
Squidward: Whoopee. Do tell.
Patrick: Well, you know how hard "Tic-Tac-Toe" is and how it always takes so long to play?
Squidward: Uh-huh.
Patrick: Yeah! Well, I made it easier and faster!
Squidward: [sighs] I know I'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but what have you got?
Patrick: It's called... [Patrick holds out a notebook] "Tic-Tac"! You start with two lines that are crossed. And then the first person puts an X. And then the next person puts an, uh... [thinks]
Squidward: O?
Patrick: Oh, yeah! An O! And the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, "Tic-Tac"!. [rips off the paper and laughs] You start!
[Squidward draws an X then Patrick draws an O. Squidward draws another X and draws a line through them.]
Squidward: Tic-Tac.
Patrick: Uh... [rips off paper] Best two out of four?
French Narrator: Many Tic-Tacs later...
[Squidward and Patrick had been playing "Tic-Tac" for a while. As they played one more time, Patrick becomes worried as Squidward draws in the notebook.]
Squidward: Tic and Tac.
Patrick: I should've gone with my first idea: "Tic".
[The scene changes to Squidward riding his recumbent bicycle. Patrick runs up to him.]
Patrick: Squidward, I got a new game! It's called "Rock, Paper, Butter"!
[Patrick holds out a stick of butter melting in his hand.]
Squidward: Butter invent a different game! [laughs]
[Squidward rides away as Patrick eats the stick of butter and sulks sadly back home. The scene changes to Squidward watering his garden. Patrick shows up with two ropes. A long one and a short one.]
Patrick: Squidward, I got it! [throws the ropes on the ground] Whose rope is longer? You... [Squidward picks up the long rope before Patrick finishes] Aww! You played this before!
[Patrick walks away angrily. The scene changes to Sandy's treedome.]
Patrick: Sandy, I've been trying to invent a game, but every game I invent is a failure.
Sandy: [puts some stuff in her blender] If you want to invent a game, you should study all the games you like and figure out what it is you liked best about them. [mixes her blender] Then you can use those elements in the game you invent. [drinks the smoothie she made from her blender]
[Mini Brain Patrick pops out of Patrick's eye and throws a light bulb above his head. Once Mini Brain Patrick puts Patrick eye back in place, Patrick pulled the rope and lights up the light bulb, which helped him get an idea.]
Patrick: [gasps] I know what to do!
[The scene changes to Patrick's rock and all of Patrick's board games are stacks on a table.]
Patrick: And so it begins.
[Patrick begins creating his game. First, he takes a game piece, puts glue on it, and adds google eyes. Then he cuts a board game in half with the scissors, which resulted in cutting himself in half. Then he glues the board together and puts some tape on it. However, the tape slides off because the glue was still wet, but Patrick didn't mind. Patrick continued working on his game for a few hours, and by the time he was finished, he pulled the lever and electricity starts bringing the game to life as if he was a mad scientist bringing a robot to life in a horror movie.]
Patrick: [laughs maniacally] It's a game! It's a game! Now I know what it's like to be a game maker!
[The scene changes to Sandy, Squidward and SpongeBob walking to Patrick's place at night.]
Squidward: I don't see the point of this game night. Every game that Patrick has "invented" is more pointless and boring than the last.
Sandy: This time, he did research.
Squidward: Well, if it's started, then I'm already bored.
Sandy: Well, I'm excited! We're gonna be the first people to test out Patrick's game!
SpongeBob: This is gonna be written about in the history book someday.
Squidward: Yeah. In crayon.
[Everyone shows up at Patrick's rock and Patrick comes out.]
Patrick: Good evening. Please step into my gamatourium.
[Everyone steps inside Patrick's rock.]
Squidward: More like a lamatourium. Ha.
[Patrick closes the rock and lands on his chair.]
Patrick: Welcome, gamers! And behold! [thunderclaps] My game!
[Patrick's game board is made out of random board games and is shaped like Patrick himself.]
SpongeBob: It's beautiful!
Squidward: [yawns] Are we finished? Who won? [Sandy, disgusted by Squidward's rude behavior, hits Squidward's arm]
Patrick: [laughs] No, my friend. We have only just begun.
Sandy: What's it called, Patrick?
Squidward: Might I suggest "garbage"? [Sandy growls at Squidward] What?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick. What's it called?
[As Patrick thinks, Mini Brain Patrick pushes a light bulb out of his head and it lights up.]
Patrick: It's called... Patrick! The Game! [thunderclaps]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Squidward: Could we just get started already? I'm late for my coma. [Sandy zips Squidward's mouth shut]
Patrick: Alright! [eats some snacks] I'll explain the rules. Each player picks a piece to move around the board. The way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice. [As Patrick explains, Sandy and SpongeBob are amazed. But Squidward, on the other hand, was getting impatient] To decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be...
Squidward: Look, Patrick! You go, then Sandy, then SpongeBob, then me! Okay?
Patrick: You mean for picking our player or for starting the game?
Squidward: [annoyed] Both!
Patrick: Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game.
Squidward: I've got a great idea. Why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play.
Patrick: Hmm... [thinks] Okay! [Patrick rolls the dice and gets three dots. He moves his game piece and lands on free money.] Oh, money! [throw money in the air]
[Sandy rolls the dice, moves her game piece and lands on Goo Lagoon.]
Sandy: Yee-haw! Beachfront property! [places a house-shaped piece on Goo Lagoon]
[SpongeBob rolls the dice and gets four dots. He moves his game piece and lands on a treasure chest. SpongeBob takes a treasure which has diver's license on it.]
SpongeBob: Driver's license! Driver's license! But what does that mean?
Patrick: Oh, on your next turn, you roll then you can move down the board or you can go round the race track as many times as you rolled.
SpongeBob: Oh, what should I do? What should I do? What should I do?
Squidward: Could you give me the dice? Give me the dice? Because it's my turn!
[Squidward rolls the dice and gets six dots. Squidward moves his game piece and lands on "Go to jail".]
Squidward: Uh-huh.
Patrick: You go to jail.
[Patrick puts a cardboard box with the word jail on it. Everyone laughs at Squidward as a blue fish head appears next to him.]
Blue Cellmate: What are you in for, pal?
Patrick: My turn! [rolls the dice and spits it out of his mouth] One... two...
[Patrick moves his piece to snacks. Once it landed, snack pops out and feeds Patrick.]
Squidward: Oh, good thing you've landed on snacks. You must be famished.
[Sandy rolls the dice and gets two dots. She moves her piece to Coral Avenue.]
Sandy: Hmm... Coral Avenue. I'll buy it!
[Sandy hands out her money while SpongeBob rolls the dice.]
SpongeBob: Twelve. I'll... drive the car!
[Squidward rolls the dice.]
Patrick: Oh, you don't get to roll when you're in jail.
Squidward: Well, what do I do to get out of jail?
Patrick: You have to roll a six.
[Squidward rolls the dice again.]
Patrick: [screaming angrily] Hey! you can't roll the dice when you're in jail!
SpongeBob: Yeah, play by the rules.
Squidward: Well, if the only way to get out of jail is to roll a six, and I can't roll if I'm in jail, just how am I supposed to get out of jail?! Grrr!
Patrick: [Patrick pulls out a rule card.] Ah, here it is! [writes on it] The guy that is in jail has to stay there unless he rolls a six or someone says his name.
Squidward: [calmly] Fine. Someone say my name.
[Everyone laughs at Squidward. Sandy rolls the dice and moves her piece to surgery.]
Patrick: Oh boy! You landed on "Do a Surgery"! [Patrick holds cards while wearing an operation mask.] Now, pick a surgery card.
Sandy: [Sandy takes a card] Hmm... Remove finbone from player to your left.
[Patrick grabs Squidward and puts him on the game board.]
Squidward: What? Wait! No! But I don't have a finbone! I'm an octopus!
Sandy: Hush, now! This won't hurt a bit.
[Sandy takes the tweezers and removes a plastic bone from the game board.]
Sandy: Got it.
Patrick: Now, sit back down, you criminal!
Squidward: Oh, this game doesn't make any sense!
SpongeBob: Sounds like someone's mad because he hasn't moved.
Squidward: Well, neither have you.
[SpongeBob puts a driving helmet on and starts riding on the board with the race car toy.]
Squidward: [takes off the cardboard box] That's it! I've had enough!
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward! Wait!
Sandy: Don't go, Squidward!
Patrick: No wait, Squidward!
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Patrick: Wait, how'd he get out of jail?
SpongeBob: Squidward made us say his name.
Sandy: That was a smart move, Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? Oh. Hmm... [thinks for a bit and goes back to playing]
SpongeBob: Now you roll after me.
[SpongeBob rolls the dice and gets five dots.]
SpongeBob: Five. One, two, three, four, five. Um, I think I'll...
Squidward: Race the car.
SpongeBob: I'll...
Squidward: Race the car!
SpongeBob: I'll... race the car!
[SpongeBob puts the driving helmet back on and races around the track again. Squidward rolls the dice and gets two dots.]
Squidward: Oh boy! Snacks!
[He moves his piece and lands on snacks. SpongeBob continues racing on the track but his movements literally makes Squidward's piece go back to jail.]
Patrick: Jail for Squidward!
Squidward: But I was on snacks!
Patrick: Tell it to the judge!
[Patrick puts the cardboard box back on Squidward.]
Squidward: Could someone please tell me what we are supposed to be doing? What's the point? This entire game is completely random! It jumps from one thing to another! I don't know how you are supposed to win! And Patrick seems to be making up the rules as he goes along!
Patrick: Starving! Starving sea star time!
[Sandy and SpongeBob feeds Patrick random snacks.]
Squidward: [takes off the box] Okay, I'm going outside.
Patrick: [Patrick writes on his rule card.] If a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside.
Squidward: But I didn't say "outsidies" I said...
[Everyone pushes Squidward outside of Patrick's rock. Patrick rolls the dice and gets four dots.]
Patrick: Four. We are in a giggle zone! Everyone laugh!
[Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick laughs. Sandy growls at Squidward to make him join.]
Squidward: Ha.
[SpongeBob rolls the dice and gets two dots.]
SpongeBob: Two. [takes a card] Silly face! Silly face!
[Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick make silly faces, but Squidward gets very irritated.]
Sandy: Now, that's a silly face!
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, you finally understand the rules!
Squidward: Oh, I get the rules alright! The rules are that it doesn't matter what anybody rolls! You can just make up whatever it means! [takes the dice and rolls them] So, I could just roll the dice and say, "Automatic Winner!"
SpongeBob: Good job, Squidward! You've won!
Sandy: Nice play, Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? Oh, you know what, you're right. That was a good play.
Patrick: Not so fast! [writes on his rule card] No player may declare himself "Automatic Winner."
Squidward: You did it again. You made up another rule! This game is the worst! Stupid game!
[Spongbob and Sandy run off while Squidward grabs Patrick's game board and shakes it off of Patrick. Then he throws Patrick in the air and when Patrick landed, the game breaks in half. Squidward then puts a piece of the game board in his mouth and shakes his head like a dog. He stomps on it with both feet out of insane anger. However, the police arrives at the scene.]
Highway Speed Patrol: Destruction to private property.
[Patrick writes on his rule card and gives it to the police. Squidward tries to walk away but Nancy O'Malley and the Highway Speed Patrol follow him.]
Highway Speed Patrol: Oh, and I see here you are a repeat offender. You're going to real jail.
[Nancy O'Malley and the Highway Speed Patrol grab Squidward and threw him in the police car.]
Squidward: Anything to get out of this game! Thanks, Officers!
Blue Cellmate: Welcome back!
Squidward: Somebody say my name!
[The police car drives away as the episode ends with Patrick appearing on a game board box.]
Patrick: Game over!


[The episode begins at Patrick's house.]
Patrick: Ahh! Sea spider! Sea spider! Sea spider!
[The sea spider roars. Patrick screams and jumps on his sand chandelier. However, when he tries to hold on, it breaks into bits of sand and he falls down. Patrick picks up a sand chair.]
Patrick: Back! Back!
[The chair disintegrates into sand. Patrick backs away and ends up getting caught in the sea spider's web behind him. He tries to free himself but it was no use. The sea spider crawls down Patrick attempts to blow it away. But the sea spider crawls onto him, shoots its web on Patrick's eye and traps him in a cocoon. The sea spider then cuts the web and Patrick falls to the floor.]
Patrick: Whoa!
[Patrick rolls under his sand chair and pops back up with a coupon on his head.]
Patrick: Oh, boy! Here it is! My lost coupon! I found it!
[Patrick breaks himself free from the cocoon and he and the sea spider give a respectful bow.]
Patrick: You have fought well today, sea spider, and now I must leave. For I am going to use this coupon to get an ice cream for my bestest friend in the whole ocean—um.. [looks at his picture with SpongeBob] Sponge Knob Hair Pants! [jumps out of his house and looks around] Hmm. [looks the other way] Hmm!
[SpongeBob appears behind Patrick, slurping an ice cream cone.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: [stutters] Oh.
SpongeBob: What you doin'?
Patrick: I got this here free coupon and I'm gonna get you an ice cream.
SpongeBob: That's nice of you, buddy, but I already got an ice cream.
Patrick: Uh...but I'm getting you an ice cream!
SpongeBob: Why would ya? I already got one.
Patrick: [swats the ice cream cone off of SpongeBob's hand] Because I'm a nice guy! [angrily walks off]
SpongeBob: Wow. There goes the nicest guy.
[The scene changes to Patrick walking past the Krusty Krab. A metal claw comes down and grabs Patrick. Patrick slips off and falls on the ground. The claw grabs Patrick again, but he slips off and falls again. The claw grabs Patrick the third time, and manages to get a grip on Patrick.]
Patrick: Whoa.
[The claw swings him over to Mr. Krabs, who appears to be operating the claw with his construction crane.]
Mr. Krabs: Hooray! I win a free coupon!
Patrick: H-how did you know about my free coupon?
Mr. Krabs: Me back knows. [pulls up his shirt and his hives appear in the word "free"] It breaks out in hives around anything free.
Patrick: [grossed out] Guh.
Mr. Krabs: I also know how heavy a free coupon can be.
Patrick: It's heavy?
[Patrick's coupon falls with the ground. Patrick attempts to lift it, but it's too heavy.]
Mr. Krabs: Much too much responsibility for a carefree fellow like you. Tell you what. I'll take that free coupon off your hands for the price of a hearty handshake. [holds out his hand]
Patrick: Uh...Oh. Ohh! Oh! SpongeBob does love handshakes.
[Patrick goes to do a handshake with Mr. Krabs. All of a sudden, Squidward appears in between them, holding a sandwich.]
Squidward: You should be ashamed of yourself! Taking advantage of a simpleton. [pushes Patrick and eats his sandwich]
Mr. Krabs: Aww, come on. Can't an old crab have a little unscrupulous fun anymore? [leaves]
Patrick: Hey, you ruined my deal! I almost had a handshake!
[Patrick tries to hit at Squidward]
Squidward: [pulls the lever in the crane's controller and sets Patrick down] Oh, you dingdong wing nut! Krabs was just trying to steal your coupon! [walks on Patrick and leaves]
Patrick: Steal my coupon? Hmm. [gasps, backs away and bumps into Dave] You want my ice cream coupon! You can't have it!
Dave: Okay. Whatever.
Orchid: He never really knew how to sing.
Orchid's friend: No! Singers?
Patrick: You.
Both: Hmm?
Patrick: Oh, I see you...peeking at my coupon! It's for SpongeBob's ice cream!
Orchid: [sarcastically] Hooray for SpongeBob.
[Just then, various people arrive and question about the commotion Patrick is making.]
Bikini Bottomites: Hey, what's going on here? [indistinct chatter]
Patrick: Get away from me! All of you! You're all after my coupon!
[Patrick hovers in a fetal position. He begins to hallucinate and sees illusions of people chanting over him.]
Bikini Bottomites: Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon! Coupon!
[During Patrick's hallucination, his coupon flips and Patrick hovers onto it while various people keep chanting over him.]
Patrick: No! You can't have my coupon! No! No!
[In reality, Patrick is in the middle of the street while hovering in a fetal position. Next to him is a motorbike and a police officer eating at the Café Poulpe. His radio buzzes.]
Radio Dispatcher: Officer Slugfish? We got a call about a sea star disturbance on your beat. Please investigate.
Officer Slugfish: Roger, headquarters. Hey, you.
[Patrick turns and looks at the cop. He sprints away.]
Officer Slugfish: Headquarters? I couldn't catch him. He got away. [eats pie]
[Patrick continues to run. He jumps over the fence and crashes in the middle of a little girl's tea party with her friends.]
Little Girl: You're a bad baby!
[The girls beat Patrick up and he runs over the fence with a baby costume on.]
Patrick: Whaa!
[Patrick's baby costume falls off as he runs. He stops in front of the entrance to Clams Theater. Cameras are clicking everywhere. Patrick forms into a flat star on the sidewalk.]
Thaddeus: Oh, look, honey, it's Bikini Bottom's Sidewalk of the Stars. [chuckles]
[The couple take pictures of the sidewalk and notice Patrick.]
Nancy Suzy Fish: This one's gruesome. Hmm, looks like some kids' cartoon. Should we take a photo?
Thaddeus: Nah, waste of film.
[The couple walk away and Patrick straightens himself up.]
Patrick: Ooh. [his coupon gets blown away] Ah! Come back! [grabs the coupon and falls off the cliff] Ah! [lands in front of the Ice Cream Store] I made it. [laughs as he runs into the store] It's beautiful.
[Inside the Ice Cream Store, it was the most amazing thing Patrick has ever seen. There are sprinkle fountains, chocolate syrup waterfalls and rivers, candy cane trees, ice cream mountains, and an ice cream roller coaster that goes around tables. Patrick's mouth begins to water and he slowly walks over to the counter.]
Lou: And a good ice cream day to you, sir.
Patrick: Yes, it's a good day for ice cream!
Lou: And what's your pleasure?
Patrick: Oh, I want your bestest ice cream for my bestest buddy, SpongeBob!
Lou: Excellent choice, sir. One Heavenly Paradise coming up.
[Lou pulls the rubber cow utter and the Heavenly Paradise sundae comes down on a roller coaster cart. The customers cheer and applaud as Patrick's eyes glimmer. The trumpeters blow their candy cane trumpets and the sundae stops right in front of Patrick. Patrick jumps up and down in excitement and the Ice Cream Store employee hands him a spoon. Patrick grabs the spoon and gives the employee his coupon.]
Patrick: SpongeBob won't mind if I just take a little taste.
[Patrick goes to take a taste. When suddenly, the buzzer goes off and the sundae gets pulled away from him.]
Ice Cream Store Employee: Aw, this coupon's out of date. Expired two years ago. Sorry, we can't honor it. [grabs the spoon and leaves]
Patrick: No ice cream for SpongeBob? Huh?
[Patrick grunts loudly as he attempts to snag someone else's ice cream. Patrick begins to lose his sanity and goes into a temper tantrum.]
Patrick: I demand that you honor my coupon! [sobs loudly]
Lou: [grabs his ice cream-themed phone] Temper tantrum in center aisle!
Ice Cream Store Janitor: I'm on it. [pushes Patrick out of the store with his mop]
Patrick: Take my coupon! Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Take my coupon. Ah, take my—
Ice Cream Store Janitor: You poor, miserable creature.
Patrick: I'm miserable.
Ice Cream Store Janitor: You wretched, worthless, shabby—
Jimmy Gus: Hey, don't you think you're being a little harsh?
Ice Cream Store Janitor: Not really. Look at him.
Jimmy Gus: [looks at Patrick] Uh! Never mind. Continue and bump it up a little bit.
[The Ice Cream Store janitor lifts Patrick up with his mop.]
Ice Cream Store Janitor: Listen, buddy, there is one person who can honor this coupon; the person who owns this store. The Ice Cream King himself.
Patrick: The Ice Cream King?
Ice Cream Store Janitor: Oh, yeah. He lives up there in that mansion.
Patrick: Wow.
Ice Cream Store Janitor: Do you need a push?
Patrick: Yeah. Would you, please?
[The Ice Cream Store janitor pushes Patrick with his mop and Patrick runs up the mountain in a fast pace. He manages to reach the mansion and knocks on the door.]
Patrick: Hello?
[The door opens and two eyes are seen. A pink arm grabs Patrick and pulls him in. Inside the mansion, there are pictures of ice cream and the Ice Cream King. In the middle is a tall throne that looks like ice cream. The creature who pulled Patrick inside was the Ice Cream King himself, who appears to be almost identical to Patrick.]
Ice Cream King: Are you the exterminator?
Patrick: Oh. [laughs] No. I'm not the extra gator. I'm here to redeem my coupon for a free ice cream! It's for my bestest friend, but it's out of date.
Ice Cream King: [points to a pile of coupons] They're all out of date because I don't know what year it is.
Patrick: I don't know what anything is.
[Patrick and the Ice Cream King look at each other.]
Ice Cream King: Are you smart or dumb?
Patrick: [thinks for a bit] Apples?
Ice Cream King: Genius! Let's see your head. [squeezes Patrick's head] I can't feel your brain.
Patrick: [lifts his foot with his brain appearing in it] It's down here today.
Ice Cream King: [lifts his foot with his brain appearing in it] Mine too! High five!
[They do a high five but end up hitting each other.]
Ice Cream King: Secret handshake?
[They both slap each other and fly around all over the place until they stop.]
Ice Cream King: Perfect! You don't know the secret handshake either. Hey, I don't know your name. [pushes Patrick]
Patrick: Hey, you're right! [pushes the Ice Cream King]
Ice Cream King: [snatches the coupon from Patrick] This may still be redeemable according to the fine print.
[Patrick attempts to read the fine print, but he can't see it. He pulls his eyes out.]
Patrick: I didn't bring my reading eyes.
Ice Cream King: Try my glasses! [holds up two glasses]
[The Ice Cream King puts the two glasses on Patrick's eye sockets and Patrick reads the fine print.]
Patrick: Oh, ooh. It says "garbaldy goop."
Ice Cream King: But spelled backwards is... [words in black and white] "Poog Ydlabrag." The King's Challenge!
[The scene changes to Patrick and the Ice Cream King sitting on an ice cream sandwich mat.]
Ice Cream King: Hair growing contest! [strains and grows himself eyebrows] Ah-ha!
Patrick: Wow. Oh... [strains as he grows a beard on his chin]
[The Ice Cream King looks at Patrick's beard, but is not overly impressed by it.]
Ice Cream King: That's sad. Watch this. [strains for a bit and grows himself a hairdo] Try beating that.
Patrick: Oh, man. [strains for a bit but cannot grow anymore hair]
Ice Cream King: Ha, ha! I beat you.
Patrick: Not so fast! [shows armpit hair] Ha! Can I redeem my coupon now?
Ice Cream King: Not just yet. Best two out of three.
[The Ice Cream King grabs Patrick and they dress each other in Ice Cream wrestling outfits. They both give each other a respectful bow and begin their fight.]
Both: Ooh.
Ice Cream King: [does his action pose] Your butterscotch style is strong, Low Fat, but it is no match for my brownie bits!
Patrick: Ha, ha, ha! You'll wish your cone was a cup when I whip you into cream! Hi-ya! [shouts as he does he action pose]
[The Ice Cream King and Patrick charge at each other and begin their fight. As they fight, their wrestling outfits break apart.]
Patrick: They told me you had scoops, but your serve is soft. I see you've studied the ancient art of failure! [smacks the Ice Cream King's butt] Redeem my coupon!
Ice Cream King: [gets up] Think fast— [shoots rainbow sprinkles from his hand] rainbow sprinkles!
[Patrick uses the two glasses on his eyes to deflect the sprinkles. The sprinkles land on Patrick's tongue and he eats them.]
Ice Cream King: You have played with skill and courage. I will honor your coupon.
[Patrick giggles and claps. The Ice Cream King pulls out an ice cream cone covered with hair from his armpit.]
Ice Cream King: One free ice cream cone!
[The two glases fall off of Patrick's eyes as he is shocked. The scene changes to Patrick arriving at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob opens the door.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Patrick. What's up?
Patrick: I was gonna give you this ice cream, [holds out the melted ice cream cone] but it melted. Instead, I got you this hearty handshake. [holds out one of Mr. Krab's claws]
SpongeBob: Aw, I love hearty handshakes, but not as much as I love ice cream!
[SpongeBob points to the Heavenly Paradise sundae in the middle of the living room.]
SpongeBob: [holds up a spoon] Care to join me?
Both: Whoo-hoo!
[Patrick and SpongeBob jump into the sundae and ice cream splatters all over the screen. The ice cream splatter forms the words, "The End," ending the episode.]


[The episode starts off with Patrick laughing in his house]
Patrick: Giddy-up! Hyah!
SpongeBob: Weren't you going to put your vacation slides in the projector, Patrick?
Patrick: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [takes out some hash browns]
SpongeBob: Patrick, those are hash browns.
Patrick: Hash browns! [engulfs the hash browns in his mouth]
SpongeBob: Um, Patrick, the slides.
Patrick: Right. The slides. [takes out the slides from his belly button] Voila! Uh, now what?
SpongeBob: Now you put the slides in the projector.
Patrick: [chuckles &amp; snaps] I knew that. Put the slides in the projec-- [the stool collapses and the projector breaks into pieces] ...tor. Don't worry, SpongeBob. I've got something even better. [turns off the lights and turns on the lamp, shining the light at the projector screen] Okay, here we go. [makes shadow puppets of his rock] There I was...
SpongeBob: [claps] Ooh, a shadow puppet show!
Patrick: Please, no interruptions.
SpongeBob: Sorry.
Patrick: As I was saying... [clears throat] I was lying around my house, not even planning to have a vacation when I heard a knock at my door. [Flashback. SpongeBob walks up to Patrick's rock and knocks on it. Patrick moans] For clammin' out loud! Aww, sheesh! I'm still not there yet? [grunts. Opens his rock with a key. SpongeBob jumps inside and sees Patrick laying on the floor with the key in his hand]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick, what have you done to yourself?
Patrick: [panting] I've been waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping for my whole life without a rest! I need a break from the hustle and bustle of my everyday life. [breathlessly] It's so exhausting. [cries] Help me, SpongeBob. Please, help me.
SpongeBob: Pal, what you need is a vacation.
Patrick: That's it! I need a vacation! [cut to Bikini Travel Agency]
Travel Agent: So, you'd like a vacation.
Patrick: [gasps] Oh, great. Another thing for me to d--
SpongeBob: [covers Patrick's mouth] Yes, he'd like a vacation.
Travel Agent: Well, your options are endless, Mr. Star. Anywhere from beautiful white sandy beaches to exhilarating jungle safaris. It all depends on your budget. [SpongeBob and Patrick stare at him. They get booted out]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Ugh!
Patrick: I guess I'll just have to stay home.
SpongeBob: "Stay home"? That's it! You can take a "stay-cation."
Patrick: Wh-what's that?
SpongeBob: Take a vacation at home. No packing, no travel, just do whatever you want to do. Best of all, it's free.
Patrick: Oh, boy! [cut to later at Patrick's house]
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick. Enjoy your stay-cation.
Patrick: That's what I'm gonna do, buddy. [goes into his rock and walks up to a check in counter]
SpongeBob: [dressed up in a hotel suit] Welcome to Star Rock Inn, sir. My name is Todd. Can I check you in?
Patrick: I don't know. Can you?
SpongeBob: Ah, yes. Star, Star, Star. [checking in the computer for Star] Patrick Star, room 801. [gives him a key] Your key, sir. And please don't hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable. [rings bell twice and is now dressed as a luggage man] May I take your bags, Mr. Star?
Patrick: I don't have any ba-- [SpongeBob gives him two suitcases] Oh... [SpongeBob takes the suitcases back]
SpongeBob: Follow me, sir. Your room is right this way. [opens a door that leads to a bedroom] Your room, sir.
Patrick: Oh, dear.
SpongeBob: Something wrong, Mr. Star?
Patrick: Well, um, honestly, I'm not sure I like the way this room is arranged.
SpongeBob: Arranged?
Narrator: One Hour Later.
SpongeBob: Mr. Star, are you sure about this? [standing on top of all the furniture in a pile]
Patrick: No, I--uh, maybe it's the walls. [SpongeBob deflates and all the furniture crashes into a pile of sand] I got it. Let's put the room back the way it was originally!
SpongeBob: [talking about a bathtub full of water] The pool is one of Star Rock Inn's most relaxing features.
Patrick: Ah a pool! [rips off shorts, revealing a black speedo, and walks over to the tub] Where's the diving board?
SpongeBob: The diving board? Ooh, one diving board, coming up. [runs off and puts together a wooden diving board] Your diving board, sir.
Patrick: All right! [laughs and gets on the diving board and does a few flips in the air and hits the bathtub with his head, and then flips into the water]
SpongeBob: You okay, sir?
Patrick: [confused] My head is swimming just fine, thank you.
SpongeBob: Oh, no! [runs off and comes back in a lifeguard outfit] Lifeguard on duty! [blows whistle and pulls Patrick out of the tub] You okay, sir?
Patrick: [teeth chattering] So cold.
SpongeBob: This calls for CPR—candy peppermint resuscitation.
Patrick: So weak. [SpongeBob sticks the candy peppermint in Patrick' mouth] Strength... returning. [licks more of the peppermint. His tummy is rumbling] But I'm still hungry.
SpongeBob: Follow me, sir. [now outside, SpongeBob is dressed as a waiter and puts out a table and a giant rock. He drops the giant rock on his foot which causes it to throb and then deflate] If you would take your seat, sir. [Patrick sits down. SpongeBob puts a bib around his neck] Your dining bib, sir. [Patrick reads it as "who's a good boy"]
Patrick: Wow. What luxury. [SpongeBob, now dressed as a chef, wheels a bbq pit over and gets out a spatula and patty]
SpongeBob: One Krabby Patty coming up.
Mr. Krabs: [clears throat. SpongeBob gives him a dollar] What, no tip?[SpongeBob hands him some coins]
Patrick: Hey, what kind of resort is this? Where's the entertainment?
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, you are absolutely right, sir. [jumps on the table] Presenting the SpongeBob Follies! [vocalizes music while dancing] What the hey.
Patrick: Boring. [SpongeBob does a magic trick. Patrick scoffs] Lame. [SpongeBob swallows a pineapple]
Man: Three, two, one, liftoff. [SpongeBob shoots the pineapple out of his head and into an airplane's turbine, slicing the pineapple's skin off and cutting it into little parts, and back down onto the table]
SpongeBob: Well, what do you think?
Patrick: You are smokin'!
SpongeBob: Aw, it was nothing.
Patrick: No, no, you're really smoking!
SpongeBob: What? [sniffs and sees the patty is burning] Oh, no, the Krabby Patty! [the black smoke fills up around him and Patrick. Patrick exits through the back and his tummy is rumbling again]
Patrick: My tummy is still lonely. [sniffs the aroma in the air] Ahh.[sees the aroma is coming from behind Squidward's kitchen where he is making some sort of stew]
Squidward: [sinffs the stew] Ah. [licks some more] Ah, delish. [brings a bowl of stew to the table] Oh, silly me. I forgot the napkin. [walks off to get it from the cabinet] And now an elegant meal for an elegant person. [walks back to the table to see Patrick eating his stew]
Patrick: I am quite refined. [slurps the rest of the bowl] Ah! [burps]
Squidward: What are you doing here?
Patrick: I'm on vacation! The last resort I was staying at was a dump, but this place is awesome. Oh, hey, waiter... [snaps] a napkin, please. [Squidward growls]
SpongeBob: [coming out of the black smoke with a burnt patty on a plate] Mr. Star, your meal is ready. [Krabby Patty dissolves into dust and blown away by the wind] Patrick, where is he? [Squidward screams] Ah!
Squidward: Patrick, you dimwitted moron, get out of my kitchen!
Patrick: Good idea. I think I'll head over to the spa. [bones crack] I could use a massage.
Squidward: Get this into your tiny, tiny, little, tiny brain—this is not a resort. It's my house. There is no spa. And you can't get a massage!
Patrick: [moaning] Oh, yeah, that's the spot. [SpongeBob is giving him a massage] Hey, you should get a massage, too.
Squidward: [scoffs] Not likely. [bones crack] Ow ow ow ow! What the hey?! [pushes Patrick off the table] Move over. I want a deep tissue treatment and don't forget the feet.
Narrator: 5 Hours Later.
[Squidward is sleeping and SpongeBob is tired out]
SpongeBob: So tired. [goes into his house and gets into bed. Sighs but notices snoring is coming from Patrick] Patrick, what are you doing here?
Patrick: That resort next door is too crowded. Then I found this place. It's quiet and peaceful. Good night, SpongeBob. [snores. Cut to Mr. Krabs gargling in front of his sink. Goes into his room, turns on the light, and sees SpongeBob in his hammock, snoring]
Mr. Krabs: Wake up, laddy.
SpongeBob: Hmm? Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You have another nasty old dream?
SpongeBob: Mm-mmm.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick in your bed again?
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm.
Mr. Krabs: Aye. Well, good night, laddy.
SpongeBob: Good night, sir.
[Cricket chirps]


[The episode begins at Patrick's house during the night. A shooting star flies in the sky.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, one more book, then you go to sleep, 'kay?
Patrick: 'Kay.
SpongeBob: This one is called "You Can Be Anything."
Patrick: [blabbers as he spins over his bed] I can be anything?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure you can, pal. [opens the book and shows the page with a fireman pop-out] You can be a firefighter... [the fireman pop-out sprays water in Patrick's face; SpongeBob turns the page that shows a doctor pop-out] You can be a doctor... [Patrick whimpers; SpongeBob turns the page and shows a cowboy pop-out] You can be a cowboy.
Patrick: That's what I want to be!
SpongeBob: Cowboy. Great choice.
Patrick: No, no, no, no, no! [points to the horse pop out] That.
SpongeBob: A horse? [chuckles] Buddy, I don't think you want to be a horse.
Patrick: You said I can be anything, and—and I want to be a horse!
SpongeBob: Sure, sure, you can be a horse. [tucks Patrick in his sand bed and sighs] Nighty-night, Patrick. [turns out the light and leaves]
Patrick: A horse. [snores] A horse. [his sand underwear falls off, leaving him naked]
[The scene changes to morning and the rooster crows everyone up. SpongeBob is in his bed, sleeping. A horse neighs outside.]
SpongeBob: [groans] Not now, Gary. Give me a few more minutes. [a horse neigh is heard again; SpongeBob wakes up] What? Uh, Gary? [runs to the window]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [looks out the window] Huh? [gasps]
[Patrick neighs like a real horse and starts galloping around. He neighs again.]
SpongeBob: Oh, horsey! [runs outside as he gel falls off his face] Patrick, you were right! You can be a horse.
[Patrick munches on grass like a horse. He looks at SpongeBob and swallows the grass. He chuffs in suspicion.]
SpongeBob: Easy there, big fella. [holds out an apple] Easy...
[Patrick sniffs the apple and eats it along with SpongeBob's arms. The arms open Patrick's mouth and reattach onto SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Ah! [chuckles as he strokes Patrick] That's a good horsey. Hmm, "horsey." That's not right. You need a name! I think I'll call you... Patrick!
[Patrick neighs and lifts SpongeBob with his head.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [lands on Patrick's back and chuckles while he rides] Ride 'em, cowboy!
[Patrick gallops around and shakes SpongeBob off. SpongeBob flies through the air and falls into Norton's mailbag. Patrick neighs.]
SpongeBob: [pops out of the mailbag and chuckles] Uh, bucking bronco.
[Norton grabs SpongeBob and shoves him in the mailbox. He licks a stamp and puts it on SpongeBob's nose.]
Norton: Rodeo clown. [leaves]
[The scene changes to Patrick harnessed with a saddle and reins.]
SpongeBob: Safety first. [puts on a seatbelt and clicks his tongue] Giddy up, Patrick! [Patrick starts galloping] Looking good, Ms. Sandy.
Sandy: Thank you. And the horse you rode in on?
SpongeBob: [passes by a street cleaner] Morning, old timer.
[Patrick farts and the street cleaner moans. He grabs a broom and pooper scooper and goes after them. Patrick gallops over to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob gets off and ties Patrick to the pole. Moments later, kids come by and see Patrick as a horse.]
Kid #1: Can we pet him, mister?
SpongeBob: Sure, but be gentle.
[The kids run over and gently pet Patrick. Patrick sighs heavenly and neighs.]
Kid #2: He's so soft.
Squidward: What's all the hubbub out here? [the kids gasps] What the? [laughs] So Patrick's a horse now? Ha-ha! Your phony baloney pony's more like an old gray mare. [snorts] Sorry to say, but, uh, this one's ready for the glue factory. [slaps Patrick's butt]
[Patrick yelps and kicks Squidward with his legs. Squidward is sent flying backwards.]
Mr. Krabs: What kind of hub—[Squidward crashes into Mr. Krabs in the back] What are you doing violating me personal space? [opens SpongeBob's face and shoves Squidward inside him]
Kids: [runs over to Patrick and continues to pet him] Aw... He's really fuzzy.
[Mr. Krabs sees the kids in the form of dollars as they are petting Patrick. Then, in an instant, he comes up with an idea.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Horsey rides! Kids love horseys. Great idea having Patrick play pony. I'll charge these kids ten bucks a ride and cash in big time!
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know, Mr. Krabs, I think Patrick will only let me ride him.
Mr. Krabs: [draws a sign and chuckles] Oh, nonsense. Pony rides! Ten buckaroos!
[Many kids show up for the "pony ride." Squidward pops out of SpongeBob's head. The scene changes to SpongeBob flipping patties on the grill. The patties are shaped into Patrick, as a horse, giving SpongeBob a ride on his back.]
SpongeBob: [sadly sighs] Giddy up, Patrick. [flips the Patrick-shaped patty] Giddy up.
Squidward: Now, I don't mean to nag, so don't bridle me when I say this, but your dream horse is more like a nightmare! [laughs] Get it? Night? Mare? Ha-ha!
[The children cheers outside. SpongeBob sighs and his eyes are filled with tears. A submarine swims in his tears as a horse neighs in the background. SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen, sobbing.]
Squidward: Oh, yeah, now you're feeling your oats. [laughs] Ha-ha! I'm so good.
[SpongeBob groans and looks out through the front door. Patrick is having a hard time carrying more than one kid on his back.]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Four at a time quadruplicates me money. Let's try for five. [takes a kid's money and chuckles]
[Mr. Krabs puts another kid on Patrick's back. Patrick gets really angry and shakes the kids off his back.]
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh. [catches a kid] Ooh. [catches another] Oh! [catches another] Ooh. [catches another with his teeth]
Kid #3: [hits the ground] My wittle weg!
Kids: Yay!
[Mr. Krabs rolls the kids he caught in a ball and gently flicks them away.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, next up.
[Patrick breaks lose and angrily neighs. Then he gallops away from the Krusty Krab, stepping on the injured kid in the process.]
Kid #3: My other wittle weg!
SpongeBob: [slides through the door and chases after Patrick] Horsey Patrick, come back! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: That's me money running away! Come back!
Squidward: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, come back. I said, "Whoa, horsey Patrick." [gallops like a horse] Look at me. I'm a horse. [chuckles] Clopity, clopity, clopity. [laughs and runs into the restaurant]
[An ambulance's siren goes as paramedics take the injured kid to the hospital.]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles and takes out a pair of reins] Clopity, clopity, clopity.
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is searching for Patrick in a hot and dry desert. Clams in the sky circle above like vultures. SpongeBob climbs up several cliffs.]
SpongeBob: [weakly] Patrick. Patrick... [grunts] Patrick. [climbs up] Patrick! [groans as he falls flat on his face]
[SpongeBob looks up and sees Patrick galloping towards him. The sand surrounds SpongeBob and he coughs. As the sand clears away, Patrick stands proudly with seaweed as a horse's mane and tail. Patrick rears up and neighs.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick? [Patrick chuffs] Hey, it's okay, boy. It's me. [Patrick neighs] Your old pal, SpongeBob. [eats an apple, but also eats his hands] Remember? [Patrick chuffs; he and SpongeBob circle around] Okay... Would you like me to whisper? [Patrick neighs] Nice Patrick. Pretty Patrick. Good Patrick. [takes out a rope and lassos it on Patrick's neck; Patrick struggles to break free] Calm down, buddy. I don't want to lose you again. [Patrick rears up, neighs, and flips SpongeBob backwards] Whoa! Ow! Ow!
[Patrick runs over a cactus field and SpongeBob gets pricked by the needles. Patrick runs over a pointy rock field and SpongeBob gets scratched by the rocks. Patrick runs over a pillow field, but the pillows don't seem to harm SpongeBob. Patrick stops running and SpongeBob swings around and around as the rope tangles Patrick's neck. SpongeBob lands on Patrick's back and the rope falls off. Patrick neighs and licks SpongeBob in the face.]
SpongeBob: Aw. And all this time, I thought I was the one breaking you, but you were the one breaking me. [breaks into pieces, puts himself back together, and clicks his tongue] Patrick horsey, giddy up!
[Patrick gallops across the desert with SpongeBob on his back. He jumps over several cliffs and gallops across a canyon. While Patrick is galloping, SpongeBob is seen playing jump rope on his back. SpongeBob surfs on a wave with Patrick as a surfboard. Patrick neighs and gallops across Goo Lagoon. The scene changes o SpongeBob riding Patrick back to the Krusty Krab and this time, Squidward is being the horse for Mr. Krabs "pony ride."]
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Oh, this is humiliating.
Mr. Krabs: Quiet. [shoves reins in Squidward's mouth] Horseys don't talk. Okay, kids, ten bucks a ride! Who's next?
Kid #4: Me! [gets picked up by Mr. Krabs and placed on Squidward's back] Get moving, horse! [kicks Squidward's hips with his spurs]
Squidward: Ow! Cut it out!
Mr. Krabs: [his wristwatch beeps] Ride's over. [throws the kid away] Who's next?
SpongeBob: Wow, Mr. Krabs. How'd you get Squidward to give rides?
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... [pops his eyestalk out to pull out a paper from inside his shell] Says right here in his contract. [rolls down contract] "I can work him like a horse."
Squidward: Huh? [Patrick growls at Squidward; Squidward growls back and they both huff at each other]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, get your mule away from my show pony! This here's a Thoroughbred. [nails horseshoes on Squidward's feet]
Squidward: Huh? [Mr. Krabs lifts him up]
Mr. Krabs: Look at that flank. [stretches Squidward forward] Get a load of those locks. Not to mention that loin, eh?
Squidward: Oh, yeah. I'm a real stud.
Mr. Krabs: Now look at your old pile of dog food. [laughs]
[Patrick looks hideous.]
SpongeBob: I'd put my pile of dog food up against your stud any day!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah? How 'bout a race, then? [holds out two delivery bags] First one to delivery a Krabby Patty to Black Devil Bay wins.
SpongeBob: You're on! [grabs the bag]
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Patrick and SpongeBob getting ready for the "race." Sandy acts as the referee.]
Sandy: I want a clean race. No cheating! Wait for the bell. [rings the bell and the racers begin their race] Ah! [spins around and feels dizzy]
[The street cleaner follows the racers. As Squidward gallops, he leaves behind a cloud of dust.]
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha! Eat my dust!
SpongeBob: Well, okay. [carves a piece of the cloud dust and eats it] Mmm. [carves some more and eats them] Mmm. Hey, your dust was delicious!
[Patrick neighs and runs to catch up. Mr. Krabs, who is not going to play fair, cheats by making a shortcut sign in hopes of getting SpongeBob and Patrick lost.]
Mr. Krabs: This shortcut sign should send SpongeBob and Patrick far from the finish line. [puts the shortcut sign near the tall grass and hops on Squidward's back] Hi-ho, Squidward! [gallops away]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Whoa, shortcut. This could be a trick. I love tricks!
[Patrick gallops through the tall grass and grazes a path for them to walk on. However, the tall grass also leads to a cliff, which sends SpongeBob and Patrick falling on top of Mr. Krabs and Squidward. Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob and Patrick away and cackles evilly. Patrick catches up and runs on his legs.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, whoa! [screams as Patrick runs up farther than Mr. Krabs and Squidward] Hyah! Oh, boy, we're ahead!
Mr. Krabs: No, you're actually behind! [cackles]
SpongeBob: Oh... [sees Patrick running on a treadmill with a moving projector as background] Huh? Whoa, Patrick. Whoa.
[Patrick slips and rolls under the treadmill, which sends them flying in front of Mr. Krabs and Squidward. Mr. Krabs pulls out a slingshot and shots a rock onto SpongeBob. But the rock rolls around SpongeBob's body and shots back at Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: [gets hit by the rock] Oh! [runs in front of SpongeBob and Patrick and takes out a bottle of mustard] Have some slippery mustard, slowpokes! [sprits mustard on the ground, which almost makes Patrick slip; Patrick tastes some of the mustard] That was extra spicy slippery mustard! [laughs, but Patrick blows fire out of his mouth, making them fly past Mr. Krabs and Squidward] Oh, ratfish! [gets another idea] I've got one more trick up me sleeve. [Patrick and SpongeBob continue to gallop, but Mr. Krabs catches up and appears in a police officer while Squidward acts as a police car] This is the police! I'm pulling you over for speeding!
Officer John Slugfish: No, this is the police! I'm pulling you over for impersonating an officer!
[SpongeBob and Patrick gallop all the way over to Black Devil Bay, where their customer, an orange angler fish, is waiting for his delivery.]
SpongeBob: Here's your delivery, sir.
[The angler fish takes the bag and looks inside it. However, there was nothing inside it and he shakes the bag.]
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: [spits out his reins] I was hungry.
[Mr. Krabs and Squidward show up and gives the angler fish the bag. The angler fish eats the Krabby Patty, lights his green light, and leaves.]
Mr. Krabs: We win! We win! [laughs and jumps off of Squidward's back] I—I had the best horsey! I had the best horsey!
Patrick: [rears up] I don't want to be a horse anymore.
SpongeBob: [slides off of Patrick's back] Okay, buddy, but remember, you can still be anything.
Patrick: [takes off the saddle] In that case, I think I'll be... [appears to have Mr. Krabs' claws as arms] a crab! Ark, ark, ark, ark, ark, ark! [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [gasps as he sees his claws gone] Oh, no, you don't! Come back here with me claws! [runs after Patrick]
SpongeBob: [sighs] How 'bout a ride back to the old Krusty Krab, cowboy? [puts on the saddle and bends down]
[Squidward sighs and climbs onto SpongeBob's back. SpongeBob rears up and neighs like a horse. He gallops away into the sunset with Squidward on his back. The street cleaner follows them as the episode ends.]

 
[in Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: Breaker, breaker outer perimeter, looks clear. Over.
Patrick: Robert, Robert...uhh...Ronald, Ronald, Ryan.
SpongeBob: Are you sure you're not trying to say Roger?
Patrick: Oh, wait I got it. Ringo...
[SpongeBob sees jellyfish.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, we have visual contact. Now taking evasive action. Subject still in close proximity. Over.
Patrick: Hello?
SpongeBob: Please reply.
Patrick: I wonder if I can order pizza with these things.
SpongeBob: Please, contact immanent Patrick. Respond now. Please. Please!
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're gonna need to speak up. My eardrums aren't what they used to be.
SpongeBob: I can't speak up Patrick, there's a jellyfish here and I'm worried it might sting me if I make any loud... [SpongeBob bumps Patrick and he screams] ... noises.
Patrick: Oops. [they run away. The jellyfish shrugs it off]
SpongeBob: Is he still after us, Patrick?
Patrick: I don't know, buddy!
SpongeBob: Should we turn around and check?
Patrick: Ok. [they both turn around and trip over something]
SpongeBob: Oh, I think I landed on my pain center.
Patrick: I think I landed on a rock. [Patrick shows a big rock on the back of his head]
SpongeBob: Patrick, look! There's a weird thing sticking out of the ground right there.
Patrick: That's just Squidward sunbathing again. [points to Squidward who lowers down his sunglasses]
SpongeBob: No, not that, Patrick. This!
Patrick: What is it?
SpongeBob: I don't know. I think there's something buried underneath it. And I'm gonna go get some shovels so we can dig it up.
Patrick: We?
[cut to large piles of dirt]
SpongeBob: Phew! Nothing like a little manual labor to put some hair on your chest, eh, Patrick?
Patrick: I'll say. [his entire chest is covered with hair]
SpongeBob: Plus look at what we unearthed! A UFO! [looks inside] Go on, you first. [Patrick climbs down a ladder with SpongeBob following] Kinda dark, huh?
Patrick: Yeah, dark.
SpongeBob: Well, there's gotta be a light switch around here somewhere. Found it. Excuse me, sir. [pulls off a skeleton and proceeds to start the submarine] Hey, Patrick, look! We're moving! And here's the steering wheel!
Patrick: Now hold it, SpongeBob. You better let me drive.
SpongeBob: Gimme that wheel!
Patrick: No! Let go! I wanna drive! [the submarine goes crazy. The scene cuts to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: I don't understand, Squidward. Where are all the customers? I know the Krusty Krab isn't Bikini Bottom's most prestigious eatery, but at least it's better than that salty old Chum Bucket across the street. And that's our only competition.
Squidward: Am I getting paid extra for this conversation?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, come on, Squidward. Can't you just pretend to listen for once in your life? Do it for old Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Well, since you can't bring any customers into the Krusty Krab, have you ever thought about bringing the Krusty Krab to the customers?
Mr. Krabs: Quiet, Squidward, I'm brainstorming! Ooh, ooh! What if instead of bringing customers to the Krusty Krab, we could bring the Krusty Krab to the customers?
Squidward: La la la la la la la la la la la la.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, of course! But how? [the submarine crashes into the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Can we park here? [Squidward looks up] Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey.
Patrick: Or even around the block!
Mr. Krabs: That's it! We'll take the Krusty Krab on the road. [cuts to outside] So long, boys. Make me lots of money!
SpongeBob: Bye, Squidward. Bye, Mr. Krabs. [dreamily] Bye, Squidward.
Patrick: You said "Bye, Squidward" twice.
SpongeBob: I like Squidward.
Plankton: [looking through a telescope] A traveling restaurant, eh? It's not fair! I had that idea years ago! No matter. If Mr. Krabs wants to play dirty, then Plankton's ready for his turn to take his turn. [laughs and turns the fist from the Chum Bucket building into a flying vehicle]
SpongeBob: Hello!
Man: Hello.
SpongeBob: Could I interest you in a Krabby Patty?
Man: No thanks.
Patrick: Now what?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. Mr. Krabs said if we didn't find customers, not to come back. [to Man] Are you sure you don't want to be out first customer, sir.
Man: Yeah, I'm pretty sure. [starts to walk away]
SpongeBob: Wait! We'll pay ya!
Man: Hey, thanks again, guys. Good luck with the restaurant!
SpongeBob: Thank you, sir, come again!
Plankton: Those nincompoops are better salesmen than I suspected. [an alarm sets off]
Voice: Customer approaching.
Plankton: Hello, little boy. Would you like a chum burger?
Boy: Uh, does it come in raspberry?
Plankton: Um, no.
Boy: Blueberry?
Plankton: No.
Boy: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...raspberry?
Plankton: Ah, come on, kid. You asked me that already. Now quit wasting my time!
Mable: Hey, you can't talk to my son that way! Who do you think you are?
Plankton: I'm Plankton, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers.
Truck Driver: Hey, you can't talk about my wife that way. What do you think this is?
Plankton: I think it's time for you to lose some weight, fatty. That's what this is.
Mary: Hey, you can't talk to my grandson like that. Someone oughta put you in a mental hospital.
Plankton: Someone should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma!
Mary: You're probably right.
Plankton: You people are crazy. I'm getting out of here. [a person throws a rock at Plankton] What the? [People start throwing rocks] No! Controls malfunctioning! [people continue to throw rocks]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty? [cut to the kitchen, where the patties are burnt] Oh, no. You burnt all the patties. It's hard as a rock. How are we gonna find somebody who would buy these?
Truck Driver: [sees there are no more rocks] Hey, the rocks are all gone.
Crowd: Aww! [Plankton smiles, but sees SpongeBob coming]
SpongeBob: Folks, have I got a deal for you. [the crowd sees the hard patties. They buy them and proceed to hit Plankton with them]
Jack: Alright, get 'im! [they start to throw the patty rocks at Plankton]
SpongeBob: Won't Mr. Krabs be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing. See any new customers, Patrick?
Patrick: No, but I see a sign. It says. "Warning: Ab...eyes?"
SpongeBob: Here, let me see. [looks through periscope] No, Patrick, that says "Abyss."
Patrick: Oh, OK. What's an abyss, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: An abyss is a bottomless... [SpongeBob turns around, the submarine falls down the abyss] ...chasm! [an alarm goes off] Pat, we're falling!
Patrick: And now we're being bathed in an eerie red light!
Plankton: [he sees them falling] Yes! Yes!
Patrick: [the submarine loses its bolts and breaks in the water] And now a deafening warning siren! [SpongeBob imitates the sound. the submarine hits a sludgy item, which turns out to be the head of the Sea Monster]
Sea Monster: [shouts]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss! [looks at the Sea Monster]
Sea Monster: Hey! [he grabs the submarine] Who are you calling dark and depressing?
SpongeBob: Daa! We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really wanna know is... are you hungry?
Sea Monster: Hungry? I've been asleep for 79 years. Which means my last meal was 79 years ago. Yes, I'm hungry.
SpongeBob: Then try one of our Krabby Patties.
Sea Monster: [he eats the Krabby Patty] Mmm! That's the best thing I've tasted since that sewer spill...back in '76. I'll take 640 of them.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Woo hoo!
Patrick: Order...uh...up! [the Sea Monster gives them large wads of cash]
Plankton: Now that those two are out of the picture, all of the customers will come running to me. [looks at the Sea Monster paying them big money (literally), he rips off the periscope] This calls for drastic-er-est measures! [Plankton goes into the abyss] Okay, you bums, time for the second course; Chum Charges!
Patrick: [the Chum Charges explode around the submarine] SpongeBob! Our hull's been breached. Do you know what that means?
SpongeBob: No!
Patrick: [a close up to SpongeBob &amp; Patrick] Neither do I!
Plankton: Yes! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the... [Plankton sees the vehicle crashing into a cavern wall] Ah, who needs that old Rust Bucket anyhow.
Sea Monster: Come on in there! I want more sandwiches!
Patrick: [a piece of chum enters the submarine] SpongeBob, look!
SpongeBob: What is it?
Patrick: It's a liquid.
SpongeBob: No, it's a solid! It's a solid!
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's a "lol-squid."
Sea Monster: All right, what's going on in there? [he sees the Chum Patty] Hey, that looks like a sandwich to me!
SpongeBob: But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chum-Wich.
Sea Monster: [eats it and likes it] Mmm! Now that's a sandwich!
[cut to a sequence of SpongeBob making Chum-Wiches, Patrick collecting the Chum, and the Sea Monster paying them for the Chum-Wiches]
SpongeBob: [the monsters belly is still rumbling] Anything else before we shove off?
Sea Monster: I want dessert! [Plankton parachutes down]
SpongeBob: We- We don't have desserts.
Plankton: [lands from his parachute] Don't give another penny to those fast-food phonies. That's right, they stole my idea. My, my, my... [the end of the periscope breaks off, he falls down and rolls into some wet mud]
Sea Monster: Hey, a chocolate éclair! [to audience] Now that looks like dessert to me!
Plankton: No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You- You've got it all wrong, see... Hey! [the Sea Monster chases Plankton through the abyss. cut to the Krusty Krab]
Janitor: [repairing the windows SpongeBob and Patrick broke previously] There you are, Mr. Krabs, just like new again.
Squidward: Now all we have to do is keep SpongeBob away from the... [the submarine crashes into the windows again]
SpongeBob: We're back, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Tell me all about it. Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!
SpongeBob: You wouldn't believe it Mr. Krabs, we had so many new customers!
Mr. Krabs: I don't care about that. Tell me about the money.
SpongeBob: There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy.
Patrick: And paper.
Mr. Krabs: You let go of all the money I earned as ballast?
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick nod their heads, Mr. Krabs is upset] But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!


[episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is in Mr. Krabs' office, and all the lights are off.]
SpongeBob: You wanted to see me, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Pull up a seat, boy. [SpongeBob looks around]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, there aren't any chairs.
Mr. Krabs: Sit down! [SpongeBob sits on the floor] Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy.
SpongeBob: Ooh, yes, sir. And they've been the best years of my life, sir.
Mr. Krabs: That said fact aside, midway through today's lunch rush, we ran out of the secret ingredient [Mr. Krabs hold up a bottle] to the secret formuler! [Mr. Krabs holds up the formula]
SpongeBob: [gasps] No!
Mr. Krabs: Listen up, boy, any minute now, a truck driver is going to arrive, and I'm entrusting you to retrieve the secret ingredient! And I need you to do this without any foul-ups! Understand?
SpongeBob: Could you repeat that? [Mr. Krabs looks at his watch]
Mr. Krabs: It's time! [Mr. Krabs presses a button, which makes a siren go off, and locks down the whole restaurant. A truck then arrives with S.W.A.T. team members to make a path from the restaurant to the truck] Now go! And make sure to guard it with your life!
SpongeBob: I won't let you down.
Mr. Krabs: Wait!
SpongeBob: Yes?
Mr. Krabs: If something happens to that secret ingredient... don't bother coming back to work! [SpongeBob gets scared, then walks outside, and up to the truck]
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1: You BobPants?
SpongeBob: Uh, SpongeBob.
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1: Close enough. [hands SpongeBob the case with the ingredient inside] Now get out of here, kid! Plenty of folks would love to get a hold of that ingredient.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [runs back to the Krusty Krab] And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patty, secret ingredienty. [notices that the secret ingredient is not there, and gasps] Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?! No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe? [notices a hole] What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [he hides the case behind his back] What are you doing lollygagging about?! Get back to work!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Right away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Hop to it! There's lots of hungry customers out there!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs trusted me, and I let him down!
Patrick: [suddenly appears] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me.
Patrick: With what?
SpongeBob: With this. [shows him the case. Patrick puts some mustard on it, then puts it on buns]
Patrick: Here you go, buddy.
SpongeBob: Not that kind of help! This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing!
Patrick: What?!
SpongeBob: Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who!
Patrick: Find out!
SpongeBob: You and I are gonna have to do a little detective work! [cuts to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: What are we eating this time, Karen?
Karen: [puts a Krabby Patty on the plate] Something new.
Plankton: Oh, you mean the "secret recipe" I came up with?
SpongeBob: Aha! I knew it was you!
Plankton: What was me?
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!
Plankton: Is this a joke?
SpongeBob: Why don't you tell me. Is it?!
Plankton: Uh, no.
Patrick: [laughs] Good one!
SpongeBob: All right, no more jokes! Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk! [Patrick holds up clackers, then bangs them together]
Plankton: Sorry, I really have nothing for you.
SpongeBob: Then how do you explain this? [picks up the Krabby Patty]
Plankton: Okay, you caught me.
SpongeBob: And so the truth floweth forth.
Plankton: Yes, it is a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm.
Plankton: But, it's my version of a Krabby Patty. [both are confused] After thousands of failed attempts to steal the recipe, I learned all but one ingredient needed to make Krabby Patties. The most important ingredient, the secret ingredient. Over the years, I've methodically gone through almost every letter in the alphabet. Right now I'm on the R's. And I've gotten up to raw sewage.
SpongeBob: [sniffs the patty] Yuck!
Plankton: Try it, tell me what you think. [they walk out of the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: Well, he's clean. But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did?
Patrick: [with bad breath coming out, implying he ate Plankton's patty] Good question.
SpongeBob: Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient. Hmm, a scientist. [cuts to Sandy's treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick sneak up at the treedome, then look around] There she is. [Sandy walks up to her table with a covered plate] You hang back. I'm going in for a closer look. [SpongeBob put's a water helmet on, then drills a hole into Sandy's treedome, then hides behind her tree. Sandy uncovers the plate, revealing Krabby Patties. SpongeBob gasps] Oh, my gosh! It is Sandy! [Sandy digs a hole, and buries the Krabby Patty in it] Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady?
Sandy: SpongeBob! How long have you been standing there, buddy?
SpongeBob: Oh, long enough, "buddy."
Sandy: I was just storing food for the impending winter. Want one?
SpongeBob: I'm onto you, squirrel. [sniffs the patty] You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together. I know exactly how you got all those patties.
Sandy: What exactly are you getting at, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: What I am getting at, is that you... [screen cuts to what SpongeBob is explaining] ...cloaked yourself an invisibility potion, snuck through the security perimeter... [Sandy picks up one of the S.W.A.T. Team Member]
S.W.A.T. Team Member 2: What was that?
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1: Here's the secret Krabby Patty ingredient.
SpongeBob: ...then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient, [cuts back to SpongeBob and Sandy] reverse engineered it, and made your own patties, so you wouldn't have to pay.
Sandy: Or, perhaps I walked into the Krusty Krab, purchased them, [holds up a receipt] and received a receipt for these legally obtained patties!
SpongeBob: [reads receipt] 283 Krabby Patties. [laughs nervously] That's right, I cooked this order. I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility.
Sandy: SpongeBob, next time before you run around accusing people of things, make sure your own house is in order first!
SpongeBob: My own house, huh? [Cut to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Patrick have Gary cornered against a wall, with a light above him] Why'd you do it, Gary?!
Gary: [frightened] Meow.
SpongeBob: You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary. Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth! Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it! [scene cuts to what SpongeBob is explaining again] First, you hitched a ride on a security chopper, then jumped into the drop zone. Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tear ducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient. [cuts back to SpongeBob's house]
Gary: [angry] Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible. I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What's that, Gary?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night? Mr. Snail, could you please describe this... this marauder to the sketch artist?
Gary: Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
Patrick: I can't believe it! It was Squidward! [shows drawing of Squidward eating a Krabby Patty. Cuts to them in front of Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Open up in there, Tentacles! We know you're in there! We just want to ask you a few... [to Patrick] He's not cooperating.
Patrick: You know what to do. [SpongeBob picks up Patrick, and uses him as a batting ram]
Squidward: And one, and... [screams]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! You thought you could hide your crimes.
Patrick: But we hear-ed what you've done.
Squidward: If I cared, I'd ask what this is about.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient! [scene cuts to what SpongeBob is explaining again] And we have an eyewitness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case.
Squidward: A case like this? [hands SpongeBob a black suitcase]
SpongeBob: Yes! Because you can't make Krabby Patties without... [both gasp] tap dancing shoes?
Squidward: That's right! I was in a tap contest on the night in question. As you can see from my third place medallion.
SpongeBob: [nervously] I guess this means you didn't steal the secret ingredient. [Squidward snatches the briefcase from SpongeBob and walks outside]
Squidward: Get out of my house! [Squidward picks up his house, then moves it away from them, then walks inside. Cuts to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you were in charge of guarding that secret ingredient with your life!
SpongeBob: I know, Mr. Krabs. It just slipped away from me somehow.
Mr. Krabs: Well, do you have any leads, or clues?
SpongeBob: All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he got it.
Mr. Krabs: That would be... you, SpongeBob! You stole me secret ingredient!
SpongeBob: [Shocked] Me?!
Mr. Krabs: That's right. And I know exactly how you carried out this little caper. [cuts to what Mr. Krabs is explaining] You obviously set up a decoy to take the delivery. Then when no one was looking, you swooped in, stole the secret ingredient, and spirited it away to the Chum Bucket, [cuts back to the Krusty Krab] where you sold it to Plankton to make a quick buck. [SpongeBob tries to talk, but Mr. Krabs stops him] Don't talk! You can tell it to the cops, 'cause I'm calling them right now! [policemen come out from hiding in a barrel]
Policeman: No need. We heard it all from this barrel.
Mr. Krabs: [In a Russian accent] Then arrest this thief, Officer! [points at him with the secret ingredient]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient?
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] Uh, what are you talking about, SpongeBob? I'm not holding any secret ingredient. [sees he's still holding it out, then hides it]
Policeman: Am I to understand that you stole the item in question?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I wouldn't call it stealing...
Policeman: And you were going to let someone else take the fall for this little caper?
Mr. Krabs: I can explain!
Policeman: Please do.
Mr. Krabs: It's simple, $1.99 is a lot to pay for the secret ingredient every time I get a delivery, so I s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s... took it to avoid paying, you know.
Policeman: I think Judge Trout will be very interested to hear this little story. [handcuffs him]
Mr. Krabs: [frantic and stupidly] What?! What'd I do? [cuts to the court house]
Judge: All rise. Eugene Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Your Honor?
Judge: As punishment for committing the crime of grand theft, I sentence you to give away Krabby Patties for free, all day tomorrow.
Mr. Krabs: Give away me patties for free?! [sobs] Oh, no! I couldn't bear the sight of that! [cuts to next day at the Krusty Krab, and Mr. Krabs strapped to a chair is screaming and wailing]
SpongeBob: Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties! [When SpongeBob gives away free Krabby Patties, the two policemen laugh as they hold Mr. Krabs still while he continues to scream and wail hysterically.]


[Episode starts with the Krusty Krab. Inside, it is dirty and covered in cobwebs. Squidward is seen covered in dust and cobwebs. He blows the dust off himself. SpongeBob dusts off a cobweb off a table with a feather duster. A spider comes down and makes a new web. SpongeBob dusts it off again, but the spider comes back and makes another one. Mr. Krabs is seen covered in dust against the wall. He sneezes the dust off.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah-ah-achoo! [sighs] 36 days without a customer.
Dave: [slowly crawls towards the Krusty Krab] So... hungry...
SpongeBob: Ah! Mr. Krabs, a customer!
Mr. Krabs: Ah! [Krabs squeals in delight, revealing a spider web growing in his mouth. A spider crawls all over it]
Dave: No food... 3 days...
Mr. Krabs: Hold on, me bucko! Food's on the way! [He is about to call into the kitchen, but then has a second thought] Uhh... You got money, right?
Dave: Yeah...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Bring this guy some grub before he keels over!
SpongeBob: [offers him food] Here you go, sir.
Dave: Oh. Krabby Patties, huh?
Mr. Krabs: Finest under the sea!
Dave: Yeah, yeah, sure. But where's the pizzazz?
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Dave: I mean look at this place. [the inside of the Krusty Krab is all old and worn out] I mean... what is the theme here? Underwater? It's boring. [He turns and crawls away] Foooood... water... atmosphere...
Mr. Krabs: Nobody goes to a restaurant for atmosphere. [runs to the door] They go for food! [he looks out the door as Fred and Tom see each other on the street]
Fred: Hey, Tom!
Tom: Fred! Hey, you wanna eat at the Krusty Krab?
Fred: Nah. Let's go to the Shell Shack. They've got a talking dog!
Tom: [runs off with Fred] Great! Say, what's a dog?
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] Money walking! I need to think up a gimmick like that to bring people back in here!
SpongeBob: [peeks through Mr. Krabs' eye stalks] I have an idea! [Mr. Krabs' eye stalks pull back together, chopping SpongeBob in half]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I've got an idea! [Cut to outside the Krusty Krab, where a marching band plays, and a crowd gathers around Mr. Krabs] ...And so ladies and gentlemen, be sure to buy plenty of Krabby Patties as I bury myself alive! [Everyone cheers and confetti shoots up from the ground as Mr. Krabs wields a shovel. He digs a hole, and then hops into it] No free refills. [scene cuts. Then, he pats the dirt in around him, leaving himself underground with no trace of him. Fred runs up to on top of where Krabs was buried]
Fred: Hey, everyone, listen! [the music stops] The talking dog at the Shell Shack is SINGING!!! Come on!
[He motions for everyone to follow, and they do, leaving Mr. Krabs alone, under the ground. Cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab, where it has been cleaned out]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: What am I going to do? If I don't find an idea, I'll go out of business!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: Why can't someone give me an idea?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs: [looks above] Great Neptune in Heaven, I need an idea!!!
[A divine light hits Krabs, and SpongeBob comes down, playing the harp and dressed like an angel]
Angel SpongeBob: [singing] Mr. KraaAAaaaAAAbbs! I haAave an ideeeaaaaAAaa!
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] What in the name of money are you waiting for, boy? Tell me!
SpongeBob: OK. Mr. Krabs, Prepare yourself. Don't bother sitting down, because you'll just stand up when you see this! [makes a Pretty Patty] Ta-da! [Shows Mr. Krabs a green Krabby Patty]
Mr. Krabs: Great Barrier Reef! That patty's spoiled!
[He knocks it off of the plate and onto the ground, where he burns it with a flame thrower. Once the fire is gone, SpongeBob appears in a fire-retardant suit]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Mr. Krabs, it's not tainted meat. It's painted meat [Fire once again overcomes him, and he emerges in regular clothing, with an artist's pallet in hand. On the palette, Krabby Patties lie in different colors] Pretty Patties! Available in 6 designer colors.
[short pause then Mr. Krabs laughs, and SpongeBob looks broken-heartedly at his own creation]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! Come look!
[Squidward walks up, smiling mockingly]
Mr. Krabs: [jokingly] Don't that look appetizing?
Squidward: Mmm, mmm!!! Good, sir!
[Both laughing]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Gimme an orange patty... with extra purple!
[Squidward laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What's next? [holds up a milkshake cup with sequins and encrusted into it] Sequin milkshakes?
Squidward: [holds up a French fry with a bow-tie on] Bow-tie French fries?
SpongeBob: [Welding with tears] No.
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs dance mockingly while Squidward chants "Pretty Patties! Pretty Patties!"]
SpongeBob: [Crying] Stop it! [SpongeBob becomes indignant] I know this is a good idea. I'll show you! I'll... I'll... I'll open my own restaurant! [He runs out of the Krusty Krab] You'll see!
[Squidward and Mr. Krabs look at each other, then they continue laughing. Cut to Conch Street]
SpongeBob: [angrily approaches an angry Patrick] Hey, Patrick, are you angry, too!?
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: What's the matter?
Patrick: I can't see my forehead. What's your problem?
SpongeBob: I have a good idea, and no one else thinks so.
Patrick: [no longer angry, and a cord appears from his shorts] Me too. [he pulls the cord, causing his shorts to inflate and lift into the air a few feet. Patrick is floating upside-down] Inflatable pants! What's your idea?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna open up a restaurant and sell Pretty Patties!
Patrick: [his shorts explode, leaving him with only a piece of his shorts covering his crotch] Forget my dumb idea, that's great!
[Cut to later, where SpongeBob has constructed a purple stand that says "Pretty Patties." Patrick is behind a second one to the left of SpongeBob that is brown and says "Pay Here"]
SpongeBob: Are you ready for the big rush, Patrick? [Patrick looks down and pulls up his purple-and-green trunks and gives SpongeBob the thumbs-up] Pretty soon those hungry customers will be lining up, because we are open. [He puts up an "Open" sign. Cut to him at the stand] I'm ready! [He is an adult with the same camera angling. He has glasses on, and brown hair. His pineapple begins to rot] I'm ready. [He is an old man with a long, gray beard. His pineapple wilts and dies] I'm ready... [His gravestone behind the stand says "R.I.P. I'M READY." There is a vacant spot where his pineapple previously was. SpongeBob wakes up at the stand and sees that that was a dream] Patrick! How long have we been standing here?!?
Patrick: [looks at the sloppily-drawn crayon marks on his wrist made to look like a watch] Uhh... I gotta draw a new battery for this! [scribbles on his wrist with a blue crayon]
SpongeBob: What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb. [cries]
Patrick: SpongeBob, sometimes, we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems.
SpongeBob: I'm scared.
Patrick: Then I'm going in for you! [climbs into SpongeBob's head through one of his pores. Then, SpongeBob inflates like a puffer fish]
Patrick: Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants! [flies out of SpongeBob and lands headfirst on the ground]
SpongeBob: Did you find anything?
Patrick: Huh?
Harold: [walks up to the stand] Hey, do you sell food here?
[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle, making Harold feel awkward]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties! [holds out a green Pretty Patty]
Harold: That thing's green! [starts laughing hysterically] Green! [laughs some more]
Patrick: [laughs as well, but doesn't laugh hard at all] Green. [SpongeBob cries]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs was right! What am I going to do with all these? [holds out the palette of Pretty Patties]
Harold: [Stops laughing] Hey, is that one purple? Purple is my favorite color! [He tries it] This isn't half bad! Hey, world! "Pretty Patties" is the best idea ever! [SpongeBob and Patrick are elated]
[Cut to Mr. Krabs in his office, eating popcorn and watching a movie, crying. A spider dangling from its web cries as well]
Rick's Wife: [On TV] Oh, Rick, how could you? Together we were one.
Rick: [On TV] That was before. But now, I'm splitting us up.
[Onscreen, an amoeba splits into two amoebas. All of a sudden, it turns to a Bikini Bottom News emergency broadcast. Johnny talks at a desk. Behind him is a bamboo screen showing a crowd of Bikini Bottom citizens cheering]
Johnny: We interrupt this program to bring you a special news announcement! This wild crowd behind me is screaming for Bikini Bottom's latest culinary sensation. Let's take a listen.
All: [Chanting] Pretty Patties! Pretty Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Pretty Patties? [The spider comes down and steal Mr. Krabs' popcorn]
Johnny: It's easy to see Pretty Patties are popular, but what is it about them that drives Bikini Bottom feeders wild?
Millie, Sadie [has hair], and Evelyn: [we see Millie, Sadie Rechid and Evelyn on screen, who hold out their purses to compare with the Pretty Patties] They match our purses!
Scottish Man: [with Scottish accent, kilt, and bagpipe] They remind me of home. [holds up a plaid Pretty Patty and Larry runs up]
Larry: Pretty Patties rule! [flexes his muscles]
Johnny: Mr. SquarePants, how do you explain all this success?
SpongeBob: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... I don't know.
Mr. Krabs: How can you make money with such a stupid idea?
Johnny: [the TV background has money falling] And how can you not make money with such a brilliant idea?
SpongeBob: [laughs] At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it... [Mr. Krabs' eyestalks inflate] ...shredding it... [Krabs' eyestalks inflate some more] ...and burning it! [Mr. Krabs's eyestalks burst and fly around like a balloon with a hole in it as he screams] But in the end, we decided just to give it all away.
[Patrick is at this stand that now has a bamboo "$" and says "FREE MONEY." He hands a filled paper sack to Nathiel]
Patrick: Come again, sir!
Nathiel: I'm getting back in line! [runs off]
Mr. Krabs: I don't believe it! [runs out of his office and across the dining area] I've got to see this for me self! [runs out the door and into Sandals]
Sandals: Hey Watch it, buddy. I don't care how much you want your Pretty Patty. You're gonna have to wait in line [shows Krabs the very long line] like the rest of us.
Mr. Krabs: I've never had a line.
[At SpongeBob's stand, the "Now Serving" sign flips to 46,853]
SpongeBob: Who's #46,853?
[An enormous amount of people surround them and they simultaneously declare themselves as #46,853. Mr. Krabs makes his way to the front of the line]
Mr. Krabs: [surprised] I never had 46,853 customers.
SpongeBob: [hands a Pretty Patty to an anchovy] Here you are, sir. Stay pretty. [he laughs] All right. [notices Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs is that you? Isn't this great, Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs smiles nervously] The Pretty Patties are a big hit.
Mr. Krabs: They sure are, boy. You're doing pretty well for yourself. I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: [gets an idea, then he smiles smugly] I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs? [demonstrates rubbing two pickles together] That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... Yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab's only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down. For old time's sake. [takes SpongeBob by the hand and starts to walk away, but SpongeBob's arm expands and he just stays in the same place]
SpongeBob: Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, lad. I'll watch the stand for ye. [SpongeBob retracts his arm]
SpongeBob: You will?
Mr. Krabs: No, I've got a better idea! I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands- for keeps! An in exchange, I'll give ya the Krusty Krab! With Squidward, the grill, and all those squeaky pickles!
SpongeBob: [In a trance] What did you say, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Here's the key to the Krusty Krab. [gives SpongeBob the key, which is composed of 2 K's and a ring] She's yours now.
SpongeBob: [receives the key, while still in a trance] Thank... you... what should I do now, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Run to her, boy. She's waiting for ya.
SpongeBob: I can't feel my legs, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, boy! I'll fix it! [grabs SpongeBob and tosses him to the crowd] Get this to the Krusty Krab on the double! Good luck, lad!
SpongeBob: [while crowd-surfing, SpongeBob's surroundings turn into a pink sky with clouds] Dreams do come true! [gets thrown to the ground]
[SpongeBob floats up and kisses the building. He cheers in the dining area, kiss the floor, throw buns up into the air in the kitchen, laugh over the phone in Mr. Krabs' office, and stand at the ordering boat, the whole Krusty Krab cleaned and refreshed. Cut back to the Pretty Patties stand]
Mr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen! "Pretty Patties" is now under new management! [holds a green Pretty Patty] Who's next? [the crowd cheers]
[A sea-level shot of the Bikini Atoll Island. It turns from night to dawn and the rooster crows everyone up. Cut to Mr. Krabs at the stand beside SpongeBob's house. The "Free Money" stand has been disassembled]
Mr. Krabs: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready...For me money. [the crowd gathers around him, all looking angry] Welcome to Pretty Patties. May I take your money?
Franco: [high-pitched voice] We want a refund, Krabs. [crowd yelling in agreement]
Mr. Krabs: [confused and scared as he turns his head three times] Who, huh, What?
Gus: Your dumb Pretty Patties turned my [shows his purple face] face purple!
Scottish Man: [Scottish accent] Look what I got under my kilt! [raises his kilt to reveal a plaid body, and white underwear]
Clay, John, and Frank: And look at our tongues! [they show Mr. Krabs their respective tongues: a yellow tongue, a speckled tongue, and a normal-looking pink tongue]
Mr. Krabs: [confused as he refers to Frank's tongue while sweating] What's wrong with you?
Frank: [turns off a light to reveal his tongue is glow-in-the-dark, and is pulsing green] We want our money back. All 46,853 of us. [turns the light back on, but Mr. Krabs is nowhere to be seen]
Harold: Hey, where'd he go?
[Cut to Mr. Krabs screaming and running away]
Crowd: Get him! [crowd yelling, chases Krabs, with a rainbow trailing behind them]
Mr. Krabs: [panting...]" Oof! "[slams on the Krusty Krab door but it's locked] My key! [checks his pocket for the key but it's not there] Where's my key?! [recalls he gave it to SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [he quickly bangs the door to get SpongeBob's attention] SpongeBob, let me in! [inside the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is too busy happily rubbing the two pickles together, making a squeaking sound] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [Mr. Krabs tries to get SpongeBob's attention from outside] SpongeBob! Let me in! [SpongeBob cannot hear due to his pickle-squeaking. Krabs screams as he is chased left and right by the mob, still vainly yelling for SpongeBob's attention. Crowd yelling] SpongeBob!


[Episode starts at the Discount Grocery Mart, Mr. Krabs places a basket of items on the counter and Debbie scans them.]
Debbie: Price check on industrial size econo pack of raw fiber.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, it goes in like steel wool, but comes out like an angel from heaven.
Debbie: [sarcastically] Please, tell me more.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, well, this one time I...
Debbie: Not really!
Mr. Krabs: I didn't think so. Ooh, wait, I almost forgot me coupons! [hands her a lot of coupons] There's a couple double ones in there, too.
Debbie: Sir, these expired over 30 years ago.
Mr. Krabs: What does that mean?
Debbie: It means they're no good, sir. I'll just throw those away for you.
Mr. Krabs: No, wait! I'll take 'em.
Debbie: Okay, sir, your change today is going to be exactly ten cents.
Mr. Krabs: Come to papa! Come to papa! [two nickels slide out] Yay! Two nickels. [laughs, then gasps as he notices SpongeBob walking on the street] Hey, that's SpongeBob out there! [SpongeBob does some weird things] What in blue blazes is that boy up to? [SpongeBob points to something that appears to be a penny. Two fish passing by look at him. SpongeBob picks it up and puts it in his pocket] Well, I'll be a geriatric jellyfish! SpongeBob found a penny! A bright shiny penny just sitting there, and he picked it right up! Huh, I can remember the whole thing as if it just happened a moment ago. [Mr. Krabs imagines what just happened]
SpongeBob: [in the thought bubble] Sir... Sir! [it is actually Debbie]
Debbie: ...Sir! [thought bubble disappears]
Mr. Krabs: What?
Debbie: You're holding up the line.
Mr. Krabs: [a long line of angry fish is shown] Ooh, I am? [he leaves]
Debbie: Next, please. [cuts to night where Mr. Krabs is driving his boat]
Mr. Krabs: Interesting how things work out that way. Some folks just walk along and stumble over free money, while others, others, they work! [zooms out seeing that there's another car next to his and hearing dolphin chirps from Mr. Krabs]
Billy: Hey, mommy, look at that weird guy in the car over there.
Billy's Mom: Billy, mommy's watching the road right now.
Mr. Krabs: I mean, why couldn't I have just walked along and found it? I have legs, too, you know! [sighs] How about a little music. [music dial turns into a penny] Okay, okay, get a grip, Krabs. Just concentrate on driving. [steering wheel turns into a penny. Mr. Krabs screams and lets go of it, then holds it again] Okay, getting all worked up over a little coin. [laughs] Ah, it must just be the full moon. Wait a second. [the moon turns into a penny, and Mr. Krabs screams] I GOTTA, HAVE THAT, PENNYYYYYYYY!!! [cuts to next day at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob walks in] Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good morning, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Find anything special lately?
SpongeBob: Yae-yes!
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: Yup!
Mr. Krabs: And you want to share it with your old uncle Krabs, don't you, boy?
SpongeBob: Of course!
Mr. Krabs: Great! Well, share it with me!
SpongeBob: [laughs] I already am sharing it with you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Wha.. What?
SpongeBob: The thing I found was a bright, shiny, new... day! Well, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me. [talking to Squidward] Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: Don't talk to me.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs seems to be in a good mood today.
Squidward: That counts as talking. [SpongeBob walks into the kitchen, and Mr. Krabs is in there]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Hello again, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What can I do you for?
Mr. Krabs: Can I borrow a penny?
SpongeBob: A penny? Sure. [checks his pocket] Hmm, sorry. All out of pennies right now.
Mr. Krabs: But did you check all your pockets?
SpongeBob: Well, I thought I did.
Mr. Krabs: Front pockets? [SpongeBob checks]
SpongeBob: Hmm, no.
Mr. Krabs: Back? [SpongeBob checks]
SpongeBob: Hmm-mm.
Mr. Krabs: Shirt pockets? [SpongeBob checks]
SpongeBob: Nuh-uh.
Mr. Krabs: Shoe pockets?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Shoe pockets. Oh, Mr. Krabs, that is just ridiculous.
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: Well, I do have a tie pocket though. [SpongeBob checks] No, not in there either.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, maybe it fell in your sock.
SpongeBob: Well, I...
Mr. Krabs: Did you check there? [holds SpongeBob upside down, and shakes him, SpongeBob's brain falls out] Uhh?
SpongeBob: Hey, look, it's my brain! [brain grows legs and walks away] Hey, where's it going? [brain walks through a crack] Ooh, there. [brain crawls on Squidward, and SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs follow it, they find it under a barrel] Aha! [brain squirts liquid at him] Ugh! [SpongeBob laughs. He grabs his brain] Not so fast, little guy. There now. Yes, I know. Come here. [brain crawls back into SpongeBob's head]
Mr. Krabs: Uhh?
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Mr. Krabs? Didn't you know I was a brain whisperer?
Mr. Krabs: So, uhh, no penny, huh?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Darn! [cuts to later when SpongeBob is mopping, and hears a noise]
SpongeBob: Squidward, these deafening construction sounds are preventing me from working.
Squidward: Me, too.
SpongeBob: Do you think we should walk out back to investigate?
Squidward: Never. [SpongeBob and Squidward are now walking out back]
SpongeBob: The sounds are coming from back here. What the? [a movie theater is being built]
Mr. Krabs: Careful with those marquee ladders!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, you made your own movie theater!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, I did.
SpongeBob: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: And you're just in time for the grand opening! [pulls a lever that turns on the electricity on. Removes his construction hat and wears a magician hat] Step right up, folks, and witness a spellbinding tale chock full of adventure, and action, and thrills... [Mr. Krabs is chirping like a dolphin as two fish walk up]
Frank: You know, I'm not really hungry.
Fred: Yeah, let's go see what this fat guy is yelling about.
Mr. Krabs: ...witness the terrifying challenges overcome by... by...
Fred: By who?
Mr. Krabs: by a... by a plucky young sponge.
SpongeBob: Just like me!
Mr. Krabs: That's right! And the best part is: admission is only one penny!
Squidward: Does a movie like that even exist?
Fred: Yeah, does it?!
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, well, actually, I was going to show you this flip book and...
Squidward: A flip book?
Fred: Yeah, I don't even know what that is! [everyone angrily walks away]
Mr. Krabs: No, wait. Noooooooo!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, can I see the movie now? Please?
Mr. Krabs: Of course you can, lad! [SpongeBob smiles] You just gotta give me one penny.
SpongeBob: But, but...
Mr. Krabs: But what?
SpongeBob: But, I really don't have a penny. [Mr. Krabs screams, his eye twitches, then he drives a crane with a wrecking ball to demolish the theater. SpongeBob runs off. After demolishing the theater, a puff of smoke flies to Mr. Krabs and pops at his face. Cuts to night where SpongeBob is walking to the Krusty Krab] Huh, that's too bad. I really wanted to see that movie. [enters the Krusty Krab] Oh, well. [Squidward is dressed like a waiter]
Squidward: Good evening, [SpongeBob whistles] and [Squidward looks at a piece of paper] welcome to the [looks at paper] Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night.
SpongeBob: Squidward? You look beautiful!
Squidward: Let me show you to your table.
SpongeBob: My table? Fancy. [gasps] My very own name tag! [lights turn off and Squidward sighs, as he shines a flash light on Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, and welcome to a very important evening. Tonight's event is entitled: Pennies, for the penny-less. And before the following images are shown, I would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart. [Mr. Krabs shows some images] Three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. And since I realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, I am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty: You can donate one penny to me: Mr. Krabs. Also known as: Mr. Krabs, the man who doesn't have one. [Mr. Krabs starts crying and SpongeBob is crying, too]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [cheered up] Yes?
SpongeBob: I would like to donate a penny.
Mr. Krabs: You would?
SpongeBob: If I only had one! [SpongeBob starts crying, Mr. Krabs' eyes go into his head, and he screams. The scene then cuts to SpongeBob's house, Mr. Krabs is using a flower delivery truck to spy on his house, he is speaking gibberish, he notices SpongeBob walking out the door, he walks in, with a metal detector, and then Mr. Krabs looks around]
Mr. Krabs: Hiding it, somewhere. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it.
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: What's that? You! You know where!
Gary: Meow. [Mr. Krabs picks him up]
Mr. Krabs: Tell where!
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: Hiding it, inside, [reaches into Gary's shell] in there, somewhere. [lights come on, and SpongeBob walks in holding a drink]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks. [gasps] And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: It wasn't?
SpongeBob: No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint.
Mr. Krabs: Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I fell so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that. [Gary sniffs it, then blows a raspberry at it, and slithers away, the gum then absorbs the spit] Hey, this isn't gum at all. [pulls it out, revealing that it is a $500 bill] It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed up gum collection. Ah, well, good night, Gary. 
[turns off the light, then zooms out revealing that Mr. Krabs is digging holes outside of his house looking for the penny]
Mr. Krabs: Penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging.


[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Backing up! [Walks backward, face to the ground] Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop...
Squidward: You're better off not knowing.
SpongeBob: ...boop, boop, boop! [Flips over and puts a tray on a customer's table] Your Krabby Patty, sir.
Harold: Do you always serve your food this way?
SpongeBob: You mean with a smile? Yes, sir! [Patrick walks in on a pretend horse]
Patrick: Beware! Let it be known to all far and wide, The mollusks are coming! Tally, ho! [Rides around the Krusty Krab] The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming!
SpongeBob: Not the mollusks!
Patrick: Mollusks? What mollusks?
SpongeBob: There aren't any mollusks coming, are there, Patrick?
Patrick: No. I was only pretending to be my famous, Great-Great-Great Uncle, Patrick Revere! He rode through the streets warning Bikini Bottom of the coming hordes of ravenous, man-eating mollusks! [A flashback begins with Patrick's Great-Great-Great Uncle riding through town]
Patrick Revere: The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming!
Patrick: It's too bad nobody listened to him.
Fish #2: What beeth the deal with ye olde nutcase? [Mollusks come in. Fish #2 and #3 scream. Flashback ends]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick. I didn't know you had a famous relative.
Patrick: Well the best part about it is, I don't have to accomplish anything in life, because my Uncle already did it for me. Really takes the old pressure off.
Mr. Krabs: That's nothing! My Great-Great Grandpappy Krabs invented the greatest thing since loose change! The spendthrift billfold system! Allow me to demonstrate. [Pulls out what looks like a dollar in a wallet] Hey SpongeBob, how about a raise?
SpongeBob: Gee, thanks, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: A-a-ah, watch. [Pulls on the dollar, a steel jaw trap grabs Mr. Krabs' finger] See?
SpongeBob: Doesn't that hurt?
Mr. Krabs: Every time!
SpongeBob: Gosh, I don't have anyone famous in my family.
Patrick: Oh, well then it's lucky you have me as a famous friend. Or your life would be a hollow shell. [Scene cuts to when SpongeBob is standing by a statue that looks like someone riding a seahorse, covered in jellyfish poop]
SpongeBob: I'll bet you're someone's famous poop-covered ancestor. [sighs] I never realized how sad and empty my life was, until my friends pointed it out. [Sandy jumps in]
Sandy: HI-YAH!
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy. [Sandy sees SpongeBob upset]
Sandy: Something wrong, SpongeBob? You look sadder than a bullfrog full of sody-pop.
SpongeBob: Do you have any famous relatives, Sandy?
Sandy: I sure do! My great aunt Rosie Cheeks was the first squirrel to discover oil. At Spindletop, Texas. [Flashback begins with a squirrel standing on top of an oil tower]
Voice: She's ready to blow! [Oil spurts out of the ground, the squirrel jumps away, flashback ends]
SpongeBob: Seems like everybody in town has a famous relative. Everybody except me.
Sandy: Come on, I'll bet y'all got someone famous in your family tree.
SpongeBob: Well, there was my uncle Sherm. [Pulls out a wallet full of pictures] He could stick an entire watermelon up his nose. [Shows a picture of Uncle Sherm with a watermelon in his nose]
Sandy: That's not the kind of famous I mean. Come on. Let's do a little digging around your family tree. [Cut to Bikini Bottom Library, Sandy pulls out a book]
Sandy: "Family Histories of Bikini Bottom". Let's see, SquareHead, SquareShirt, SquarePants, Hey, looky here! [Points to a statue of SpongeBuck in a picture]
SpongeBob: Gasp!
Sandy: It's a statue of SpongeBuck SquarePants!
SpongeBob: I've never even heard of him! He got his own statue?
Sandy: Says here he saved the entire town of Dead Eye Gulch, that's what Bikini Bottom was known as back in the old west days. [Story Begins, train coming into scene] It was a town that lived under the tyranny of a nasty crook 'til a mysterious stranger came to town. [Train stops, SpongeBuck gets off]
SpongeBuck: Wow! The big city! Well, time to make my fortune.
Sandy: Back in them days, the whole place was run by that no-good galoot, Dead Eye!
SpongeBuck: Shoo-Wee! This place sure is big and fancy-like! Gee, willigers! They got an ice cream parlor! [Sees a building that says "Dead Eye Funeral Parlor and Ice Cream Parlor", SpongeBuck walks up to the front] I'll take one scoop of vanilly ice cream, please.
Fish #4: You're new here, aren't you?
SpongeBuck: Yep. I just got off from the train.
Fish #4: You don't say. [Licks ice cream, Fish #4 measures SpongeBuck and makes a coffin for him, SpongeBuck notices that some people are looking at him, he looks at them, pull their hats down, keeps walking and licking, music is coming from the Krusty Kantina]
William Krabs: Business is good today! [SpongeBuck walks in, wearing a bell that is ringing, everyone stops]
SpongeBuck: Howdy do, y'all?
Hopalong Tentacles: Great, another hayseed.
William Krabs: [Whispering] Charge him double for his drinks.
SpongeBuck: Howdy, partner! [Sits down] Pardon, but is this stool taken?
Fish #5: Yeah. Some fancy dude just sat in it. [SpongeBuck looks at the stool and smiles]
Hopalong: What can I get you, stranger?
SpongeBuck: Give me a shot of milk.
Hopalong: Milk?
SpongeBuck: Two percent.
Hopalong: Think you can handle it?
SpongeBuck: I drink this stuff every day. Over the lips and through the gums, look out tapeworm, here it comes! Get ready Tapey. [Laughs and drinks the milk, milk spills into a place where a worm is living] Aah, [Falls off the stool] Oh, yeah! Smooth.
Hopalong: Right.
William Krabs: What brings you to Dead Eye Gulch, stranger?
Hopalong: Strange is right.
SpongeBuck: The name's SpongeBuck. I left home to make my way here in the big city. I'm here for the job. [Holds up a paper that says 'Sheriff Wanted']
William Krabs: Wonderful! You're hired. [Gives him a badge] Hey everybody! Meet our new sheriff! [Everyone cheers]
SpongeBuck: Sheriff? I'm not here for the sheriff job. I'm here for the fry cook job. [Holds up the same paper but points to an ad that says 'Fry cook wanted Low pay/No Benefits'] Back home, I'm known for my rootin-tootin, never-pootin chili. The spiciest chili west of the old west farm. [Krabs tries it and spits it out]
William Krabs: No offense, kid. But your chili tastes terrible.
SpongeBuck: In a good way?
William Krabs: No, in a terrible way. Look, we already gave you the badge. And the law of the west says: no take backs!
Hopalong: Since when?
William Krabs: Shshshshshsh! So that means, you're the new sheriff!
SpongeBuck: What happened to the old sheriff?
William Krabs: Uh, he's at Boot Hill. [Shows a picture of a cemetery with a sign saying Boot Hill]
SpongeBuck: Gasp! And, why is he at boot hill?
William Krabs: Because Old Dead Tree Hill was totally full. [Shows a picture of a full cemetery with a sign saying Old Dead Tree Hill, Pecos Patrick bursts in]
Pecos Patrick: He's a' coming! Dead Eye's a' coming!
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch: Dead Eye?!
William Krabs and Hopalong: Dead Eye?!
SpongeBuck: Who's Dead Eye?
Pecos Patrick: I'll tell you who Dead Eye is! But I shall do it through song. Maestro, if you please. [Hopalong is at the piano, cracks knuckles, about to play, deposits coin, music starts playing] ♪Oh, Bikini Gulch was a purdy place with sweet water and blue sky. 'Til one day a beast 'come a-riding from the east by the name of Ol' Dead Eye.♪
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch: ♪That dirty, no-good Dead Eye!♪
Pecos Patrick: ♪Oh, he's robbed this town, he's pulled my pants down!♪
Polene Puff: ♪He made all the pretty girls cry!♪
William Krabs: ♪That no-good goon wants my saloon! And me I.O.U's due tomorrow noon! If we don't get some help here real soon...♪
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch: ♪We'll lose everything we own to Dead Eye! We'd stop him if we weren't too scared to try!♪
Pecos Patrick: ♪And if you think that's funny, let me tell you, sonny, you won't be laughing when you SEE...♪ [Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch gasp] ♪HIS...♪ [Polene Puff gasps] ♪BIG...♪ [SpongeBuck gasps] ♪RED...♪ [Hopalong Tentacles and Western Mr. Krabs gasp] ♪DEAD EYE!♪
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch and SpongeBuck: ♪Dead Eye!♪
Dead Eye Plankton: That's me! Dead Eye Plankton!
Pecos Patrick: Who?...
Hopalong: We just sang a whole song about him!
Dead Eye Plankton: Well, what are you looking at?! [Everyone hides, Dead Eye knocks a chair with a person down, pulls off Pecos Patrick's clothes]
Pecos Patrick: Aw, again? [Dead Eye flings checkers pieces in the air and flings them at the milk glasses with his whip, Hopalong and Krabs duck]
Dead Eye Plankton: Get up you two! I'm here for my... money, Krabs [dips a coin in milk and bites on it] .
William Krabs: [Laughs nervously] What? How am I supposed to keep the deed to me saloon if you keep taking all me mortgage payments? I'm going broke, here! [Dead Eye bends the coin]
Dead Eye Plankton: That's the idea! [Laughs] I thought we were all clear on that.
William Krabs: Oh, yeah. [Hands Dead Eye a bag of money]
Dead Eye Plankton: I'll be back at high noon tomorrow for the deed!
SpongeBuck: Hey! That's not your money.
Dead Eye Plankton: WHO SAID THAT? [Krabs points at SpongeBuck, Everyone runs away] Well, last time I checked, this town was Dead Eye Gulch! Not Yokelburg! [Stops] then [Laughs] Yokelburg... [Laughs again] Who are you anyway?
SpongeBuck: I'm SpongeBuck, the new sheriff. Want some chili?
Dead Eye Plankton: Sheriff! [Knocks down SpongeBuck's chili] 'Round these parts we call them coffin jockeys!
SpongeBuck: Coffin jockeys!? [Runs over to Krabs] You didn't say anything about that!
Dead Eye Plankton: [Pulls out a pocket watch] That must be a new record for running off a sheriff.
SpongeBuck: [Is pretending to ride a horse, but is on a coffin] Hope I haven't missed the first post. Whoa, girl! [Coffin neighs like a horse]
Dead Eye Plankton: Where do you get these guys? [Krabs shrugs] All right, kid. I'm going to make it simple for you. I'm a villain, got it?
SpongeBuck: Uh huh.
Dead Eye Plankton: And this town ain't big enough for the both of us! Understand?
SpongeBuck: Yep.
Dead Eye Plankton: So, vamoose! Or we're going to have to settle this western-style at high noon, savvy?
SpongeBuck: Sounds great!
Dead Eye Plankton: You have no idea what I'm talking about?
SpongeBuck: Nope.
Dead Eye Plankton: (sighs) [Cracks whip at SpongeBuck, SpongeBuck runs away] And stay out! Hey, only three seconds off my record! [Everyone is looking at Dead Eye] What are you hayseeds looking at? [cracks whip, Everyone screams and runs away] Get out of here!
Fish #6: What's gonna happen to the town now, Pa?
Fish #7: I ain't your pa. [Both scream and run away]
Dead Eye Plankton: I love this town! [Laughs evilly. Cuts to the desert where SpongeBuck is riding the coffin like a horse]
SpongeBuck: Whoa, gal, whoa! Whoa! [Trips on a rock] Looks like the end of the trail. We're out of food, [shows his arm, with no hand] water, and lip balm! [Lip balm turns to dust, SpongeBuck's lips crack and break off] I'm sorry, old Paint! Guess I have to put you out your misery! So long, old friend! [Is about to saw coffin in half]
Cowbone #1: Hey, buddy, you better be careful. Heat does funny things to your head.
SpongeBuck: It does?
Cowbone #2: Oh, don't listen to that guy, kid! He's looney! [Both laugh, SpongeBuck laughs, Pecos Patrick laughs]
Pecos Patrick: Oh, hey SpongeBuck! Those guys are a barrel of laughs, huh? But lazy! Anyway, you've got to get back and save the town, sheriff!
SpongeBuck: I ain't no sheriff. Or fry cook or even coffin jockey, and I'm no match for Dead Eye Plankton! I'm nothing. [Pecos Patrick slaps him]
Pecos Patrick: Out west, a man gets right back up on his coffin and faces his problems with the help of his idiot sidekick friend! That's me! [Shows a badly drawn picture of Pecos Patrick] Duhhh... 
SpongeBuck: I don't know, [slaps him again] Ow! Okay, okay! I'll do it! Just stop hurtin' me! Besides, you're right! It's time I stepped up and looked him in the eye! So, I'll go back to Dead Eye Gulch, whip Plankton, and save the town at high noon!
Pecos Patrick: Hop on, buddy!
SpongeBuck: Thanks, idiot friend! But I don't know how we'll ever get back to Dead Eye Gulch by high noon.
Pecos Patrick: Don't worry. I got a short-cut. He-ya! [Starts riding coffin, rides over a cliff, both land on a cactus, both start flying toward Dead Eye Gulch, in Dead Eye Gulch, a carriage is riding around town]
Polene Puff: Why are we going so fast?
William Krabs: 'Cause without a sheriff, Dead Eye won't stop until he has the clothes off our backs! [Dead Eye is in the road]
Dead Eye Plankton: [Laughs evilly] Great idea! [Scene cuts to where Western Mr. Krabs, Polene Puff, and Hopalong have no clothes on but their underclothes] Okay, let's see, [checking off a list] personal possessions, clothes off your backs, that should about do it! Look, I'm just going to drop off all my new stuff at the bank. I'll be back at high noon to rub my victory in your face with a little dance. Uh huh, waa-waa! Uh huh, waa-waa!
Hopalong: I gotta admit, he's got skills.
Dead Eye Plankton: That's right! And when I take the deed to your saloon, Krabs, I'll own every building in town! And you'll all have to work for me the rest of your miserable lives! [laughs, but then coughs] Swallowed a bug! I hate that. It totally ruins an evil laugh. Yee-how! [Rides off]
William Krabs: So, that's it.
Polene Puff: We lost.
Hopalong: I don't know how it could get any worse. [SpongeBuck and Pecos Patrick start falling]
SpongeBuck: Hi, guys! I'm back in the nick of time!
Pecos Patrick: We're heroes!
Hopalong: You're morons!
Polene Puff: It's too late. Plankton's taken everything!
SpongeBuck: But it's only 11:55. The final showdown always takes place at high noon.
Polene Puff: Well, I guess the early bird gets the worm.
Hopalong: And all our stuff.
William Krabs: And me money! Me beautiful, beautiful money!
SpongeBuck: You can't give up! Before I came here, I would've given up, too. But in the short 20 minutes I've known you, I've come to love Dead Eye Gulch.
William Krabs: Could you get to the point? We're freezing!
SpongeBuck: What I'm a saying is if we all team up together, we can stand up to Dead Eye Plankton, and run him right out of Dead Eye Gulch for good! So, what do you say?
William Krabs: Well, I think we all know the answer.
All: Forget it, SpongeBuck!
Pecos Patrick: Why are you all standing in your pajamas? No, don't tell me. Oh, I know! You're throwing a slumber party! Pillow fight! [Whacks Hopalong with his pillow, laughs, then whacks SpongeBuck]
SpongeBuck: That pillow sure packs a wallop!
Pecos Patrick: It's made out of wood, [Pulls out a wooden log inside the pillow] like all pillows in the old west. Round 2?
SpongeBuck: I do believe I'd sit this one out.
Pecos Patrick: Looks like it's just you and me, kid. [Whacks himself with the log]
SpongeBuck: Come on, guys! We can do this! If we work together!
William Krabs: No offense, kid. But your advice is as terrible as your chili.
SpongeBuck: I don't blame you for losing faith. I lost faith too. But then, I discovered the love of my new idiot friend. And we've come far. So I'm sure with all of us working together, in idiot friendship, we can beat Dead Eye and save the town! So let's huddle up and make a plan, together! Bzbzbzbzbzb
Pecos Patrick: Uh huh,
SpongeBuck: Bzbzbzbzbzbzb
Pecos Patrick: Uh huh, uh huh,
SpongeBuck: Bzbzbzbzbzbzbzbzb
Hopalong: Uh, SpongeBuck, why do you keep saying bzbzbzbzbzbzb?
SpongeBuck: Umm...
Hopalong: You don't have a plan, do you?
SpongeBuck: No. To be honest, I didn't think I'd get this far. [Everyone groans] But I know we can beat him! If we just work together!
Dead Eye Plankton: Oh, I am terrified.
All: Dead Eye Plankton?!
Dead Eye Plankton: So, fry cook, you're back! And all alone.
SpongeBuck: You wish, Dead Eye! We are united! Right-- Hey! [All of SpongeBuck's friends are hiding at the Krusty Kantina]
William Krabs: We're right behind you, boy! WAY, WAY behind you!
Dead Eye Plankton: So, it's come to this. Mano y mano.
SpongeBuck: Well, you can hold the mano, because it's come down to you and me!
Dead Eye Plankton: Well, well, well, look at the time! High noon! [A clock strikes 12:00 P.M., Dead Eye and SpongeBuck walk toward each other ready to attack. SpongeBuck suddenly hears a squelching sound.] Ow! [SpongeBuck, confused, lifts his shoe, and underneath is Dead Eye, squished and sticking to his shoe. Everyone who's hiding looks at SpongeBuck, and they come out and cheers] I hate all of you!
William Krabs: Can I try?
Dead Eye Plankton: You can't do this! [Western Mr. Krabs joyfully steps on Dead Eye repeatedly]
Pecos Patrick: Three yee-haws for SpongeBuck!
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch: Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! [scene cuts to where Krabs is holding a line to squash Dead Eye at the Krusty Kantina]
Mr. Krabs: Step right up, folks! Just a dollar to stomp on old Dead Eye Plankton!
Dead Eye Plankton: [Polene Puff is smushing Dead Eye over and over again. The bottom of her shoe is covered in green stains] Ah! Ouch! Ooh!
Polene Puff: Take that, you no-good little varmint!
Dead Eye Plankton: I have a lot of money! [Gets smashed by her boot again, and she twists her foot, smearing him into the floor]
Pecos Patrick: Well, sheriff, you beat Dead Eye Plankton and saved the town. [SpongeBuck drinks a glass of milk, but Pecos Patrick spills his, both say Ahh]
SpongeBuck: You forgot the most important part.
Pecos Patrick:  What's that?
SpongeBuck: I discovered the power of idiot friendship. [Shows a badly drawn picture of them both going Duhhh...]
Pecos Patrick: Come with me, I want to show you something.
William Krabs: Thank you, sheriff SpongeBuck for saving our town. And for stepping on that little varmint.
Dead Eye Plankton: History will vindicate me! [Gets stepped on by Pecos Patrick]
William Krabs: We melted down Plankton's gold and made a statue in your honor. [Pulls off a sheet revealing a golden statue of SpongeBuck on a coffin]
Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch: Oooh!
Hopalong: I liked my design better. [Shows a piece of paper with his idea on it, but it is him]
William Krabs: Sorry about the whole “tricking you into being sheriff” thing. And to make it up to you, I've got a new badge for you. If you'll take it. [Puts the badge on SpongeBuck]
SpongeBuck: Wow! Fry cook! [Everyone starts clapping] Thank you, good people of Bikini Gulch! The statue is truly amazing! Maybe a little too heavy in the hindquarters, but still, if I ever have a Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson, I'd want him to look at this and say 'Hey! I'm proud of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather!'
Citizens of Bikini Gulch: Aaw!
Fish #8: Say seaweed! [Picture takes, story ends]
SpongeBob: So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch! And everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. [Sandy and SpongeBob walk out of the library] It was much better than that one we have now. [Both walk by the statue SpongeBob saw earlier]
Sandy: Yeah, and it's covered in jellyfish poop.
SpongeBob: Wait a minute, [Goes over and starts to pick at the jellyfish poop]
Sandy: Gross! Don't touch that, SpongeBob! Eeew! What are you doing?! [SpongeBob wipes the poop off the statue to reveal gold] That boy ain't hooked up right.
SpongeBob: Look, Sandy!
Sandy: HUH?! [The statue reveals to be the SpongeBuck statue, as Sandy realizes SpongeBob's reasons.]
SpongeBob: SpongeBuck was here all along! Sorry, Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. I didn't recognize you all covered in poop.
Sandy: [amazed] Wow!
SpongeBob: I've got a lot to live up to. Maybe one day people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants!
Sandy: Keep dreaming, SpongeBob. Keep dreaming. [The jellyfish float back to the golden statue. Scene cuts to the Krusty Kantina where SpongeBuck is on stage]
SpongeBuck: Hey, everybody! It's good to be here at the Krusty Kantina! We got a real special show for y'all tonight! Featuring my new best pal, this guy! [Pecos Patrick gets on stage,] He's an idiot! [Everyone cheers]
Pecos Patrick: So, what are we gonna sing about, SpongeBuck?
SpongeBuck: We're gonna sing a song about friends!
Pecos Patrick: What kind of friends, SpongeBuck?
SpongeBuck: Well, listen up and I'll tell you! ♪Who's there for you when you are sad and down?♪
Buffalo Skulls: ♪Idiot Friends!♪
Pecos Patrick: ♪Who picks you up and slaps you all around?♪
Clouds: ♪Idiot Friends!♪

SpongeBuck: ♪Who helps you pick your pants up off the ground?♪
Pecos Patrick: Thanks, buddy!
Dead Eye Plankton: Curses!
Pecos Patrick: Only an idiot friend would do that!
SpongeBuck: Let's bring it home, idiot friend!
Pecos Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBuck: ♪Who lets you ride on his coffin?♪
Pecos Patrick: ♪Who slaps you hard and often?♪
SpongeBuck: ♪What do you and me have in common?♪
SpongeBuck and Pecos Patrick: ♪We're idiot friends!♪ [Everyone Cheers]
SpongeBuck: Thank you, thank you very much.
Dead Eye Plankton: Help me!


[The episode begins when the postman posts letters for SpongeBob under his door]
SpongeBob: [excitedly] Oh, boy, the mail's here! [picks the letters up] What do we have today? [looks through the letters] Gas bill... taxes... letter to SpongeBob from - [notices return address] Grandma! [rips the letter open]
Grandma's voice: Dear SpongeBob, won't you come join me for my birthday? I'll be turning...even older this year! With love, Grandma.
SpongeBob: Oh, Grandma's turning even older! I can't wait to celebrate! [trips over Gary] Sorry, Gary, I am gonna miss you when I'm gone...but, if I'm not here, who's going to take care of you?
Squidward: [while watering his garden] Hmhmhmhm...
SpongeBob: [using a woman's voice] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [screams, then drops his watering can]
SpongeBob: [while covering his face with Gary, still using a woman's voice] My daddy is going away. Can you take care of me...eow? [takes Gary off his face, then laughs]
Squidward: Oh, no. No way! Look what that disgusting pest did to my sustainable kelp garden! [cuts to kelp garden, with only bits left] He chewed it up, ruined it!
SpongeBob: Gary, is that true?
Gary: [smiles and shows mouth full of kelp bits] Meow.
SpongeBob: Well, I'll see you later, Squidward. [leaves]
SpongeBob: [knocks on Patrick's rock] Patrick! [opens the rock, then Patrick sitting on the ground with a puddle of water beside him] Patrick?
Patrick: [mumbles softly]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm talking to my friend, Funny. [to a puddle] Hi, Funny!
SpongeBob: Heh, yeah. Hey, Patrick, I need to ask a favor of you.
Patrick: What is it?
SpongeBob: I need you to take care of Gary.
Patrick: Are you going off the grid?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: Don't worry, I know what I do. You're gonna need one of these. [takes out a bindle]
SpongeBob: No, that's not it! I am going to see my Grandma for her birthday, and I'm trusting my best pal to watch carefully over Gary when I'm gone.
Patrick: You got it. He's safe with me! [drops Gary on the ground]
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: [bubble transition to SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob is writing down on paper] Okay, Patrick. There you are!
Patrick: [while eating chips] What's that?
SpongeBob: It's a chronological list of all the things you need to do with Gary. Make sure you do each and every one.
Patrick: [takes the list and throws it away] Got it! Hey, do you have any more of those deep fried cream filled sugar-coated coral balls?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. They're in the cupboard.
Patrick: [opens up the cupboard to see a bag of coral balls] Ooh, coral balls.
SpongeBob: [sniffles sadly] [to Gary] I'm gonna miss you, little guy. But I know you are going to be in good hands.
Patrick: [chuckles] You can't get to my stomach now, white coral ball. [eats the coral ball]
SpongeBob: [to Gary] Okay, Gary. I'll be home by ten. [starts walking to the door, then stops, then turns to Patrick] Dear Patrick, just do verify. [counts using his fingers] First, you feed Gary, then you pet Gary, then you-
Patrick: [interrupts SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [walks up to SpongeBob] Don't you trust me? I am the most responsible guy you know!
SpongeBob: [shrugs his shoulders] You know what? You're right.
Patrick: Well, of course I am! [pushes SpongeBob out the door] Now, go see your Grandma. Gary's in good hands. [closes the door, then walks back up to Gary] Yep! Looks like it's just you and me, friend.
Gary: Meow.
Patrick: Hmmm... I wonder what we should do first. [takes the list written by SpongeBob, reading it upside down, then he scratches his head] You need to work on your handwriting, SpongeBob. I don't need this anyway. [crumples the list up, then throws it away] Oh! I know! Let's go for a walk! [takes out a leash]
Gary: [pants happily]
Patrick: [his stomach growls] Oh. Looks like my tummy is having an argument with the coral balls. Ohhh... [runs to a restroom]
Gary: [sighs] [scene changes to the outside of SpongeBob's pineapple, changing from sunset to night]
Patrick: [walks out of the restroom, then sighs] Better. [as he walks back in the kitchen, he sees Gary all dried up]
Gary: [weak voice] Meow.
Patrick: Oh, hey, friend! What's up?
Gary: [still in a weak voice] Meow. [as his stomach growls, he points to it using his tail, then he tries biting off the bag of snail food] Meow.
Patrick: Step aside, Barry. Let me show you how it's done. [picks up the bag, ravenously bites it off, then sniffs the inside of it] Ooh. Gotta try a bite of this. [eats all of what is inside the bag, with some of the food falling on Gary] Ahh. [burps] Good stuff.
Gary: [mumbles angrily]
Patrick: I wonder what SpongeBob's got for you in the fridge. [opens the refrigerator, looking for something for Gary]
[Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's Grandma's house...]
Grandma: [while wearing a birthday hat] I hope you saved room for dessert, SpongeBob. [brings out a cake]
SpongeBob: [while holding a fork and a knife, and also wearing a party hat] Oh, Grandma, you shouldn't have. It's your birthday, I should be serving you!
Grandma: Awww... I know how much you love sweets, and I know how much you love your pet snail, so I made you this special gelatin mold. [close-up of a gelatin cake with a gelatin Gary on top of it]
SpongeBob: Gary. Oh, Gary. [thinks to what Patrick said earlier in the day]
Patrick: He's safe with me. [drops Gary]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [stands up, worried] Grandma, can I please use your phone?
Grandma: Of course!
SpongeBob: Thank you. [rushes to the phone, then types in the number]
Patrick: [answers the phone] Hello?
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's SpongeBob. How's Gary?
Patrick: Oh, Gary! Yeah, he's fine.
Gary: [rolls up to Patrick] Meow. [his stomach growls, then Patrick laughs along with him]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Sounds like you got everything under control. Oh, and make sure to give Gary his bath. [hangs up, then sighs]
Patrick: [hangs up, puts Gary down, and sits on the couch, then smells Gary, and then puts his face away] Whew! SpongeBob was right. You need a bath! [while walking to the kitchen, Gary can smell his pungent pit odor, then Patrick turns the kitchen sink on, and water comes out] Oh! I almost forgot. [picks up the bag of snail food] Snail food!
Gary: [happily] Meow!
Patrick: [puts the snail food in the sink] Gotta get the water to stay in there somehow. [sees Gary trying to eat the snail food] Now, Gary, we don't eat the bath. We get in the bath. [the snail food sinks in the water] Come on, Gary. [a demonic Gary growls] Oh, don't be difficult now, Gary. [Gary tries to bite Patrick] Gary! [sees growling Gary on top of the refrigerator] There you are! [Gary jumps down the refrigerator, and runs out of the kitchen, then Patrick tries to chase him, but keeps slipping on Gary's slime trail until he hits the TV, landing on top of his head, then takes it off, and throws it away as the phone rings] Oh, what now? [answers the phone] SquarePants household.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick, about Gary's bath, make sure the bath water is not too hot, and he doesn't like too many bubbles.
Patrick: Yeah, yeah.
SpongeBob: And remember to dry him off really good.
Patrick: All right.
SpongeBob: And don't forget about the list!
Patrick: [angry] Okay, I get it, SpongeBob! I get it, I get it! [tries to throw the phone out of the window, but it comes back in, and hits Patrick in the head] No! [slides on Gary's slime trail up the stairs and flying straight into the bathtub/shower in SpongeBob's bathroom, then Patrick's head is covering the drain as he tries to get out by pulling the shower sprinkler, which breaks and water comes out, as one of Patrick's eyes is closed from the water] I don't get these new beguiled shower heads. [opens the door to call for Gary] [high-pitched] Gary! Time for your- [normal voice] [to himself] Wait a minute, Patrick! You gotta trick the snail! [points to himself using both hands] You gotta be smarterer than him! [walks up to Gary] Hey, buddy! I got something cool to show you. And it's the opposite of a wet watery bath. [puts on a welding mask] Take it down! [uses a flamethrower to burn down SpongeBob's bed]
Gary: [worried] Meow!
Patrick: Doesn't that look fun?
Gary: [still worried] [high-pitched] Meow! [runs out of SpongeBob's bedroom]
Patrick: Well, make up your mind! Is it water or fire? [turns on the fire blaster for a couple seconds, then Gary runs into SpongeBob's kitchen storage and jumps on one of the shelves as Patrick walks in, too, with a hose] Okay, Gary. If you don't come to the bath, then the bath's gonna come to you. [turns on the hose which sprays Gary] That's a good boy! Now, suds up! [close-up of a box of soap flakes that Patrick's holding] [Patrick pours it on the water as the soap flakes and water both aim at Gary, filling up the entire storage]
Gary: [in a bubbly voice] Meow!
Patrick: That wasn't so bad, now was it?
Gary: [a can falls on his belly] Oww!
Patrick: [walks up to Gary] Oh, now we gotta dry you off. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any salt. So, I'll have to use the next best thing! [uses a hair dryer to dry off Gary as Gary's eyes shatter a little, then Patrick puts a very dry and old-looking Gary on the table] There! Doesn't that feel better? Okay! [sits down on the couch] Let's see, Gary's eaten, he's had his bath, Time to watch the TV! [after seeing a broken TV for only a couple seconds, Patrick falls asleep as the broken shower stills fall water, crawling down the stairs, and also, water from the kitchen sink and from the hose is still running, too, then while Patrick's still sleeping, water fills up the living room floor, and just then, water comes down from upstairs, making the whole house flooded, then the table and couch where Gary and Patrick are both sitting on start to move as Patrick wakes up and sees Gary moving on water after coming back up from under it] Sheesh, Gary! Well, if you wanted another bath, why didn't you just ask?
Gary: [annoyed] Meow! [all the things in the living room, including Gary and Patrick, move, and Patrick evenly gets caught with the upstairs water]
[Meanwhile, back at SpongeBob's grandma's house...]
SpongeBob: [brings out Grandma's birthday cake with a bunch of candles, singing] ♪Happy Birthday dear old Grandma, Grandma, Grandma! The best Grandma in the world, Grandma, Grandma!♪ [puts the cake on the table]
Grandma: [close-up of all the candles on the cake] Oh, dear! Look at all those candles! Why, if I were any older, we'd be in danger of burning down the house!
SpongeBob: [thinks about his house being on fire, and Gary meows in the background] [worried] Grandma, can I use your phone again?
Grandma: Go ahead, dear. But there may not be any cake left when you get back! [takes a deep breath, then starts trying to blow all the candles out]
[the outside of SpongeBob's pineapple moves around in circles]
Patrick: [giggles as the phone rings, then answers the phone] SquareyPants' house.
SpongeBob: Just checking, is everything okay over there?
Patrick: [bored] Who is this?
SpongeBob: [smacks his forehead] It's SpongeBob. Is Gary all right?
Patrick: Oh, yeah. He's- [gets caught again from the upstairs water]
SpongeBob: [worried] He's what? He's what, Patrick? Gary is what?! [hears Gary and Patrick both laughing] What is happening to them?! [Patrick and Gary both laugh again after coming up from water] They need my help! [rushes back to the kitchen, where Grandma is still trying to blow all of the candles out] Grandma! Grandma!
Grandma: Hold on, dear. [pants] Just...just let me finish these last few candles. [again takes a deep breath and continues blowing, when all of a sudden, SpongeBob turns on a fan on top of them to blow all of the candles out, then Grandma sighs] I did it! [puts her hand on her forehead] Oh, but oh, am I tired!
SpongeBob: [as he carries Grandma to her bed] Ooh, better get you to bed now. Good night, Grandma! [in the background, he close the door]
Grandma: What a good boy!
SpongeBob: [running outside] Hang on, Gary! [when SpongeBob arrives at his house and opens the door, water comes out, and SpongeBob swims inside, then the water drains out] Gary! [hears Gary meow] What's the matter, buddy? [runs up the stairs, the sees Gary meowing at the book called "Snail Tales" while Patrick is laying on' SpongeBob's bed] Ahh... reading Patrick a bedtime story, I see. "Snail Tales," that's a good one.
Patrick: [sits up on the bed] "Snail Tales"? I thought it was called, "Meow, meow, meow."


Patrick: Okay, SpongeBob! It's your turn! I'm ready!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick! Here I come! [runs and leaps over Patrick]
Patrick: Nice landing! [rolls, leaps and lands on his head and hands] Darn, I missed! SpongeBob, look out for my body! [They both fall off a mountain and land on a nest.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking.
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here!
Patrick: Ball! Let me see it! [a ball turns itself into a worm] What a weird ball.
SpongeBob: Well, who knows how long it... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!
Patrick: There's nothing to be afraid of, SpongeBob. It's just a little worm. See?
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest, little worm. I promise it won't happen again. [the worm rubs its head on SpongeBob's hand] Look, Patrick!
Patrick: Looks like he's taking a fancy to you.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back.
Patrick: That sounds delightful! [cuts to scene where SpongeBob and Patrick arrive at SpongeBob's place.]
SpongeBob: Gary! [knocks the door] Make yourself descent. [laughs] You have a visitor. [Gary went to sleep, then wakes up.] Gary, wake up. [opens the door, whispered] That's right, just bring in here. Careful, careful now. That's right.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley. [shows Mr. Wormsely, then Gary hissed at him and Mr. Wormsley barks at him, they start to growl at each other.]
Patrick: Something tells me they don't like each other.
SpongeBob: Come on, now. Guys, come on. Let's touch soft spots in a friendly manner. See? You're just saying hi. That's right. There you go, that's it. Oh, I knew you could get along. There, there you go. See? Friends. [Gary attacks SpongeBob.] Oh, my goodness! Patrick, oh! Oh, Patrick, please do something! [screams]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob, I gotta get going. See you later now.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, see you later then. [SpongeBob resumes screaming]
[Cut to the scene tonight]
SpongeBob: All right, Gary, just so there isn't more upset, I'm gonna ask that you sleep on the guest newspaper tonight, and Mr. Wormsley is going to be sleeping in here with me. [Gary growls at Mr. Wormsely. SpongeBob picks him up.] Now, now, Gary, there's no need for protest. [SpongeBob opens the door. And turns on the lights.] See? I set it all nice just for you. There you are. [SpongeBob leaves.] Night, Gare. [SpongeBob closes the door.]
Gary: Meow.
[Cut to the scene next morning.]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is seen sleeping. Waking up because of some howling.] Oh, sounds like Patrick is having one of his night fits again. I'll just close the window.  [Still hears some howling.] Mr. Wormsley! [SpongeBob takes off the newspaper revealing him mourning, and a big belly, meaning he's giving birth.] Whoa! I'm gonna go get help. Whatever's wrong with you, don't move! Just, uh, read the sports section or something.
[Cut to the scene later with Patrick.]
SpongeBob: He's in here. [Patrick enters the door.] Oh! I can't watch!
Patrick: SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob: Yes?
Patrick: Something tells me that Mr. Wormsley is actually a Mrs. Wormsley. [shows baby worms]
SpongeBob: Oh! Patrick, it’s a miracle.
Patrick: That it is.
SpongeBob: Wait till Gary sees.
Patrick: Yeah! Wait till...
SpongeBob: See, Gare? Right in here. They're gone asleep.
[Mrs. Wormley and Gary are growling at each other again.]
Patrick: Looks like they still aren't quite used to each other.
SpongeBob: Well, these things take time.
[Gary and Mrs. Wormsley get into a fight.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Duck and cover! [hide behind the bed]
Patrick: This town is getting too rough for me.
[Until outside of conch street.]
Gary: Meow, meow, meow.
[Mrs. Wormsley is now riding a bus.]
SpongeBob: He's chased her away! Now who will care for her abandoned litter of adorable newborn infants?
Patrick: Well, maybe you could take care of them.
SpongeBob: I dunno, Patrick. I've never seen Gary that upset.
Patrick: Ga...who?
SpongeBob: Nope, you and I are just gonna have to find loving homes for each and every one of these little guys. Right, Patrick? [door slams] Patrick? [Patrick is gone. Cut to SpongeBob at Squidward's house] Don't worry, little guys. Squidward is a really good friend of mine, and he really likes pets.
Squidward: [opens door, yawning] SpongeBob, what are you doing here? Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning?
SpongeBob:  Squidward, I came over with a very special surprise.
Squidward: Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the morning?
SpongeBob: How would you like to have your very own pet baby worms?
Squidward: Don't you know that it's 7:00 in the—baby what?
SpongeBob: Baby worms. See? Aren't they just adorable at that age?
Squidward: [glances into the box holding the worms] [one oozes green glistening slime on Squidward's face]
SpongeBob: So, how many did you want? [Squidward shuts the door in SpongeBob's face] [cuts to Mrs Puff's house]
Mrs. Puff: Yes? Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. What are you, uh, doing here? And not that the teacher's most enthusiastic student isn't welcome in her house. [notices SpongeBob still ringing the doorbell and sighs. SpongeBob looks down at the ground and finally lets go of the doorbell.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: It almost was.
SpongeBob: Would you like a baby worm?
Mrs. Puff: A what? [screams. Inflates her body to break some of her house in pieces]
SpongeBob: Uh, I'll just come back later, Mrs. Puff. Have a nice day!
Mrs. Puff: [house collapses] I hate Mondays.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, little worms. I know a place where we can find go to find homes for every single one of you. [cuts to supermarket] Good morning, ma'am. How are you today? Could I interest you in some... [lady just keeps walking] Ma'am? [Larry comes out of the Supermarket whistling] That whistling. It's Larry Lobster! Hi, Larry, what are you up to?
Larry: Do I know you?
SpongeBob: Probably not.
Larry: I was just picking up some dietary supplements here at the supermarket. I've been working on my chest... and buns.
SpongeBob: So I see.
Larry: Well, catch you later.
SpongeBob: Oh, Larry, wait.
Larry: No time now. Somewhere, there's sand that needs kicking.
SpongeBob: Okay. I was just gonna see if you wanted one of these poor, lonely baby worms.
Larry: Baby worms?
SpongeBob: Well, yeah!
Larry: I'll take them off your hands.
SpongeBob: Really?
Larry: Sure, why not? That's just what the nutritionist ordered: raw protein! [is about to eat the worms]
SpongeBob: Larry, no! [jumps into Larry's stomach, knocking him down and sending the box flying]
Larry: Dude, nice hustle.
[The box lands in the middle of an intersection, with an 18-wheeler headed straight for it. SpongeBob lets out a bloodcurdling scream, flails his arms and babbles incoherently. Larry launches SpongeBob into the air with his abs and he lands on the hood of the truck. He slides down, pulls the vent apart, and crawls inside. He pulls out three plugs, then peeks outside. The truck is still going. Then he notices a loose screw. He unscrews it completely with a wrench, causing the engine to fall out of the bottom of the truck and the truck to stop completely, in the nick of time.]
SpongeBob: Oh, little wormies, I'm so glad you're safe. Now let's go see about finding you those homes I promised. [the phone rings] Hello?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, it's Mr. Krabs. I've been looking all over for you. You're three hours late for work! [SpongeBob screams] Hello?
SpongeBob: [runs into the Krusty Krab out of breath] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I came as fast as I could--
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you sure you're feeling shipshape?
SpongeBob: [pants] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. My pet worm had babies and got chased away. Now I've got to find them all a place to live.
Mr. Krabs: Babies?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Let me see.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, come on, let me see them. I like babies.
SpongeBob: Well, okay.
Mr. Krabs: [in baby talk] Hey there, little critters. [looks inside the box] Come to... [one of the worms spits green bile onto his face]
SpongeBob: Oh, he likes you.
Mr. Krabs: [very angry] Get that disgusting vermin out of me restaurant, pronto! [SpongeBob is shocked by this reaction, and runs out of the Krusty Krab sobbing] Blech! [bubble transition to the back of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [inside a garbage can with the worms, depressed] Oh, well. At least I still have you guys. [gets sprayed on by the worms as a garbage truck drives up and stops]
Garbage Fish #1: Hmm... [removes some goo from SpongeBob's face with two fingers and sniffs it]
Garbage Fish #2: What is it?
Garbage Fish #1: I'd recognize this goo anywhere. It comes from a baby spotted glistening meadow worm, the rarest of its species.
Garbage Fish #2: Dude, those things are worth a fortune.
Mr. Krabs: Did you say "fortune?" [His eyes show dollar symbols] [later, Mr. Krabs is talking through a megaphone and trying to sell worms] $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks.
Female fish: These things are so cute! [hands some money to Mr. Krabs and receives back a worm]
SpongeBob: Enjoy your new home, little guy.
Female fish: Isn't he just adorable? [gets sprayed on by her new baby worm. She laughs, the crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: That sure was a great idea you had, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad.
SpongeBob: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. I've never been to the old country! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs both laugh, ending the episode]


Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Clay: Hmmm... uhh... oh, I'll have a... [Squidward takes out a pencil and a paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Maybe... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and  the paper away] Hmmm... I'll have... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. Or maybe...
Squidward: Are you planning on ordering today, sir?
Clay: I'll have a Krabby Patty. [Squidward writes down order]
Squidward: How original.
Clay: And with extra onions.
Squidward: Daring today, aren't we? [takes order and shows SpongeBob] One Krabby Patty, extra onions. [SpongeBob takes piece of paper and puts with the rest of the orders]
SpongeBob: One cryin' Johnny comin' up! [cracks knuckles; adds each ingredient as mentioned] First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! [bell rings]
Squidward: Whatever. [John comes up and tells Squidward what he wants and Squidward relays order to SpongeBob] Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! [SpongeBob takes a plate and patties begin to appear on the plate]
SpongeBob: [at rapid speed] Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! [Squidward takes the plate]
Squidward: Thanks, Farmer Brown. [gives the plate to John] It's been a thrill serving you.
John: Can I get some extra salt?
Squidward: We're all out.
John: Could you check?
Squidward: No. [John glares at Squidward as he leaves. Bubble Bass walks up to order] Let me guess, tiny, a small salad?
Bubble Bass: I'll take a Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim. [Squidward gives up writing all of that down]
Squidward: We serve food here, sir. [SpongeBob shows Squidward he has already gotten the order done]
SpongeBob: I got it already, Squidward. [gasps] Bubble Bass!
Bubble Bass: [pushes Squidward away] SquarePants! [walks to SpongeBob] I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [staring at Bubble Bass] Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
Bubble Bass: Yep.
SpongeBob: Well then... here ya go! [Bubble Bass takes the plate and sits down where he examines the Krabby Patty until he decides to take a bite] Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
Bubble Bass: This is pretty good. Only one thing. You forgot the pickles! [shows no pickles on the patty]
Crowd: [gasp]
SpongeBob: No!
Bubble Bass: The best there is? I don't think so. You lose! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [checks patty for pickles] But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! [customers are disappointed; tears the patty apart, finding the pickles] Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? [Bubble Bass walks up to Mr. Krabs, but also throws Squidward out of the way again]
Bubble Bass: I believe you owe me two bucks.
Mr. Krabs: Two bucks?!
Bubble Bass: Your guarantee. [points to the menu where in tiny print it says 'money-back guarantee']
Mr. Krabs: Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this? [takes out two dollars and Bubble Bass grabs it]
Bubble Bass: No.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls money back] How about a discount on restroom tokens? [Bubble Bass takes money back]
Bubble Bass: Afraid not.
Mr. Krabs: How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it! [Bubble Bass walks out the Krusty Krab with the money] No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No! [walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck! [SpongeBob tries to hang onto the floor]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait! [Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!
Squidward: I need a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right! [starts a new patty] Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No! [tries again] Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go? [tries again and uses the same bun] Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it! [tries again] Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no! [Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? What? [SpongeBob walks out and goes home]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... [looks up and notices door is not there] The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing! [Mr. Krabs opens door a couple feet away] Oh. [laughs] Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain. [walks out] Uhh, which way do I live? [Mr. Krabs points the path] Of course. [laughs. Later, we see SpongeBob in his house trying to write down the formula] No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe? [throws paper and pencil away] I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight. [at night]
SpongeBob: Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or... [hits his head with his fist] D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow. [gets in between the two mattresses] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Aw, this isn't right. [he slips out and stands upside-down on his bed] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Wait, this isn't right either. [SpongeBob lays down on his back] Nope. [SpongeBob is between each railing of the ladder] Nuh-uh. [tries sleeping with a mattress on his head] Negative. [tries sleeping on the ground next to his mattresses] C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. [tries in the lifesaver] Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet! [keeps doing the wrong things as the clock fast-forwards to morning and the rooster crows where the alarm goes off. SpongeBob is under all three mattresses on the floor] Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! [picks up Gary and shoves him in the foghorn alarm where it is still going off. At The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [there is black smoke coming from kitchen. Squidward clears the smoke off with a fire extinguisher] Patties are done. [Mr. Krabs notices black, burnt patties and gets irritated]
Mr. Krabs: Urrgh! [Turns backwards from the counter after hearing customers starting to complain]
Unknown Anchovy: Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty.
Martha: He burnt my fries!
Billy: [Briefly drinks his burnt shake until realizing it is burnt.] He burnt my shake!
All customers: [all yelling and mumbling]
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!
[cuts to SpongeBob's house, he nailed a toaster to the door]
Mr. Krabs: [opens door] SpongeBob?
[music playing in reverse; the house is a total disaster as everything is misplaced and things are everywhere and opposite.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [now he has underwear on his head] Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?
Mr. Krabs: Why you talkin' funny, lad? [takes the underwear off SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: I anything can't do right since because pickles.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
SpongeBob: I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: But you're fine, me boy! [SpongeBob walks right through the wooden kitchen door] Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not. [walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is nailing a piece of bread to the table] All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: I how do that?
Mr. Krabs: It's like riding a bike. You never forget! [notices a bike in a boiling pot of water on the stove] Uhh... I'm gonna help ya! [shown both of them sitting on the ground in SpongeBob's living room] If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. [takes out a blanket with all the ingredients on it]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...
Mr. Krabs: Take your time. [SpongeBob thinks of the Krabby Patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. [Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping until SpongeBob wakes him up] I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!
Mr. Krabs: Don't talk like that!
SpongeBob: Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! [Makes patty as he tells Mr. Krabs the ingredients] I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! [notices the Krabby Patty he just made, was in the correct order]
Mr. Krabs: It's time.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rescued Squidward from the burning kitchen and extinguishes him, too.]
Unnamed fish: Hey, SpongeBob's back! [men and women are cheering]
Bubble Bass: I hear SquarePants is back! [SpongeBob opens the kitchen door]
SpongeBob: I'm right here, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: I thought I ran you out of town. [spits a loogie into a bucket]
SpongeBob: This is where I belong! [holds up bubbles and blows one] .
Bubble Bass:  [Gives a weird sounding roar]
SpongeBob: Rawr.
[The crowd gasps. SpongeBob and Bubble Bass glare at each other, while Mr. Krabs is sweating with anticipation]
Bubble Bass: Give me the regular. And this time, don't forget the pickles.
SpongeBob: [rushes into the kitchen and comes back with a Krabby Patty in the blink of an eye] I didn't.
[Mr. Krabs is violently sweating as Bubble Bass examines and eats the patty]
Bubble Bass: Hmm... ...Still no pickles! [SpongeBob notices] See? [sticks out his tongue with all the chewed up food on it. Everyone is getting sick at the sight of it and they’re disgusted] You failed again, SpongeBob LoserPants! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [looks at Bubble Bass's mouth] Wait a minute! [grabs Bubble Bass' tongue and pulls it out] Look! [shows four pickles under Bubble Bass' tongue] He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
Mr. Krabs: And there's the pickles from last time, too!
Shubie: And there's my car keys! [everyone walks up to Bubble Bass, all glaring at him]
Bubble Bass: And... there's my ride! [runs out the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Whoop-de-doo.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward! [Squidward smiles] Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Squidward is shocked and frowns. The frown becomes more droopier with each "Boo"]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Scene changes to outside of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
Customer: Boo! You stink!


[Gary is snoring until the alarm horn blows. SpongeBob's blanket flies off but reveals a box for SpongeBob's body, a fork for the nose, and two potatoes for the feet.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Nice try, "alarmy," but you've got to get up pretty early to wake me up on "picture day!"
Gary: Meow. [crawls under SpongeBob's blanket]
SpongeBob: Now, if you'll excuse me, Gary, I must go make myself picturesque. [cut to SpongeBob putting a vacuum on his face then using a rolling pin to make his face shine. Then he gets some red and blue paint to paint the stripes on his socks. Next, he rolls on some paint for his pants and uses a white crayon for his teeth. He puts on a black wig and then he turns it into The Beatles' hairstyle, then a Jamaican hairstyle, and shaves it off] Perfect! I'm ready. Whoo-hoo!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [humming until a piece of seaweed lands on him; he then gasps loudly and peels it off, leaving a green residue on his clothes] Fine, fine, not to worry, no problem. [goes back to his house and repeats what he did earlier] I'm ready, again!
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: It's time to take a corrective approach. [grabs an umbrella and goes outside again] Good morning Squidward! I'd love to stop and chat right now, but it's Picture Day. Whoa! [gets grabbed by the claw of a garbage truck and dumped into the pile of garbage in the back of the truck. Umbrella opens more trash and Squidward laughs. SpongeBob spits out a trash bag and then cuts to SpongeBob changing again. This time, SpongeBob brings the trash bin to the garbage truck claw and then walks to school again]
SpongeBob: Still looking good, Spongy, and Boating School is just around the corner. [crowd is screaming and running away]
Harold: Take cover! The teenagers, they've been let out of school and they're pelting us with balloons filled with... [gets hit with a balloon that leaves a red pile of goo on his back; SpongeBob tastes it]
SpongeBob: Ketchup?
Harold: Save yourself, kid! [a fish runs by in the background, yelling in fear] I'm finished! [SpongeBob runs away while dodging all the balloons; he hides behind a dumpster but there is a kid waiting for him with a ketchup bottle]
Teenager: Gotcha!
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, don't squirt! Please, you've got to spare me. I've got picture day today.
Teenager: Oh, pictures, huh? Well, let me help you with your makeup, HAH! [squirts ketchup at SpongeBob but SpongeBob blocks ketchup with his tongue and jumps away; more teenagers run towards SpongeBob but he notices a hot dog stand and hides on the top where the giant hot dog is posing as a slice of cheese]
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not sure how I did it, but I... [gets squirted with ketchup by an old man who missed his hot dog]
Old Man: Fiddlesticks, missed again. [cut to SpongeBob changing again]
SpongeBob: And now, as an extra precaution to keep me looking shiny and new... [takes out small pink bottle labeled "Sponge Gloss" and puts some on his whole body.] No grime can penetrate the glossy sheen of... [the gloss starts to sparkle] Sponge Gloss. [sparkles; dodges everyone by hiding in all places, then he spots the Boating School] There it is. So close, and still so shiny. [the sun comes out and its beams reflect off the gloss and into a truck driver's eyes that causes him to crash and spill water on SpongeBob, making the gloss come off] Hey, it's just water. [a truck filled with stamps crashes and spills stamps all over SpongeBob] Aww! Stamps?! [he tries taking them off but a truck spills oatmeal all over SpongeBob] Oatmeal! [a truck filled with glue spills all over SpongeBob] Glue. [shows all the crashed trucks; cut to SpongeBob taking a shower and brushing all the stuff off him]
Patrick: Hey, buddy.
SpongeBob: Patrick, a little privacy here.
Patrick: Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I just came over to borrow some jelly.
SpongeBob: Well, go ahead, but I don't have time to play right now. I am late for picture day, and I just can't seem to get to school without being covered by unsightly debris. If only I had a sealed barrier to protect me from the filth of the outside world.
Patrick: I have a solution. [licks up all the jelly]
SpongeBob: Ew!
Patrick: Ah. I have solved my hunger problem.
SpongeBob: That's it! [jumps in the jar] This jelly jar will insulate me from the dirty dregs of Bikini Bottom. If you don't mind, Patrick, we don't have much time. [Patrick runs to the Boating School with SpongeBob still in the jar]
Patrick: We're here. Hey, what did I bring jelly for?
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick...
Patrick: Oh, yeah. I was gonna put it on this peanut butter taco.
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, Patrick! I'm not jelly, I'm not jelly! [is poured into the taco]
Patrick: Huh?! SpongeBob, get out of my taco! [SpongeBob stands up; the taco shell goes down his face; SpongeBob looks down to see that he is covered in peanut butter; he cries] What's the matter, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Patrick, I just wanted to take a decent picture today because someday, I will graduate from Boating School and I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells! [SpongeBob continues sniveling]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, there you are! [takes SpongeBob inside; Patrick licks his taco. Meanwhile, the photographer is taking another lady's picture]
Photographer: Say cheese. [takes the picture]
Mrs. Puff: And here's the last one. Now, just give a nice smile to the camera, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Wait, can I go home and change first?
Photographer: No time. Say cheese.
SpongeBob: [sobbing] Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese!
Photographer: Quit that moody brooding. This will clean you up. [takes a hose and sprays the peanut butter off with water] Don't snivel like that. A winner doesn't snivel. Try putting this on. [SpongeBob puts on a green outfit] This is it. Now you are looking like a winner. [SpongeBob cries when he looks at his outfit]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, please stop crying so he can take the picture.
Photographer: Do not worry, Mrs. Puff. I brought Pearlie.
SpongeBob: I can't stop crying!
Photographer: [opens up his briefcase that has a giant pair of dentures in it] This will make you smile, yeah, whether you want to or not. [puts the giant teeth in SpongeBob's mouth] Say cheese.
SpongeBob: Cheese. [picture is taken. Later at home] There I am. [looking at his "Cautious Memories" book] Hey, I don't look so bad after all! [everyone in the book is smiling like SpongeBob]


[One morning at SpongeBob's pineapple, SpongeBob looks out the window, then goes out in the hallway. He yawns and sticks his tongue out. Then he comes out wearing a pair of goggles over his eyes rather than his usual pair of glasses to go jellyfishing. He clears his throat.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: All ready to go jellyfishing today?
Patrick: No. Just kidding!
[SpongeBob laughs. Patrick shows a net with two scoops]
SpongeBob: I see you even brought your double net.
Patrick: Yep. It's three times as fun.
SpongeBob: Um, Patrick? Don't you mean twice as fun?
Patrick: What is?
SpongeBob: Your— never mind.
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, That reminds me. We should probably check the weather report before we go.
SpongeBob: Good idea.
[Cuts back to the pineapple where Patrick and SpongeBob are watching the weather report on TV.]
Phil: And now the weather.
SpongeBob: Here we go.
Phil Preflumster: Thank you, Phil. Today's weather forecast calls for— [a piece of paper is given] A horrible storm will ravage the Bikini Bottom area.
Patrick and SpongeBob: A horrible storm?
Phil Preflumster: You heard me. Panic is not advised although it is recommended. Also, an advisory has been issued to avoid any and all jellyfishing if possible.
[TV turns off, SpongeBob now stands in front of his living room window with some boards in his hands]
SpongeBob: Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up.
Patrick: SpongeBob, this seems like a strange time to start decorating.
SpongeBob: Start dec— you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it.
[He goes up to his big bass on the wall to show Patrick what he is talking about.]
Patrick: Hmm.
SpongeBob: Admire it later, Patrick. Right now, we got to get my house converted into a shelter capable of withstanding extreme weather.
Patrick: You can say that again.
SpongeBob: Actually, I can't.
Patrick: Why?
SpongeBob: Because I just stepped on one of these nails.
[shows a picture of SpongeBob's shoe with a nail sticking out. Cut to Squidward's house humming and tweezing his eyebrows]
Squidward: La da dee, la da da, la da doo. Got ya. Now just one quick flick of the wrist, and—
[cut back to SpongeBob's where Patrick angrily nails a hammer causing a racket at Squidward's]
Squidward: [screams]
[He falls and bumps his head on his toilet, and it looks like his eyebrows are bleeding, because he tweezed his skin off his eyebrow. He looks and gets angry]
Squidward: Grr!
[Then we are back to SpongeBob's pineapple where SpongeBob and Patrick are hammering his door.]
Patrick: Violin.
SpongeBob: Whoo! Nice work, buddy. Now my house can withstand anything nature has to throw at us.
[Squidward angrily knocks down SpongeBob's door]
Patrick: I guess Squidward's not part of nature.
SpongeBob: Squidward! Did you come to weather out the storm with us?
Squidward: No! I— what storm?
SpongeBob: The one Preflumster told us about.
Squidward: Who's that?
Patrick: He's the weatherman on the news channel. He said—
Squidward: I can't understand a word you're saying.
SpongeBob: C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun! While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea...
Patrick: I thought it was cocoa!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Hot cocoa... we'll be drinking.
Patrick: That's better.
Squidward: Well, I think I'll pass.
SpongeBob: Even if I let you borrow my huggly snuggly bunny slippers?
Squidward: Hmm, I'll have to think about that.
SpongeBob: Okay, but you better think fast. Because Patrick really likes my—
[Squidward starts to leave when a bolt of lightning strikes. Squidward comes back burnt from the lightning strike]
SpongeBob: Squidward, welcome back! Here's your slippers.
[another bolt of lightning strikes, and now we see Candles lit]
SpongeBob: That's better.
Squidward: What's better about it? I liked it better before, when I could see!
SpongeBob: Squidward, the lights went out.
Squidward: Yes, they did, when you turned them off!
[Patrick spits out his cocoa]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick! What is it?
Patrick: I never realized how delicious your hot cocoa is.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Patrick.
Squidward: Oh, boy. How about some of those games you promised?
[yet another bolt of lightning strikes. The lightning causes impact on SpongeBob's pineapple leaves. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward get ready to play tic-tac-toe]
SpongeBob: Okay, boys, let's roll to see who goes first.
Squidward: This is tic-tac-toe. You don't roll to see who goes first.
Patrick: He's right. You play rock, paper, scissors for it.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
[shot of the exterior of the pineapple again. Then Patrick holds up a "paper" hand, Squidward also holds up a "paper" hand, and SpongeBob also holds up a "paper" hand]
Patrick: One.
SpongeBob: Two.
Squidward: Three!
SpongeBob: Oh, it's a tie.
Patrick: Darn it!
Patrick, SpongeBob, Squidward: One, two, three.
Patrick: Darn it! I'll get you next time.
Squidward: One, two, three.
SpongeBob: Tie.
Patrick: Darn it!
Squidward: One, two, three.
SpongeBob: Tie.
Patrick: Darn it!
[another shot of the pineapple then cut to Squidward with a tic-tac-toe board already made crossed off the X's]
Squidward: There, I win. See?
[then we see SpongeBob and Patrick thinking. the clothes that Patrick is wearing is a bow, and SpongeBob is wearing a visor with reading glasses]
Patrick: I'm not seeing anything there.
SpongeBob: Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk.
Squidward: What do you mean, you're not seeing anything?! There's three in a row right here. Tic-tac-toe!
Patrick: Easy, friend.
SpongeBob: Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun.
[he takes out a rulebook for tic-tac-toe and flips through pages]
SpongeBob: Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward.
[SpongeBob and Patrick clap]
Patrick: Well played.
[Squidward looks as if he's about to cry. Yet another shot of the pineapple]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. You can do it.
[Patrick groans]
SpongeBob: Be the puzzle piece.
Patrick: Cannot complete jigsaw puzzle! Difficulty level too advanced. Rate of brain activity increasing. Ageing process by 30 years per second. [as Patrick turns into an old man, and then a fart noise]
SpongeBob: Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you.
Patrick: Eh? [holds up ear trumpet]
SpongeBob: Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, Go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go!
[Squidward wakes up from a nap]
Squidward: Grrr!
SpongeBob: Go, Patrick, go!
Squidward: I told you creatures I was trying to take a nap over here. Now for the last time can't you just—
SpongeBob: Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?!
Patrick: Who's the green guy?
Squidward: It's the last piece of the puzzle! There's only one place it can go. Right here!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating.
Squidward: Cheating?! It's a jigsaw puzzle! You can't cheat!
SpongeBob: Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over.
[SpongeBob jumbles the pieces, Squidward mumbles]
Squidward: I've got to get out of here!
[yet another lightning bolt strikes Squidward he comes back burnt again]
SpongeBob: Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig—
Squidward: No, I can't.
SpongeBob: Please, Squidward?
Squidward: No way.
SpongeBob: Please...
Squidward: I have an even better idea.
SpongeBob: What is it?
Patrick: Tell us.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!
Squidward: Shh. Quiet time. It's a game called "boundaries."
Patrick: Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Squidward: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Will there be any spelling in this game?
Squidward: Oh, no, no spelling.
Patrick: Yes!
Squidward: It's very simple. The object of the game is to see how long everyone leaves Squidward alone until the storm passes. He will stay inside boundaries, he'll define by chalk lines on the floor.
SpongeBob: I have a question.
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: Where are you going to get the chalk?
Squidward: I brought some!
[yet another flash of lightning. An organ plays an ominous tune as Squidward goes up to SpongeBob's room. He draws the chalk line at the top of the stairs then tosses the chalk to SpongeBob and Patrick. Then, Squidward slams SpongeBob's bedroom door.]
Squidward: Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward. Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over. [his stomach starts growling] Wait a minute. I'm starving. SpongeBob's got to have some snacks around here somewhere. Ah, Jackpot. [he starts eating snail food. Gary meows] I bet you wish you had some of this, don't—? Snail food? [he spits the food out] I've got to get some real food. [SpongeBob is now dressed as a security guard]
SpongeBob: Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary.
Squidward: I'm the one who drew the line. You're not supposed to cross.
SpongeBob: If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers.
Squidward: Identific—? Fine. But when this storm blows over, you'll regret this, mister. What the— what? I don't have them. they must be in my other pants. Look, if you just let me cross, I can go get them. Please, I promise I'll—
SpongeBob: Hmm. You may be telling the truth.
Squidward: Oh, thank you. I'm just so hungry.
SpongeBob: But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth.
Squidward: That'll be the day.
[Squidward runs downstairs, SpongeBob blows his whistle. Squidward makes it towards the kitchen, and start taking food from SpongeBob's refrigerator]
SpongeBob: Stop that cephalopod!
[he jumps out of his security guard costume leaving on his underwear, and jumps on Squidward's back]
Squidward: Please. I just want to get back... onto my side of boundary.
SpongeBob: This, I cannot allow. It is against the rules.
Squidward: But all I wanted was something to eat.
Patrick: Did somebody say something to eat?
SpongeBob: Patrick, look out!
Squidward: Whoa! [screams]
[SpongeBob and Squidward run into Patrick leaving food everywhere]
Squidward: My food!
SpongeBob: Your food?
Patrick: Hey, I want some too.
[they run around in circles screaming and acting like cavemen. SpongeBob takes a piece of bread. Patrick takes a can and chews on it. Squidward runs past him and Patrick protects his can. Squidward has a hamburger but SpongeBob takes it. SpongeBob and Squidward pull but the hamburger sticks to the wall.]
Squidward: Is this what we've really come to? Is one little storm all it takes to turn us all into complete animals?
SpongeBob: Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways.
Squidward: Did you hear that?
SpongeBob: It's just Patrick gnawing on his can.
Squidward: No, no, no, no, no, no, not that. I mean from outside.
SpongeBob: I don't hear anything.
Squidward: The storm must've stopped.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait!
Squidward: Woo-hoo! So long, suckers! [screams]
[SpongeBob's pineapple is now at the top of a tornado and Squidward falls down from the top to the ground.]
Squidward: Oof! Oh, curse you, Preflumster!


[The episode opens with the fist falling off the roof of the Chum Bucket. Plankton walks out on the roof and appears to be covering something in his wagon with a grey old rag.]
Plankton: I'm ready, I'm ready! Ready to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula! Prepare to initiate plan number... hmmm... number. What's the number? Oh well. Who cares?
Karen: Good question.
Plankton: Say what?
Karen: I said good luck!
[Karen pushes the wagon.]
Plankton: That formula will be mine!
[Plankton drives across the street and into front doors of the Krusty Krab.]
Plankton: [driving through the customers] Out of my way, pinheads! Move it, move it, move it! [rings the bell at Squidward's cash register] Hey there, snazola! I'm about to show you the advantage of not having a nose. Say hello to... Mr. Stinky!
[Plankton takes of the rag and reveals a skunk named Mr. Stinky. The customers think Mr. Stinky is a cat and look at it in awe.]
Plankton: That's right, everyone. Gather in real close. [pulls out remote] Time to trigger the stench! [pushes button] Yoink!
[The siren on Mr. Stinky's helmet lights up and the helmet lets in a bumble bee. Mr. Stinky gets really scared and sprays fumes of his horrible smell all over the Krusty Krab. The customers including Squidward couldn't take the smell and ran out of the restaurant. The fumes went into the kitchen where SpongeBob was flipping Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [tries to wave away the fumes with his spatula] No, no, no, no, no, no!
[The Krabby Patties get engulfed with the fumes.]
SpongeBob: Not the patties! I'll save you!
[SpongeBob absorbs the fumes with his nose. But because the stench smelled so terrible, he teared up. Mr. Krabs, disturbed by the noise, comes out of his office.]
Mr. Krabs: What's all the racket out here?
[Mr. Krabs sniffs the air. But when he smelled the skunk fumes, his eyes turned green and popped like balloons. The customers continue to panic outside as the HAZMAT Unit condemns the restaurant so they can rid the horrible smell. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run out with fumes all over them. A firefighter sprays the fumes off of them with a hose.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you alright? What happened?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. Me eyes were burning! All I saw was a little eyeball and a pair of antenna and... [pauses] Plankton! [SpongeBob gasps] He's still in there! Alone! With me secret formula! He could be doing anything with it! [grabs SpongeBob] He could be reading it!
[Mr. Krabs lets go of SpongeBob and takes off his nose.]
Mr. Krabs: Give me your hand, boy-oh! [grabs SpongeBob's arm] I need to borrow this. [cuts off SpongeBob's arm and puts it on his face as a nose plug] Ok, I'm going in!
SpongeBob: Good luck, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs walks back into the restaurant and, using SpongeBob's hand as a fan, waves some of the fumes away for him to see where he's going. Mr. Stinky eats the bumble bee and didn't notice Mr. Krabs sneaking past him. Mr. Krabs makes it to his office and sees Plankton planting dynamite sticks around the safe.]
Mr. Krabs: Why you little...
Plankton: I hope you like percussion, Eugene. Because these drumsticks really go bongo! [laughs]
[Plankton jumps off the safe and ignites the dynamite sticks with the battery on Mr. Krabs' desk, creating a loud explosion. As the smoke clears, the safe opens. But much to Plankton's charging, there is another safe inside.]
Plankton: What? The old safe in the safe routine?
[Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton with SpongeBob's arm.]
Mr. Krabs: Here's another routine! You're the meat in me knuckle sandwich!
Plankton: I'm not hungry!
[Mr. Krabs crushes Plankton with his fists. Plankton is now spattered on his left fist.]
Mr. Krabs: Eww. [throws away Plankton's antenna] SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob comes in with his right leg on the spot where his nose is.]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. I see the problem.
[SpongeBob regrows his left arm and right leg. He uses his spatula to scoop Plankton off of Mr. Krabs' fist. Mr. Krabs opens the window and SpongeBob flings Plankton out with his spatula. Meanwhile, the HAZMAT Unit takes Mr. Stinky out of the restaurant, puts him in a basket tied with balloons, and lets him float back up to the surface. However, the wind blows the balloons and makes the basket go the other direction. The basket floats into Bikini Bottom where Mr. Stinky sprays his fumes once more. The Bikini Bottomites frantically scream and run around as the horrible smell drives them crazy. Back in the restaurant, SpongeBob blows the fumes out with a fan.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew! That was too close my lad. Three more safes and he would've had me secret formula.
[Mr. Krabs unlocks the second safe.]
Mr. Krabs: Looks like I'm going to have to beef up security around here.
[Mr. Krabs pushes the buttons on the third safe and opens up, revealing a steel container inside. Mr. Krabs takes it out and puts it on his desk.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm going to need you to do me a big favor, laddie.
[Mr. Krabs pushes the buttons on the container and it opens up, revealing the bottle with the secret formula inside.]
Mr. Krabs: [gives SpongeBob the bottle] Take this home with ya and hide it while I reevaluate my security situation.
[Mr. Krabs throws away the container and pounds on his desk. The vibrations of Mr. Krabs' fists shakes the room which also made SpongeBob drop the bottle.]
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, how do you know it will be safe from Plankton at my house?
Mr. Krabs: Pisha! He'll think it's still here! His tiny brain is incapable of the kind of abstract thinking that is required for reflection. Or thoughtful reasoning and deduction. He cannot ruminate.
[As Mr. Krabs talks to SpongeBob, the antenna Plankton lost was recording everything and Plankton was listening from outside.]
Mr. Krabs: [voiceover] He cannot define the hypothesis. He's a tired clown. He'll never know it's in your house!
Plankton: [gets an idea] Oh, you're right, Professor Krabface! I'm much too simple-minded to look there! [laughs]
[The scene changes to closing time at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob quietly sneaks out and tries to go home with the secret formula. Plankton is seen standing by the sign.]
Plankton: Hey, there.
[SpongeBob hides the formula in one of his holes on his back.]
Plankton: Pleasant night, eh SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Oh, uh, yes. It's a very nighty-night for a walkie.
Plankton: Ain't that the truth? Hey, nothing gets past you. One could say you have the formula for honesty.
SpongeBob: Uh, yeah. One could say that I guess. Uh, anyway. I gotta go wash my formula. [freaks out] Hair! Hair! I got to go wash my hair! Uh, good night, Plankton.
[SpongeBob tips his hat, literally revealing the formula on his head. Plankton paused for a bit but relaxes.]
Plankton: Yeah. Gotta keep that hair clean and in a safe place.
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Okay, bye!
[SpongeBob leaves to go home.]
French Narrator: The next morning...
SpongeBob: Now remember, Gary. I'm entrusting you with the secret formula.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Stay sharp, Gary. Don't let anyone inside.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Bye, Gary!
[Plankton is on a rock, watching SpongeBob and Gary. He sees SpongeBob leave his home to work at the Krusty Krab. Plankton laughs and comes up with a plan. Inside SpongeBob's house, Gary guards the door until he hears a knock.]
Gary: Meow.
[Gary answers the door and sees Plankton in the disguise as a salesman. Plankton gently pets Gary, but Gary growls angrily at him.]
Plankton: Why, hey there, little fella!  Is SpongeBob... [clears throat] I mean your master at home? [Plankton's fake ear slips, but he pushes it back.] Eh, perhaps I could just come inside for a minute and demonstrate our fine snail products.
[Plankton opens his case and shows snail care products.]
Plankton: Shell polish, slime deodorant, chew toys...
Gary: Meow! [Gary slams the door on Plankton, breaking off part of his disguise.]
Plankton: My leg!
[Gary looks through the window and sees Plankton hopping away on one of his stilts from his disguise.]
Plankton: Your friends won't tell you this, but you can really use the slime deodorant, smelly!
French Narrator: Moments later...
[Gary is seen reading the paper on SpongeBob's chair, until he hears the doorbell ringing.]
Gary: Meow?
[Gary answers the door and sees Plankton disguise as a girl scout selling cookies.]
Plankton: Hello, sir... [clears throat and talks in a higher voice] Hello, sir! I'm selling Sweetie Patrol cookies! We have a lovely assortment of fungi and algae flavors.
[Plankton sits on the sofa with the cookie box and holds out a list.]
Plankton: How many delicious boxes can I put you down for? If you order ten boxes, I'll qualify for my bottom-dweller badge. If you order a hundred boxes, I'll get my bling-bling badge. You know, you should hide these from your roommate. She'll eat all of them. [regular voice] If you show me your best hiding place, I'd be happy to help.
[It's soon shown that the sofa was pushed outside of the house with Plankton on it.]
Gary: Meow, meow!
[Gary slams the door. Plankton got so mad, he threw the cookie box on the ground and the box exploded.]
Plankton: [dazed] Note to self: Nitroglycerin is not a substitute for vanilla extract. [his antennas are blown to dust and he faints]
French Narrator: More moments later...
[Gary is seen growling at the window where he spots Plankton making faces at him. Gary comes out of the house.]
Gary: Meow?
[Gary discovers that it was just a decoy and growls in frustration. As he goes to look for Plankton, a hole is seen on the bottom of the house. Inside, it's revealed that the hole was made by Plankton who was actually biting his way in. Plankton spits the pineapple out of his mouth.]
Plankton: I forgot how much I hate pineapple.
[Gary continues to look for Plankton from the living room to the kitchen. As Gary slithered by his litter box, Plankton pops his head out. Gary looked suspiciously at his litter box, but continues looking for Plankton.]
Plankton: [munches on the snail litter] Hey, this snail litter tastes better than pineapple. [swallows] Now, where is that secret formula?
[Plankton hops out and runs into the living room]
Plankton: Where is it? Where is it? Gotta be here somewhere.
[Plankton knocks down a table with a plant.]
Plankton: Nothing in there. [sees one of the hooks on SpongeBob's decoration] Ooh, look at that.
[Plankton grabs the hook and pops SpongeBob's chair. He knocks over the table and looks in the shell phone.]
Plankton: Hello!
[His voice echoes. Plankton jumps on the wall and rips the wallpaper off.]
Plankton: Where the barnacles is it?
[Plankton rips the floor and sees nothing underneath.]
Plankton: Where is it? Where is it? I know you're in here! You're not fooling anybody! I went to college!
[Plankton runs into the kitchen, opens the fridge, and jumps up and down to find the formula. He climbs on the stove and knocks over the fridge. Then he knocks over the stove, walks through the pipe and went into the cupboards.]
Plankton: Nope, nope, nope.
[As he is searching, he throws some dishes, kitchen appliances, and a huge trash can. He comes out with a turkey baster. Plankton thought that the baster could come in handy and puts it in his pocket. Gary is napping in SpongeBob's room until he hears the commotion from downstairs.] 
[He goes to see what's making the noise. Plankton manages to hide himself from Gary. Once the coast is clear, he runs upstairs to SpongeBob's room. Gary spots Plankton going upstairs and shutting the door. Plankton searches through SpongeBob's room to find the formula.]
[A light bulb pops out from Gary's eye and lights up, giving Gary an idea on how to catch Plankton.]
[Plankton comes out of SpongeBob's room and heads downstairs. On his way down, he slips on Gary's slime, lands and bounces off a mattress and gets flown into the ceiling fan. The fan spins him around and throws him through the basketball net. Plankton falls through the pipe and lands on a record player. Gary snickers as he caught Plankton into his trap. The player spins Plankton around until he gets caught on the needle. The player flies Plankton onto a board and he lands on a puddle of glue where he gets stuck. The bowling ball on the stool rolls down and board, squishes Plankton, rolls across the floor, and hits ten flower pots like knocking down bowling pins. Then a small vacuum cleaner comes out, sucks up the dirt and broken pottery, and traps Plankton inside. Plankton pops out of the vacuum gasping for air.]
Plankton: Alright, Snail! Let's go! Just you and me!
Gary: Meow!
Plankton: Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
[Gary fights Plankton with his eye stalks. During the fight, Plankton notices an opening in Gary's shell.]
Plankton: Of course! What a fool I've been!
[Plankton climbs into Gary's shell. Inside, the shell has random things covered in slime.]
Plankton: SpongeBob's hidden the secret formula inside Gary's shell! Sheesh! This place is disgusting! I bet it reeks. Good thing I don't have a nose. Huh? [turns around and sees Gary's eye following him] Aye yae yae!
[Gary's eye chases Plankton up, down, left, and right all around the inside of his shell. It wasn't long until SpongeBob returned home from work.]
SpongeBob: Gary, I'm home!
[SpongeBob gasps in shock to see that his house is completely demolished.]
SpongeBob: What happened here? [gasps] My first Krabby Patty! I had it bronzed! Oh, and I was gonna give that to my grandchildren! [gasps] My Mermaid Man collectible underpants! Oh, I could've worn them a thousand more times! [gasps] My glass of water! [teary] I was gonna drink that! Oh, the Krabby Patty formula!
[It's revealed that SpongeBob hid the formula on top of his television in disguise as an antenna.]
SpongeBob: Whew! It's safe and right where I left it.
[SpongeBob notices Gary with his left eye in his shell and growling.]
SpongeBob: Gary, did you do this?
Gary: [growls]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Gary? Something wrong with your shell?
Gary: Meow, meow!
SpongeBob: Something's not right, Gary.
[Gary pulls his eye back out of his shell.]
SpongeBob: I'd better get you to the vet.
Gary: Meow.
[Meanwhile, inside Gary's shell, Plankton continues running around until he reaches a dead-end, which he almost falls into a deep hole.]
Plankton: Ha! I lost him! Now, I'm lost!
[Suddenly, something tilts the shell and Plankton falls into the hole. He lands into the shell's center.]
Plankton: Ah, my head. Oh, I must be in the center of the shell. [he sees a piece of paper stuck in the slime] What's that? [opens it] This is it! Just like I thought! It was hidden here all the time! The secret Krabby Patty formula! It's beautiful!
[Just then, a shimmering light appears.]
Plankton: The heavenly light! I always knew I'd see it once I've gotten the formula! Let me bask in its glory! [sighs]
[However, the light was actually coming from the vet where the doctor opened Gary's shell to find Plankton hallucinating from the fumes inside. And the paper he found is actually a shopping list.]
Doctor: Well, that's odd. Who's that?
SpongeBob: Hey, it's Plankton.
Doctor: What's he got there?
SpongeBob: Looks like one of my old grocery lists.
Doctor: I don't know how he got in there, but the gases inside this shell are making the little guy hallucinate. He would've smelled the gases if he had a nose like most good-hearted people. [sniffs]
Plankton: Ha, ha! I got it! I got it!
[Plankton, still hallucinating, runs out of the vet with the shopping list. The doctor, Gary, and SpongeBob watch strangely as he runs off into the sunset.]
Plankton: I've finally got the formula! It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine! Open the sparkling apple juice, Karen! Daddy's bringing the bacon home! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!


[The episode begins with a morning at Conch Street. Squidward is coming out of his house with a bunch of stuff.]
Squidward: [sighs] One glorious week [pulls out his keys] without those two...
[Suddenly, SpongeBob and Patrick appear under the RV.]
SpongeBob: Hey!
[Squidward steps on SpongeBob and Patrick and twirls until he, SpongeBob, and Patrick fly into the air.] [Seaweed music starts playing.]
Squidward: ...Idiots!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Patrick land safely on the ground, but Squidward injures himself and his stuff falls on him. SpongeBob walks towards Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Squidward! [SpongeBob pulls Squidward out by grabbing his head. Eventually, SpongeBob manages to get Squidward, then SpongeBob gets tangled on Squidward's tentacles. Patrick walks to SpongeBob and Squidward as he pulls one of Squidward's tentacles to get SpongeBob out.] You should be more careful.
Patrick: Tisk, tisk... tisk!
Squidward: Would you two go away and stop ruining my vacation?!
SpongeBob: Vacation? Gee, I didn't think Mr. Krabs gave us any vacations.
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick away from him.]
Squidward: I found someone to cover for me.
[We cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Old Man Walker is at register boat for taking Squidward's side.]
Old Man Walker: One Krabby Patty coming up, sir.
[Old Man Walker tries to work the cash register. He presses the button that opens and sends himself straight through the window to the kitchen. Cut back at Conch Street where Squidward is putting his case and sack on the top of his RV.]
SpongeBob: Where are you going on your vacation, Squidward?
Squidward: If you must know, I'm going to Porpoise Peak to bask in the melodious sounds of the Warbling Water Lily. [A cloud appears and shows the Warbling Water Lily. Imagination SpongeBob and Patrick appear and whiteness the Warbling Water Lily. A clock appears in the sky and the big hand points at the 500.] Which only blooms once every five hundred years. [The cloud pops and Imagination SpongeBob and Patrick come out small. Squidward grabs them.] And I'm going alone. [smacks the mini SpongeBob and Patrick together and the mini Patrick runs up to SpongeBob and Patrick as Patrick puts the mini Patrick in his pocket]}}
SpongeBob: I know! [quickly runs back with a different outfit and a case] Patrick and I will come along, and we can all be alone together.
Squidward: Oh no, you're not messing up my vacation. [picks up SpongeBob's case and slams it on him] Now beat it! If I don't get moving, I'm gonna miss it. [walks to get himself packed and ready]
SpongeBob: [pops out of the case with Squidward's shirt on] Oh, we'll help you pack.
Squidward: No way, you idiots will just break... [But SpongeBob and Patrick didn't break anything. They got Squidward's stuff packed.] ...everything? [impressed] Oh.
Patrick: Hold it! [steps of the RV and falls] We forgot to pack this. [points at the ramp]
[Patrick uses his mouth to pull the ramp off of the RV. SpongeBob hops off the RV and helps Patrick to pull the ramp off. They both pull it off until it hits Patrick's face. Patrick then laughs.]
Squidward: What? No, don't! Stop!
[Suddenly, the RV drives off. Squidward screams in terror as he watches his RV drive off in the distance. He runs off after it and pushes SpongeBob and Patrick over. Squidward then stops and watches the RV drive off. SpongeBob and Patrick shows up and watch it too. The RV drives off though traffic, then it hits a sign that says "Bridge Out". The RV then drives through two rings of fire and passes by an octopus' arm. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward worry that the RV would crash until it finally stops.]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Phew.
[But as soon as they are relieved that the RV stopped, an anchor smashes the RV, causing it to explode. Squidward becomes utter shocked that his RV is destroyed thanks to SpongeBob and Patrick. Now he can't see the warbling water lily.]
Patrick: You could buff that out.
[Squidward gets angry and ink splatters out of his head.]
Squidward: [to Patrick] How could?!... [to SpongeBob] Why would?!... [stutters] I can't believe it! [Squidward has angered out words until he turns sad. A tire is on fire and starts wheeling towards SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward.] I'll never see the warbling water-lily bloom now.
[Squidward then walks to his house and bangs his head on the door to open it. Squidward then enters his house all sad and closes his door, now that his chances of seeing the warbling water lily are shattered. SpongeBob and Patrick feel ashamed of themselves of what they have done: They ruined Squidward's hopes of seeing the warbling water lily. SpongeBob and Patrick begin to feel bad for Squidward as he walks to his house.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh. Poor Squidward.
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh! I have an idea.
Patrick: Really? What's that like?
[Inside Squidward's bedroom, Squidward is getting ready for bed. He is still angry at SpongeBob and Patrick for ruining his hopes on seeing the warbling water lily.]
Squidward: Little monsters. They oughta be locked up. Throw away the key and then... [snores] Locked up and throw them away. [Squidward dreams that he is at Porpoise Peak seeing the warbling water lily. Squidward drives his RV, then sings and dances to two warbling water lilies. He smells them until the warbling water lilies open and reveals to be SpongeBob and Patrick. They start laughing, a purple shadow background shows. Squidward wakes up from his sleep and screams in horror. He is now in SpongeBob's house.] Oh, oh, phew. It was only a nightmare. [The camera zooms out revealing SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward looks at SpongeBob and screams, he then looks at Patrick then screams as well. SpongeBob and Patrick both scream as Squidward screams. Squidward grabs their mouths.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward.
Squidward: [pulls them over] Would you get out of my bedroom?!
SpongeBob: [laughs] We're not in your bedroom, silly.
[Squidward notices his bed is in SpongeBob's living room. He quickly jumps off of his bed.]
Squidward: What? How did I get here?
SpongeBob: Patrick and I mo-
Squidward: [covers SpongeBob's mouth] Actually, I don't care. [leaves to get out of SpongeBob's house] Goodbye, SpongeB- [Just as Squidward was about to leave, he falls out of SpongeBob's door, which his house is now an RV.] [Sponge Monger music starts playing.] [Squidward quickly gets back inside SpongeBob's house, he then notices two-passenger seats and a steering wheel. Squidward notices SpongeBob's house is an RV.] SpongeBob, why is your house... [screaming] driving on the road?!
Patrick: Because we turned it into an RV!
SpongeBob: We didn't want you to miss that flower blooming.
Squidward: Okay. Hold on. Who's driving?
Patrick: It's on Autosnail.
[Gary is shown driving and is being distracted by his toy.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Come on, let's get breakfast. [takes Squidward's hand]
[Bubble transition to the kitchen where Patrick and Squidward are sitting. Patrick is laughing while he has a knife and fork in his hand. SpongeBob tosses three coffee mugs, three plates, and coffee on the table. He then walks to the table with two stacks of pancakes. Squidward smells them.]
Squidward: Hey, this looks pretty good.
[All of a sudden, unknowing to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, the RV drives to a wobbly damaged bridge. Squidward is about to eat his pancakes, but the plates slide off due to the RV on the bridge. Squidward tries to eat his pancakes again but misses again. The RV wobbles onto the bridge. Finally, Squidward reaches his pancakes with his fork. Squidward is about to eat his pancakes, but the RV drives into a bump on the bridge. Squidward accidentally puts the pancakes in his mouth and chokes. He then spits the pancakes out in front of Patrick.]
Patrick: [points at the pancakes] Are you gonna eat that?
[The RV is off the bridge, which causes it to break. Gary is shown tired for driving so much.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, let's give Gary a break.
Patrick: Disengaging Autosnail! [presses a button to give the toy to Gary]
[Gary starts chewing on his toy while Patrick takes his place.]
Gary: [chewing on his toy] Meow, meow, meow, meow.
Patrick: Let's see what this pineapple can do! [Patrick presses on the breaks and drives faster, which it follows him running over a "Road Closed" sign and drives to the mountain. Squidward notices how high they are and sees a bunch of boats all damaged.] On the road!
Squidward: [gulps] We gotta get off this road!
Patrick: No problem.
[Patrick then press a button which activates rocket boosters from the back of the RV. He drives off very fast on five roads. Patrick is driving so fast it sends Squidward off his seat and slams on the wall. He then notices SpongeBob next to him.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: [screams] I'm not here! This isn't happening!
[Suddenly, the RV drives on the steepest hill and up a ramp. It then flies in mid-air. Inside the RV, Squidward floating in mid-air as the RV is flying. Squidward grabs onto a door and accidentally opens it. A bunch of SpongeBob's stuff comes out of his door. Squidward misses it, but gets hit by a safe. SpongeBob is watching TV, which is floating along with his couch and chair. Gary is still chewing on his toy while floating as well. Patrick begins to float too. The RV lands on the road which they arrive at Porpoise Peak. Squidward hits through the sign. SpongeBob exits out of his house.]
SpongeBob: [laughs cheerfully] We're here!
Squidward: [shakes his head] Huh? [Squidward gasps as he sees the warbling water lily.] The warbling water lily! [pulls out his camera and runs towards the flower] Oh, so beautiful! And I have it all to my... [Suddenly, a group of people show up to see the flower and start taking pictures.] Ow! My back! [Squidward moves a few people out of his way, so he can take a picture of the flower, but it suddenly disappears.] Huh? Where is it?
[Patrick comes up with the warbling water lily.]
Patrick: Is this that babbling buttercup you were looking for?
[Patrick gives Squidward the flower as everyone looks in surprise. The flower then sprouts out, a light glows right before Squidward's eyes and starts playing music. But all of a sudden, the flower starts to dry out. Everyone gasps in complete shocked. Squidward is shocked to see that the flower as dried out as well.] [House of Horror music starts playing.] [Everyone gets angry at Squidward and starts attacking him. SpongeBob walks towards the flower and notices how dry out it is. The fishes take Squidward and bury him into the ground and leave. Monroe comes up with a watering can and waters Squidward out of the ground like a flower. SpongeBob and Patrick come up to Squidward and SpongeBob smells his head. Squidward comes out and gets rid of the dirt.]
Squidward: Well, that's one more vacation down the drain. May as well go home.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Well, we got a long drive ahead of us. [pulls toilet paper out of his hole] We better go before go if you know what I mean-o.
Patrick: [laughs] Not really.
SpongeBob: Now, Squidward, don't leave without us. [laughs and leaves]
Squidward: [gets an idea] Huh? Of course not! Only a monster would leave you behind. [Squidward grins evilly and eventually, he leaves them behind, driving the RV.] So I'm a monster. [whistles] They'll be fine. Alone. [begins to sweat] On top of a mountain. In the middle of nowhere. [But Squidward stops the RV, realizing that he can't leave SpongeBob and Patrick behind.] D'oh, I can't do it!
[Squidward reverses back to get SpongeBob and Patrick. We cut back to the woods where SpongeBob and Patrick are finished using the bathroom. Patrick has toilet paper all over him.]
SpongeBob: Hey, you're really getting the hang of using toilet paper, Patrick.
Patrick: And next week, I'm starting on two-ply.
SpongeBob: I'll get another roll from the RV. [SpongeBob walks towards to the RV, but to find that it's gone, due to Squidward leaving them behind.] Hey, where is the RV?
Patrick: [points] Well, maybe those guys have seen it. Hey, hey! Have you seen our pineapple?
[A group of sea bears, like the ones from "The Camping Episode”, show up and growls at Patrick. We cut back to Squidward still driving the RV to get SpongeBob and Patrick. He then parks the RV and looks for SpongeBob and Patrick. All of a sudden, SpongeBob and Patrick’s screams are heard.]
Squidward: Oh no, I'm too late! [Squidward runs to a cave and karate chops one of the sea bears.] Don't you dare eat those morons!
[But instead of hearing screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick were laughing and tickling the sea bears.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, they weren't eating us.
Patrick: We were just having a tickle fight. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Sea bears love it when you tickle their bellies.
Patrick: [laughs] But they hate it when you karate chop their hineys.
Squidward: [realizing what he has done while the sea bears growl at him] Uh, tickle, tickle?
[The sea bears begin to attack and maul Squidward.] [Sponge Monger music plays again.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, they'll leave you alone if you play dead!
Patrick: [pulls out a tombstone that says "RIP Squidward" and throws it at Squidward] This will help! Catch!
[The tombstone hits Squidward's head while he is being mauled to death. The sea bears stop mauling Squidward and leaves.]
SpongeBob: Bye. Call me. You got my number. [Bubble transition to Conch Street where the RV bumps into Squidward's house and parks. SpongeBob kicks open the door.] Wow! Was that a fun road trip or was that a fun road trip? [Patrick comes out of the RV and spins in the air of excitement.]
Patrick: The funnerest!
[Squidward walks up out of the RV with bandages on him after being attacked by sea bears.]
Squidward: More like the worst road trip. My one chance to hear the warbling water lily and you ruined it! [falls out of the RV]
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Are you sure about that, Squidward? [pulls out the flower] Ohh, poor thing just needs some love. [pours water into the pot and kisses it]
Squidward: [gasps] The warbling water lily! [The warbling water lilt begins to play.] So beautiful. [pulls out his clarinet and plays]
SpongeBob: Oh, my ears! My ears! It hurts! It hurts! [SpongeBob breaks apart and Patrick's head explodes and screams.] We're so happy for you, Squidward!
[They run back into the RV to escape from the racket.]
Patrick: Engage Autosnail!
[The episode ends with SpongeBob and Patrick drive off as Squidward plays his clarinet with the warbling water lily.]


Squidward: [The scene starts at the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob cleaning a table] Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home!
[phone rings]
SpongeBob: I got it, I got it! Coming! [leaps for the phone, but Squidward answers it first. SpongeBob falls to the floor and exclaims]
Squidward: Hello. Sorry, sir. We're close... [Mr. Krabs snatches phone]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there! Krusty Krab, how could I help you? [customer explains order over phone] Pizza? [eyes turn into dollar signs] Ummm... of course we have pizza!
Squidward: Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Our delivery squid will bring it right over. [hangs up]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza. [Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby patties and turns it into pizza. Then he puts it in a box] We don't deliver!
Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver. [gives Squidward the pizza] But you do.
Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
Mr. Krabs: Great idea! Take him with you. [SpongeBob sneaks over smiling big]
Squidward: That's not what I had in mind!
SpongeBob: Front end... check. Antenna... [touches the boat antenna making it vibrate] check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker... [bumper sticker says "I Brake For Sea Urchins"] ...check. [uncaps the tire pressure and puts his mouth in it, causing him to inflate like a balloon, and talk in a squeaky, high pitched voice while he is now the size of a giant parade balloon] Tire pressure! [blows out the rest of the pressure in Squidward's face, returning him to his normal size and voice] ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever!
Squidward: Good, then you drive.[tosses his hat away]
SpongeBob: I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner.
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, but...
Squidward: Just do what you do in school.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.
Squidward: Back it up.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Squidward: Back... it up.
SpongeBob: Right, back... it up. [tries to move the stick shift down]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay!
Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse! Right... uhh...?!?!?! [SpongeBob imagines the words "FORWARD" and "BACKWARD" turning into Korean characters, 앞으로가 (FORWARD) and 뒤로가 (BACKWARD)]
Squidward: BACK IT UP!
SpongeBob: [shifts gears] BACKING UP! BACKING UUUUPPPPP! [boat backs up really fast]
Squidward: [tries to get the wheel] GIVE ME THE WHEEL, SPONGEBOB! GIVE ME THE WHEEEEEEEEL!
SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up! [they go over a bumpy area with rocks and then they spin around and around and around, screaming. The next morning, the boat goes over five hills] Backing up! Backing up! Backing up! Backing up... [boat stops with no fuel left] ...backing up.
Squidward: Well, you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? [echoing] We're in the middle of nowhere!
SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.
Squidward: And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?! [kicks boat and the boat's gasoline becomes full again and it drives away into the distance without them]
SpongeBob: Well... we can still deliver it on foot. [Squidward narrows his eyes. Later, both walk on the sand]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: [singing] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
Squidward: ...and my feet are killing me. Whoa! [trips over SpongeBob, who is lying on the ground] SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: [rubbing the ground] It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is no time for...
SpongeBob: Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: [pointing to the road] Truck! Sixteen wheels! Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked. [starts dancing in the road while wearing a hat] WheeeeEEEEEeeee... eeeEEEEEeee... [Squidward sits on a rock while playing with a wooden spoon]
Truck Driver: Crashin', frashin' break dancers! [honks his truck]
Squidward: He's stopping, he's stopping! [Squidward realizes he's not stopping and grabs SpongeBob out of the way where they are covered in sand thanks to the truck. Squidward narrows his eyes at the smiling SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Squidward are now in a place with heavy winds] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me! The Krusty Krab pizza [The wind blows on Squidward's nose making it touch his face so he puts it down, only for it to touch his face again so he puts it in his mouth.] is the pizza free delivery! The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. [SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds]
Squidward: Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!
SpongeBob: [still being carried around in the air] I can't, it's for the customer!
Squidward: Who cares about the customer?!
SpongeBob: I do!
Squidward: Well, I don't!
SpongeBob: [wind stops and SpongeBob gasps] Squidward! [starts flying again]
Squidward: Let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! [runs over Squidward]
Squidward: Ow. [holding SpongeBob's legs] SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! It's for the customer!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [notices a tornado in front of them] Let go of the pizza! [lifts up into the tornado]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [looks down] Hang onto the pizza! [tornado spits them both out. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground] Hey! Hey! [crawls up to the screen] Where's the road? Wh-wh-wh-where's the road?! [a tumbleweed rolls by] We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go??? [SpongeBob lands] What are we gonna do now!? There's no road here!
SpongeBob: I think town's this way. [points]
Squidward: Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
SpongeBob: That's right. [points to a mossy rock] Moss always points to civilization.
Squidward: That way? That way there? [SpongeBob nods] So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
SpongeBob: [nods again] Yep.
Squidward: Well, then I'm going this way. [heads the other way]
SpongeBob: Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
Squidward: Trust me, I know where I'm going. [Pans out to show another city in the other direction]
SpongeBob: [sings] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally. [later] pizza... [starts beatboxing] pizza... [later, SpongeBob is walking backwards. SpongeBob's pants almost split into two and move up and down simultaneously while he continues to beatbox. Still later] Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and [falsetto] me-eeeeee-eee-ee-eeeeeeeeeee!! [later] Krab Pizza... for you... Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside... [Later, they are both lying face down in the sand]
Squidward: Sponge, we gotta eat something.
SpongeBob: I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. [Squidward eats some coral] No, maybe it wasn't coral... [Squidward spits out the coral] ...maybe it was sand... no, no, mud.
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
Squidward: Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No, we promised it's for the customer.
Squidward: [fancy music plays] You're right. It's for the customer.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.
SpongeBob: Well?
Squidward: Just a peek. [opens box]
SpongeBob: [he shuts it quickly] Okay, it's fine!
Squidward: No, I think I saw something. [opens box] Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine-looking pizza.
SpongeBob: [entranced] Yeah...
Squidward: What's that? Is that the cheese?
SpongeBob: Yeah...
Squidward: And the pepperoni?
SpongeBob: Yeah...
Squidward: [SpongeBob slurps] Ooh, looks good, huh?
SpongeBob: [snaps out of it] ...wait a second! I know what you're trying to do, Squidward! [closes box] I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Get away!
Squidward: Get back here, SpongeBob! [chases SpongeBob] Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Wait! [he becomes too tired to run]
SpongeBob: No! No! [runs into Squidward]
Squidward: I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
SpongeBob: Look, we're saved!
Squidward: Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
SpongeBob: No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants]
Squidward: Will you cut that out?!
SpongeBob: [to a conga beat] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again. SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
Squidward: That's just a stupid boulder!
SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder!! [sniff] It's a rock! [cries] A ro-ha-hock! A ra-ha-ha-ha-HA-hock! It's a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae. And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks. Hold on there, Jethro!
SpongeBob: [they stop outside the customer's house] I can't wait to see the look on our customer's face! [rings doorbell]
Orange fish: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir, your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
Orange fish: Wow, thanks. I've been dyin' for one of these. It... [brief pause] Where's my drink?
SpongeBob: [confused] What drink?
Orange fish: [in an angry tone] My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink!
SpongeBob: [checks through the order] But... you didn't order any drink.
Orange fish: [yelling] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!?
SpongeBob: But... but... [tears start rolling down his face]
Orange fish: Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy? WELL, I AIN'T BUYIN'. [slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry]
Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay... Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [Squidward gets angry, grabs the pizza, stomps towards the customer's house and pounds on the door]
Orange fish: [answers the door, still angry] Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't PAYIN' FOR THAT.
Squidward: [Orange fish's point of view] Well, this one's ON THE HOUSE! [slams the pizza box in the orange fish's face]
SpongeBob: [still crying] Did he change his mind?
Squidward: [smugly] He sure did, ate the whole thing in one bite.
SpongeBob: [stops crying] No drink?
Squidward: Nope. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock]
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work! [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Work...? Oh, my aching tentacles...!


[View of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [from inside] One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day. [cut to inside of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [speaking in French accent] Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. [flips it up in the air and it falls into one of his holes. He holds up the other ingredients]
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Next, les ingredients. [throws them in the air] Ah, oui! [he catches them in his holes and his pants] Les mustard. [he squirts some mustard out and it lands in his eye]
Squidward: [speaking in French accent] Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Les hold on a second! [SpongeBob takes his head and shakes it all up. When he puts it back on his body, his eyes roll around] And voila! [He goes up to Squidward and pulls a Krabby Patty from under his nose; speaking in normal voice] It's under your nose! [Laughs and puts it on a plate. Squidward pretends to laugh]
Squidward: [speaking in normal voice] You're killing me, SpongeBob! Ha ha ha... you really are. [Close-up on the patty].
SpongeBob: Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty..
Squidward: Okay, give it to me. [The Krabby Patty flies off of the plate and starts bouncing all over the place] Come on SpongeBob, stop it!
SpongeBob: I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! [The patty slithers out the door and heads for the exit. Mr. Krabs spears it with his leg. A tiny thing comes out from it and Krabs inspects it with a magnifying glass.]
Mr. Krabs: Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is... [view of in the magnifying glass, of a tiny jelly bean-shaped green creature with one eye] Plankton! Stealing me booty!
Plankton: Hear me, Krabs! When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I'll run you out of business! I went to college! [Krabs picks up the puny pest] Hey! Let me go!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer! [laughs. He splats Plankton on a plate and spins him back across the street, to the Chum Bucket] Back to the Chum Bucket with you!
Plankton: You'll pay for this, Krabs! [slams through the doors]
SpongeBob: Uh... Plankton, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years, but you haven't got it yet, have ye, bug? [laughs. SpongeBob joins in, braying with laughter. Krabs stops, but SpongeBob keeps laughing] Okay. [SpongeBob keeps laughing] Enough, lad, it wasn't that funny. [SpongeBob keeps laughing] Get back to work! [SpongeBob stops laughing. Cut to nighttime at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [from inside] Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs: Good night, me boy! [SpongeBob walks out and walks past the Chum Bucket contently]
Plankton: [unseen] Psst... young man. [SpongeBob looks around to see where this voice came from] Yes, over here. Come on, boy, a little closer. [SpongeBob walks forward] Closer... [SpongeBob walks] Not that close! [a crunching sound is heard. SpongeBob lifts up his shoe revealing a squished Plankton] You blasted barnacle head! I mean... hi. [SpongeBob peels Plankton off his shoe and onto his hand]
SpongeBob: Plankton? What do you want?
Plankton: I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?
SpongeBob: Um... no.
Plankton: Acquaintances?
SpongeBob: No.
Plankton: Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?
SpongeBob: I... guess so.
Plankton: You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment. [rummages through his back pocket and takes out a golden spatula] Ching! [in unison with the sparkling of the spatula] Sparkle, sparkle.
SpongeBob: Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it.
Plankton: It's a gift! A gift from a friend. [hugs SpongeBob's thumb] Friends give each other gifts, and tomorrow is my birthday. [puts a birthday hat on his head and SpongeBob's thumb and then blows a noisemaker. He then takes out a cake] And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? [blows out the candles].
SpongeBob: A booster seat? [Plankton takes off the hat and throws out the cake]
Plankton: Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you, my friend, is one of those [starts to drool] tender... delicious... Krabby Patties! [SpongeBob drops Plankton and gasps]
SpongeBob: You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow!
Plankton: Gee, and I thought you were stupid.
SpongeBob: You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me! [walks off, then stops] Even if we are friends! [runs off] Never, never, never, never!
Plankton: Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool! [takes out a gramophone that plays evil music and laughs evilly to it. Cut to SpongeBob's bedroom, where SpongeBob goes to sleep]
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [Gary meows. SpongeBob goes to sleep. Just then, one of the flowers on SpongeBob's bed pattern pops up. It's Plankton in disguise, wearing a backpack that looks more like an antenna-like machine.]
Plankton: [chuckling] SpongeBob, you will be mine! [pulls out the record player and laughs evilly to it, but it actually plays a children's song of the A-B-C's.]
Woman in the recording: ♪Letters of the alphabet, A-B-C...♪
[Plankton immediately realizes this and flips the record around on the other side. It plays the evil music like last time and he laughs. Then he walks through one of SpongeBob's holes and begins his journey. Plankton reads a map that looks like a regular road map, except with a giant brain in the middle of it.]
Plankton: It should be in here... but where? [pan out to reveal he's standing on the brain] Where? Oh... [takes off the antenna thing on his back] This will be the beginning of the end! [outside, SpongeBob rolls to his left in his sleep. The brain falls to the right inside and Plankton falls off] Ouch! Stupid brain... [gives chase] Come back here, you swine! [SpongeBob then rolls to his right. Inside, the brain squishes Plankton. SpongeBob then sleeps on his back and the brain stops rolling. Plankton holds up a roll of duct tape] That's it, brain, you're going down! [Plankton uses tape to hold it down] Yes, yes, that's grand. [takes out blueprints] And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan. [the blueprints reveal a picture of the antenna thing labeled "Control" and an arrow pointing to a picture of a brain labeled "Brain." Plankton follows these instructions by jamming the control in the brain] And now, it's time for a little wakey-uppy. [his hands on the control levers, he uses his foot to press the "Total Control" button. Outside, SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Morning already? [Plankton jams the controls causing SpongeBob's legs to jam out to his side. He rumbles and falls down. Plankton laughs evilly] I... I feel a little funny today. [using the controls, he makes SpongeBob walk. Plankton laughs]
Plankton: I have you now! [outside, SpongeBob keeps walking towards the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Time for a well-balanced breakfast. [he rams through the wall and through his refrigerator, emerging with bread, a bottle of milk, and an egg carton on his head] This isn't what I had in mind. [he walks towards the straps with his pants attached] Let me just grab my pants. [he walks toward them and they spring him. He eventually gives free and keeps walking] I guess I'm not wearing any pants today. [he crashes through the side of the wall] I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess. [Gary meows] You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help! [inside Squidward's house, he tries to sleep. Off-screen] Squidward! Help!
Squidward: Be quiet, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob bursts through the wall of Squidward's bedroom]
SpongeBob: Help!
Squidward: SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad? [SpongeBob crashes through the opposite wall. He stops walking and his head turns around 180 degrees]
Plankton: [through SpongeBob] Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.
Squidward: Mediocre? [from inside, Plankton speaks through a microphone]
Plankton: You pretentious, little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste! [SpongeBob snaps out of it]
SpongeBob: Something must be wrong with my brain! [SpongeBob's eyes roll into the back of his head and he sees Plankton. Gasps] Plankton! [Plankton raises his eyebrow] What kind of friend are you?
Plankton: Nonsense. You never liked me, anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party! [from outside]
SpongeBob: Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!
Plankton: Never! Never! [laughs and SpongeBob walks out backwards. Squidward faints. SpongeBob crashes through Patrick's rock and reemerges with Patrick sleeping on his head. SpongeBob throws him off and he's pinned into the ground. SpongeBob walks toward the Krusty Krab. Inside SpongeBob] Toot toot! How about a little take-out?
SpongeBob: No! No, never! [he crashes through it, reemerging with a Krabby Patty. Plankton laughs evilly] You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty formula! [SpongeBob walks into the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!
SpongeBob: No, no, no! [they're inside and walk through a door] There's no one here.
Plankton: Don't remind me. Brace yourself, SpongeBob. This is my lab! [the room he's walked into has a screen with a live-action Labrador Retriever. The dog barks. They walk into the next room, a real lab] And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player? [He pulls it out again and it plays dramatic music. Plankton laughs]
SpongeBob: I must fight! [He mumbles nonsensically, stretches his head out, and bites against the side of the door. His body keeps trying to walk.]
Plankton: No, no, no, no. [He pushes the levers forward, which causes SpongeBob to lose grip and slam against the wall and wobble over to a giant funnel thing] There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it. [A robot arm clenching some seaweed comes in and drops it in the giant funnel analyzer. It has zapped and some beeping is heard from the giant computer screen. The screen, then reads what the computer says.]
Karen Plankton: Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed. [a picture of the seaweed appears]
Plankton: Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula. [laughs. pulls the lever forward, letting two of SpongeBob's fingers off the patty. He's holding it with both hands, so one finger from each hand] And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty. [two more fingers loose grip] This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants? [SpongeBob tries to resist, but stops]
SpongeBob: I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down. [His eyes fill up with tears and leak down his cheeks] I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, [One of his teary eyes twinkle] you delicate little Krabby Patty.
Plankton: Mmm...
SpongeBob: [tearing up even more] With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness. [inside, Plankton starts to get hungry]
Plankton: Steamy... [a live-action patty gets assembled on screen as SpongeBob states the ingredients]
SpongeBob: I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. [inside, Plankton starts to drool excessively]
Plankton: Yes... yes... yes! [he jumps out of one of SpongeBob's holes to the patty] Come to papa! [he bounces off the patty and lands in the analyzer] Oh, boy... [he is zapped and the computer reads out the analysis]
Karen: Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas. [Plankton appears on the screen]
Plankton: Well, this stinks.
SpongeBob: Well, patty, I guess we can go home now. [walks out]
Plankton: SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty! [SpongeBob walks out the swivel doors and they go back and forth] Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty! [the doors come to a close] Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries.


[At the Chum Bucket, with Plankton working on The Analyzer.]
Karen: Oh, Planky-bear? Plankton?
[Plankton ignores her]
Karen: Plankton!
Plankton: What? What is it, Karen? Can't you see I'm working there?! [points right close to the electronic components of The Analyzer]
Karen: Yes, but I wanted you to show you my new screensaver. [Shows a screensaver full of flying cake mixers] What do you think?
Plankton: [sarcastically, not looking at her, and still building electrical components] Great.
Karen: [rolls towards Plankton] You didn't even look.
Plankton: Ehh... [looks at Karen] No, I didn't! Can't you see I'm working on my new molecular analyzer? [The Analyzer starts picturing whatever Plankton says] Now all I need is the smallest molecule of a patty and the formula will be mine!
Karen: Just tell me if I should permanently upload the screensaver!
Plankton: I said not now– [accidentally switches The Analyzer on and he gets sucked up by The Analyzer's tube] oww-oww!
[Plankton gets processed into the various machines. He gets smashed by a boot and flipped, dragged over by a robot hand to be wringed out by two other robotic hands. Liquid Plankton goes into another machine to be zapped and processed into binary dump. Plankton makes drowning noises as he is being processed into binary dump.]
The Analyzer: Analyzing... 30% mean guy, 20% spiteful monster, 50% evil butt-head. Sample is... 100% big jerk. [Pushes out Plankton, who is now back in his normal form] I have also analyzed your screensaver, Karen. It is most beautiful! [Rainbow appears on his screen]
Plankton: No one asked you! [Smashes The Analyzer with a wrench] Are you happy now, Karen?
Karen: No, I'm not! I was just trying to make myself pretty for you, but do you even care? All you ever do is make stupid schemes about stupid sandwiches!
Plankton: Stupid? Your new screensaver is stupid and it makes your processor look fat!
Karen: [the cake mixers screensaver changes to a screen with fire; indicating her fury] What?!
Plankton: Oop! Okay, let's all calm down before you say something you'll regret!
Karen: You know what? No one talks to me like that! Get out!
Plankton: I will not get out! This is my restaurant and no one can make me... [gets kicked out] leave! [lands on his face] Ow! Karen, baby. Come on, sugar lips, you know I'm sorry for everything I said.
[Karen barricades the front door with iron bars.]
Medley Fishbowl: I accept your apology.
Plankton: I wasn't taking to you, idiot! [Medley lifts his foot and steps on him.] Pain! [gets up from squished form] Okay, Karen, fun is fun, but it's time to let me back in. Come on, I really need to use the potty!
[Karen barricades the front door with steel doors and lasers.]
Plankton: Fine, I don't need you or the Chum Bucket! I got plenty of friends around here who would love to take me in!
[The scene changes to Plankton talking to Mr. Krabs at his house.]
Plankton: So is it cool if I crash here?
Mr. Krabs: No!
Plankton: Then can I just use your bathroom?
[Mr. Krabs slams the door in Plankton's face and sends him flying in front of SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, I know where this is going. I'd love it if you'd stay with me!
Plankton: Are you crazy? You're the most annoying sponge in the sea. I wouldn't stay with you if you were the last person in Bikini Bottom.
[SpongeBob slurps on a drink. Plankton whimpers over this.]
SpongeBob: Suit yourself.
[SpongeBob walks off as he slurps his drink.]
Plankton: Okay, fine! [follows SpongeBob]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob's house. Plankton comes out of the bathroom.]
Plankton: Whew! Much better. Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Silly, that's not my bathroom.
Plankton: Well, in that case, you're gonna need some new shoes.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Does this mean you're gonna stay with me?
Plankton: [annoyed] Yes!
SpongeBob: Yeah! [pulls a string and confetti, a banner, and balloons fall down] We're gonna be the best roommates ever! Oh! Wanna do each other's hair? [laughs]
Plankton: Oh, forget this!
[Plankton attempts to leave, but SpongeBob grabs him and carries him while laughing.]
French Narrator: Many unbearable hours later...
[SpongeBob and Plankton are watching a movie.]
Male Actor: Oh, my love, what a fool I've been. You've always been the only one for me. [kisses his love]
[Plankton gets teary. He takes out a picture of himself with Karen and looks at it. Plankton starts to cry.]
SpongeBob: Aw, Plankton. I am so sorry that Karen threw you out.
Plankton: Threw me out? I threw her in! [throws away the picture]
SpongeBob: Hey, this is your safe place. It's okay to talk about your feelings. [rubs Plankton's head] Oh, somebody's tense!
Plankton: Hey! What? Get off! Get—Oh! [moans and laughs] Oh, that's the spot.
SpongeBob: Now, tell SpongeBob why you and Karen got into a fight.
Plankton: I don't know, I was just doing the same things I always do.
SpongeBob: Well, if Karen threw you out for doing the same things you always do, maybe you should learn to not do the same things you always do!
Plankton: But I'm the best.
SpongeBob: Well, sometimes you can get a little...aggressive.
Plankton: Me, aggressive?! How dare you?! [punches and smacks SpongeBob's spongy body until he becomes exhausted] Maybe you're right. I can be a big jerk sometimes. I command you to help me be a nicer person! [blushes then shakes SpongeBob's right eye] I mean, will you please, please help me be a nicer person so Karen will take me back?
SpongeBob: Plankton, in a word: yes!
[The scene changes to outside of SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is with Plankton and Patrick and has a door nest to them.]
Plankton: What is that dimwit doing here?
Patrick: Ahh! Oh, behind me! Oh, get away!
Plankton: Will you stop that?! There's no one behind you! You're the dimwit.
Patrick: Oh. Thanks!
SpongeBob: All right, Plankton, the first step to becoming a nicer person is being thoughtful. Try holding a door for someone. It's simple, and it makes people happy. Like this. [opens door] After you.
Patrick: [laughs] I'm happy, SpongeBob! [kisses SpongeBob as he enters through the door; SpongeBob laughs as he closes it] Can someone get me out of here? [SpongeBob opens the door] Whew!
SpongeBob: All right, Plankton. Now you try!
Plankton: Fine, but if he kisses me, I'm gonna lose it. [Patrick skips happily to the door] Ugh. After you.
[Plankton struggles to open the door, but it's too big and heavy for him to open. He continues to struggle until his eye pops out. SpongeBob picks him up.]
Plankton: Whoa!
[SpongeBob puts Plankton's eye back together and places him near a smaller door.]
SpongeBob: Try this one.
Plankton: [opens smaller door] After you.
Patrick: But I can't fit through there.
Plankton: How dare you reject my act of kindness! Yah!
Patrick: Ahh!
[Patrick jumps and flies into the smaller door, making him stuck. Plankton punches Patrick's butt.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, no!
Patrick: Can someone get me out of here?
[Plankton punches Patrick's butt and SpongeBob sighs. The scene changes back inside SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Plankton, since you don't seem to be able to do something nice, in this lesson you're going to learn to say something nice.
Plankton: Easy!
SpongeBob: Great. So turn to Patrick and say something nice.
[Plankton turns to Patrick, who is in a goofy appearance.]

SpongeBob: Say something nice.

Plankton: Uh... Patrick, you're not a total moron. Just half of one.
SpongeBob: No, try again.
Plankton: Fine. Your color pink is not so repugnant.
Patrick: Thanks! I like... um... your antennas.
Plankton: What? What's wrong with my antennas?!
SpongeBob: Plankton, Patrick was complimenting you.
Plankton: Yeah, right! You two are mocking me! [punches SpongeBob and Patrick's bodies]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob? Do you think this is working?
SpongeBob: No, I think we better try something else.
[Plankton collapses from exhaustion. The scene changes back to outside of SpongeBob's house.]
Plankton: It's no use, SpongeBob. I'm just too brilliant to be nice! I'll never get Karen back now.
SpongeBob: Oh, yes, you will! We obviously can't fix your terrible insides, but maybe, just maybe, we can work on your terrible outsides. Makeover time!
[The scene changes back inside SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob gives Plankton a makeover and makes him look like a 1960s hippie. He gives him another makeover and makes him look like a 17th century judge. He gives him various makeovers and makes him look like a cowboy from the old west, a motorcycle gangster, and a cute little schoolgirl.]
Plankton: Brother.
[SpongeBob goes behind the changing curtain and changes himself to look like a high school girl. He puts Plankton in his pocket vest. SpongeBob looks at himself in the mirror. Plankton growls in anger and hops out of the pocket vest. He takes a bowling ball, puts it in the pocket vest, and sends SpongeBob crashing into a wall. The scene changes to them sitting on the sofa.]
Plankton: [takes off wig] Forget it, SpongeBob. Karen's the perfect woman: so smart, so conniving! Ah, she's never gonna take me back.
SpongeBob: Oh, yes, she is. You just need to do something big. Be vulnerable, be sweet. Show Karen your heart. [points to Plankton's chest]
Plankton: That's a great idea! I'll cook up a scheme to make her jealous and crush her spirit! [laughs but turns to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: That wasn't even close to what I said.
Plankton: Sure it was. And I know just how to do it. [mimics cat meow]
SpongeBob: Okay, I feel uncomfortable.
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket. Plankton is straightening out his bowtie and SpongeBob is in a handmade robot costume.]
SpongeBob: Plankton, are you sure about this?
Plankton: Of course I'm sure! Now, start doing a robot voice. Remember, you're not SpongeBob anymore; you're Shelby Naughtica.
SpongeBob: [in robot voice] Oh, I like that! [enters the Chum Bucket with Plankton] Boop beep! Beep boop boop!
Karen: Welcome to the Chum Bucket! [notices Plankton] Oh. It's you. What do you want?
Plankton: Yes, hello. I would like your most romantic table for myself and my beautiful date, Shelby Naughtica, the robot.
SpongeBob: Beep boop! [laughs robotically]
Karen: Hmm. [analyzes SpongeBob's costume] Mm-hmm. Shelby Naughtica, huh? Oh, what a beautiful name.
SpongeBob: Thank you! [gets kicked in the foot by Plankton] Ow! [in robot voice] I mean, thank you. Whoa! Beep boop beep bo boop!
[SpongeBob and Plankton sit at a table.]
Karen: I'll be right back with our lovers' special.
[Karen heads to the kitchen.]
Plankton: [laughs] This is going so great, SpongeBob! Karen is totally jealous!
[Karen comes back with a bucket of raw chum meat and a bucket of greasy nuts and bolts.]
Karen: Here we go. I whipped up a special batch of chum for you, and for your lovely robot date, a bucket of grease chock-full of nuts and bolts.
SpongeBob: Plankton, I don't want to eat this!
Plankton: Don't you ruin this for me, SpongeBoob, just eat it!
[Plankton and SpongeBob eat their meals as Karen confidently watches them. SpongeBob and Plankton swallow their food.]
Plankton: Ugh. [grabs SpongeBob's hand] Oh, my dear, Shelby Naughtica, you are the most beautiful woman I've ever laid my eye on!
SpongeBob: Oh, Plankton-poo, you say the sweetest things!
Karen: [scoffs] Oh, brother.
Plankton: I never knew what love was until I met you!
SpongeBob: Oh! You have made me the happiest girl robot in the world!
Karen: Hey, you! Get your hands off my man!
SpongeBob: You better step off, lady! No one can make Plankton happy like I can. We are soulmates, and we're going to get married and print 1,347 babies. [various papers of robot pictures fly out of SpongeBob's costume]
Plankton: 1,000 what??!
Karen: Oh, well, you're really in love. I won't stand in your way. Plankton's all yours.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Plankton: No! The whole point of this scheme was for me to get Karen back, and now you're ruining it!
SpongeBob: [takes off his costume] Sorry, Plankton. You just said nice things to me.
Karen: Wait a second. You're not just being a jerk? You mean, you cooked this whole stupid scheme up to win me back?
Plankton: Of course I did. [jumps on SpongeBob's head] I'd do anything for you, baby, even hang out with this moron.
SpongeBob: Oh, that is so sweet!
Karen: Get over here, you.
[Plankton kisses Karen's screen. Karen turns on the screensaver she showed him earlier in the episode.]
Plankton: Eww, it's that fat screensaver again.
Karen: [her screen becomes fire again] What?!
[Karen jumps onto Plankton and begins beating him up.]
Plankton: Now, Karen, take it easy!
SpongeBob: I'm gonna go now. [runs out of the Chum Bucket]
Karen: My motherboard was right about you! She warned me about you! And I should've listened to her!
[The Chum Bucket jumps up and down from the beatings inside. Plankton is thrown out again like he was earlier in the episode.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is marching around like a military drill sergeant while wearing a solider helmet.]
Mr. Krabs: Now, we all know what this day is.
SpongeBob: Today is the day when Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, sir! [continuously whacks Squidward with the mop while talking]
Squidward: [angrily] Like he does every day. [takes the mop from the scared SpongeBob who realizes his error]
Mr. Krabs: But this time, he's not going to catch me with me spatula down! [laughs] Ooh? [flips his spatula right side-up] SpongeBob, you're on guard duty, boy!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs! [hops in the mop wringer bucket and heads to the front door]
Squidward: And I'll go undercover. [grabs a pillow and a blanket and goes to sleep as usual]
[Mr. Krabs glares down at Squidward before hearing SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Hup, two, three, four! Hup, two, three, four! ♪Krabby Patties are the best! They'll put hair on your chest!♪
[A female customer looks into her dress and hair pops out.]
Female customer: [gasps] Oh!
French Narrator: Three hours later...
[SpongeBob is very tired from patrolling the front door.]
SpongeBob: [weakly] ♪Krabby Patties are the best... They'll put hairs...into your nest♪ [flops down to the floor]
[Squidward wakes up from his "undercover" and gets whacked with the mop.]
Squidward: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: [picks SpongeBob up] Any sign of Plankton?
SpongeBob: Uh, afraid not, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Maybe he's on vacation.
Mr. Krabs: Don't be silly! We always take our trips together, [his eyestalk enlarges at Squidward] to keep an eye on each other. What's taking that crook so long? [looks at his watch] Hm... Maybe the door is stuck. [oils the hinges on the door and sees a line of customers coming] Ah, for—these customers are blocking the way! [flips the road and sends the customers hurling into passing garbage truck; sighs] There we go. Nice, open path. [his path is nice and sparkly] Hm? Mm... Hey! Well, maybe he just needs a little incentive. [cuts to the Krusty Krab displaying the secret formula on a pillow; the sign blinkers the words "Secret Formula" with arrows pointing at it] There we go. [peaks over the cash register and looks at his watch; he slowly begins to worry] Maybe he doesn't want me formula anymore. [gasps as he sees the formula missing] He took the bait! We're going to red alert! [pushes the alarm button and the alarm goes off; the lights in the restaurant blink red and blue; then it covers itself with a protective shield and spins into the ground. Mr. Krabs peaks out of the ground through the telescope] Batten down the hatches! Furl the deck! Stop that greedy green goober!
[The customers moan and groan from all the spinning. SpongeBob runs around with a pile of bricks. He trips over Nat Peterson and sends the bricks flying to the window. Squidward dodges the bricks.]
Squidward: [sighs in relief but gets hit in the face with the brick] Ow.
[SpongeBob bends the kitchen door down, wraps it up and stuffs it in his head.]
Patrick: Doggone it! [shakes the bottle with the secret formula] Can I get some ketchup over here? Please?
Mr. Krabs: [slides down the rail while SpongeBob walks the dazed Squidward.]False alarm.
[The restaurant comes back out of the ground. The customers recover from the spinning and quickly run out due to motion sickness.]
Whistle: [blowing] Closing time!
[SpongeBob and Squidward remove their hats and prepare to go home. Mr. Krabs jumps in front of them, blocks the door and grabs his employees.]
Mr. Krabs: And just where do you think you two are going?
Squidward: [pulls himself free] It's customary to go home at closing time.
SpongeBob: Aren't you going home, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [puts SpongeBob down and laughs] Oh, I'm not budging. Plankton is gonna try something. I don't know when. I don't know where.
Squidward: Probably...here.
Mr. Krabs: Well, yeah. But when he does, I'll be waiting for him. [cackles and rubs his claws in a greedy motion]
[SpongeBob and Squidward exit the front door and quietly leave. Mr. Krabs turns off the light.]
Mr. Krabs: I'll be waiting right here.
French Narrator: The next morning...
SpongeBob: [enters the restaurant] Morning! Hm? [takes his hat while Squidward takes his] I guess Mr. Krabs went home after all.
Mr. Krabs: No, I'm still here... [reveals himself to be camouflaged to the floor] Waiting for that blasted Plankton!
[SpongeBob and Squidward become startled with Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs gets up. His eyestalks shrink to look like chameleon eyes and rolls away. The scene changes to Squidward trying to take a customer's order.]
Customer: Yeah, I'll take—
Mr. Krabs: [opens the customer's mouth] Me patty formula?! Huh? I knew it! You in there, Plankton?! [shakes the bones out of the customer's body]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, that's not Plankton!
[The customer's whole skeleton falls out of the body. Mr. Krabs drops the customer's body.]
Customer: [gets up and grabs his body, now angry] I will never set foot in this establishment again! [whacks Mr. Krabs with his skeleton foot for his actions] From now on, I'm using the drive-thru! [leaves]
[Mr. Krabs gasps and sees Mrs. Puff walking out with a Krabby Patty. He fishes Mrs. Puff with the fishing hook.]
Mr. Krabs: Aha! Trying to sneak a Krabby Patty to Plankton, eh? [takes the patty from Mrs. Puff]
Mrs. Puff: But, Eugene, it's just a to-go order.
Mr. Krabs: [mocking gibberish] Well, from now on, all patties are to be eaten on the premises! [sets Mrs. Puff down]
Squidward: What are you gonna do now, ban pockets?
Mr. Krabs: Capital idea, Mr. Squidward.
[Mr. Krabs uses a reef blower to steal money from a customer's pockets. It even sucked up his clothes. Mr. Krabs puts a barrel onto the customer's body.]
Mr. Krabs: There'll be a $50-a-barrel surcharge from now on! [sucks in more clothes and money with the reef blower and gives them more barrels; Old Man Walker is about to leave, but Mr. Krabs stops him] Whoa, hey, slow down there, Grandpa. Let me see here. [scans him with the scanner, removes his hat and reveals a stack of patties on his hat] Aha! Another one of Plankton's spies!
Old Man Walker: [nervously] I just wanted some for later.
Mr. Krabs: [violently stamps him with a "BANNED" stamper] You're banned! [kicks him out and sees a baby sucking on a Krabby Patty] Hm... So Plankton's recruiting baby burglars now! [removes the patty from the baby's mouth and the baby cries] Put a cork in it! [stuffs the baby's mouth with a cork and shoves both the baby and the mother in a barrel that says, "BANNED"] You're banned! [continues to violently stamp the customers with the "BANNED" stamper] You! You're banned! You're banned! Banned! [one customer's head gets a nasty bump from the stamper] Banned! [Tom's teeth say the word, "BANNED"; Mr. Krabs lifts his restaurant and bashes the customers away; he speaks through the Krusty Krab sign] You're all banned! [barricades the door while breathing heavily]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't think Plankton's coming.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense! [hears a knock at the door and gasps] See? It's that stinker Plankton now! What do you want?
Sandy: [off-screen] Uh...A Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: [Suspicious]Why?
Sandy: [off-screen] I'm hungry.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, that's just Sandy.
Mr. Krabs: [peeks through the hole and sees Sandy waving innocently] I'm not falling for it. [sticks his eyestalk through the hole and looks at Sandy] That's the worst squirrel suit I've ever seen. [shakes a spray can and sprays the word "BANNED" on Sandy's suit; gibbers as he begins to lose his sanity]
SpongeBob: [feeling a bit creeped out by Mr. Krabs' behavior; whispers to Squidward] Do you think Mr. Krabs is acting...strange?
[Mr. Krabs climbs up the ceiling, snaps his claws, and his mouth foams while he gibbers.]
Squidward: He seems fine to me.
SpongeBob: [whispers] Maybe we should postpone our plans for tonight.
Mr. Krabs: Plans?! Aha! You're both working for Plankton! Get out of me restaurant you tricky treacherous traitors! [violently stamps them with the "BANNED" stamper and sends them flying out of the restaurant]
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab chained and barricade. Mr. Krabs is hiding underneath the register boat while protecting the Krabby Patty formula. It appears that Mr. Krabs has completely lost his mind and is completely losing full sanity of himself.]
Mr. Krabs: I know you're in here, Plankton. Where are you hiding?
Plankton: [off-screen] I'm right here... [Mr. Krabs jumps out and sees the television on] at the Chum Bucket! Come on down and try our new Chum Nuggets.
Mr. Krabs: Heh. [turns off the television] Whew. [sees Plankton's shadow and gasps; he hides behind a pole; he looks and sees that is was only a cup with two straws] Oh. [chuckles] Just a—just a cup.
[Mr. Krabs hallucinates when he sees the cup transform into Plankton. Plankton laughs evilly and Mr. Krabs becomes scared. Everywhere he looks, he sees everything transform into various images of Plankton, laughing at Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs runs to escape, but no matter how he attempts to escape, all of the images of Plankton keep following him while laughing. Mr. Krabs crawls into a hole, which turns into Plankton's eyeball and reveals a red demonic version of Plankton holding the secret formula while laughing. Back in reality, Mr. Krabs is completely losing himself and screams. He runs to the bathroom and goes to wash his face at the sink.]
Mr. Krabs: [washes his face] Get ahold of yourself. Get ahold of yourself. [turns off the faucet and sighs] I'm starting to see things. [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs hallucinates as he is seeing his eyestalks transform into Plankton.He screams and gibbers. He runs up the pole with the formula and pops out from the ceiling. Just then, he notices something going on at the Chum Bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [pulls out a telescope and sees SpongeBob and Squidward entering the Chum Bucket] Those two are working for Plankton! [gasps as he sees Sandy, Mrs. Puff, Patrick, and Pearl enter the Chum Bucket]
Pearl: [bumps into the door] Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Me own daughter? [sheds a tear and sees Old Man Jenkins enter the Chum Bucket too] Oh, not Old Man Jenkins! [cries violently and goes back into the restaurant] Everyone really is out to get you. Aren't they, my little formula?
[Suddenly, the doorbell rings. Mr. Krabs goes up to the door and peaks through the hole. He sees SpongeBob standing out there.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? You have got to come with me to...[reads a note] the Chum Bucket for Plankton has kidnapped Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, so that's Plankton's evil plan? He wants me formula as ransom! What do we do? What? What's that? [leans in the bottle closely as if it was talking to him] Oh, that's just brilliant! Hold on a minute. I'll go get the ransom. [goes into the kitchen] Oh, you want a Krabby Patty, do you? Well, I'll give you a Krabby Patty. [laughs maniacally as he stuffs a variety of dangerous objects into the patties and cooks them on the grill; he makes a whole plateful of Krabby Patties; he goes to grab them, but they spark; Mr. Krabs checks them to see if they'll ignite, but nothing happens; he grabs the plate and laughs evilly; he kicks open the door] Okay, let's go rescue Squidward. [laughs]
[SpongeBob lifts the door up and appears to be flat. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk over to the Chum Bucket. They enter the restaurant and see Squidward tied up to a chair and gagged. Plankton appears on Squidward's head.]
Plankton: [giggles evilly] Surprised, Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Not at all, Sheldon. I knew you were up to something.
Plankton: Oh, yeah? How about now? [pulls out a remote and pushes the button]
[The lights turn on and all of Mr. Krabs' friends and family jump out.]
Everyone: Surprise!
[Mr. Krabs screams in surprise. He then becomes confused.]
Plankton: Oh, come, Krabs. It's the anniversary of the first time I tried to steal your Krabby Patty formula!
SpongeBob: [places a cake on top of Plankton] So, we threw you a surprise party.
Mr. Krabs: [teary-eyed] You mean you weren't working for Plankton?!
SpongeBob: Of course not, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [sheds a tear] Oh, I shouldn't have suspected you, SpongeBob! Whew. Won't need these anymore. [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs sets the plateful of Krabby Patties down and hugs SpongeBob. All of his friends and family members forgive Mr. Krabs for his actions.]
Patrick: Oh, boy, Krabby Patties! [grabs the plate]
Sandy: Yee-haw!
[Mr. Krabs sees them go to eat the tainted patties and screams. He knows what's gonna happen if they take a bite out of them. So, he rushes over to protect them all. Mrs. Puff goes to eat the patty.]
Mr. Krabs: No! Don't eat the patties! [snatches the patty from Mrs. Puff] Gotcha. [two jellyfish come out from the patty and sting his eyestalks]
[Mr. Krabs grabs the patty from Patrick who bites his hand. A foothold trap clamps down on his eyestalks. He screams in pain. He grabs the patty from Sandy, Squidward, and Old Man Jenkins.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew. [his destructive patties ignite and squirt tartar sauce on him] Ah, tartar sauce!
[The patties spin Mr. Krabs around and launch him into the air. The patties explode into a fireworks display, showing images of Mr. Krabs himself in pain. Everyone gazes at the spectacular fireworks display as if Mr. Krabs is putting on a show for them. Mr. Krabs comes back down and crashes onto the floor, completely burned.]
Mr. Krabs: [dizzy] Yay. [crumbles to ashes]
[It appears that Mr. Krabs got what he deserved for being a paranoid jerk, banning everyone from the restaurant, causing physical harm, and for letting his insane behavior put his own business in jeopardy. The scene changes to the aftermath of the anniversary party. Everyone exits the Chum Bucket and wave good-bye. But Squidward, on the other hand, is still tied to the chair as he hops along.]
Squidward: A little help here!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs leave the Chum Bucket. Mr. Krabs is now wrapped in bandages and is wearing a cast on his right arm.]
SpongeBob: Did you enjoy the surprise party, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, I'll tell you in a second. [turns SpongeBob around to see the Chum Bucket]
[Meanwhile, inside, Plankton chews through the cake and pops out the top.]
Plankton: [spits some cake out] Huh? [sees the formula] Ooh, that fool Krabs left the Krabby Patty formula behind! [knocks over the bottle, opens it and pulls the paper out; he sees a stick of dynamite flaring up in the bottle] Mommy.
[The dynamite explodes and destroys the Chum Bucket.]
SpongeBob: Ooh.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, boy-o. I enjoyed it very much. [laughs as the debris of the Chum Bucket fall from above]

Template:EpisodeTr/58b

[The scene opens up on a shot of the Krusty Krab]
Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the delicious Krabby Patty and its super-secret recipe. [Mr. Krabs appears]
Mr. Krabs: Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!
SpongeBob: [runs up] Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!
Squidward: [wakes up from behind the cash register; yawns] What's all the yelling about?
Mr. Krabs: Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula. [scene flashes back to Mr. Krabs and Plankton]
Plankton: Can I have the secret formula?
Mr. Krabs: No.
Plankton: Okay. [walks away]
Mr. Krabs: [voiceover] But he was persistent!
Plankton: [comes back] Pretty please?
Mr. Krabs: Uh-uh. [scene cuts to Plankton holding a costume behind his back]
Mr. Krabs: He used disguises! [Plankton laughs and pulls a cockroach costume over himself; Mr. Krabs squishes him] Super science! [Plankton drips a droplet of chemical into a test tube and drinks it; he is surrounded in a pink cloud and appears as a cockroach; Mr. Krabs steps on him again] Civil disobedience! [Plankton is marching, holding a picket sign that states "I am not a roach"; Mr. Krabs squashes him once more; scene cuts back to the Krusty Krab with Squidward, SpongeBob, and Mr. Krabs] And I always came out on top!
Squidward: [sarcastically] Fascinating.
Mr. Krabs: But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open! [Mr. Krabs' eyes bulge out, and he moves them right to left] You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.
Robot: [walks into the Krusty Krab, speaks in robotic voice] What a quaint restaurant. I think I will sample their wares.
SpongeBob: Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?
SpongeBob: With pleasure, sir![Runs off]
Mr. Krabs: [moves Squidward out of the way] I'll take this one. [to the robot] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?
Robot: Yes, please. I'd like an order of chili coral bits.
Mr. Krabs: [loses fake grin he had] You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?
Robot: No, thank you. [holds up dollar bill] Will this cover it?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, sure. [grabs dollar and hands the robot a paper bag] Here you go.
Robot: [takes the bag and walks toward the door; using green laser beams, it melts the doorway and walks through] Good day.
Mr. Krabs: Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good. [laughs; the dollar bill center pops open and Plankton jumps out]
Plankton: AHA!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!
Plankton: That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!
Mr. Krabs: Or what?
Plankton: ...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.
Mr. Krabs: Well, then, allow me to suggest your next move. [scene cuts to a toilet being flushed; Plankton screams in terror as he slowly gets sucked down into the toilet]
Plankton: Curse you, [scene cuts inside the water pipe with Plankton, gurgling on water] Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [he disappears into the hole]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] And now for the chaser. [scene cuts to manhole outside of the Chum Bucket; Plankton pops up out of the manhole, gasping for breath; he jumps out]
Plankton: You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands. [scene cuts to inside the Chum Bucket]
Karen: So? Tell me what happened.
Plankton: I don't want to talk about it.
Karen: Talking will make you feel better.
Plankton: Leave me alone.
Karen: That's your problem. You never let anyone in. Plankton the rock, Plankton the loner...
Plankton: And she's off, ladies and gentlemen.
Karen: You have to do everything yourself...
Karen: ...and that's why everything you try ends up like this... [Karen's screen shows Plankton laughing, about to pull a lever; Mr. Krabs crushes him] and like this... [Karen's screen shows Plankton laughing, holding a rubber duck over his head; Mr. Krabs simply smashes him again] and more recently, like this. [Karen's screen shows a toilet with a flushing noise.]
Plankton: [whimpering, starts bawling] I'm a failure!
Karen: It's not that bad! You just require a little help. Maybe some henchmen...
Plankton: Henchmen?
Karen: Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say.
Plankton: I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language! [scene cuts to a dim club with muscular tough guys playing pool; Plankton stands at the door] Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?
[Scene cuts to Plankton sitting in a wheelchair in the Chum Bucket with a cast and bandages]
Plankton: I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me.
Karen: Oh, come on. I think you're overreacting. [as Karen talks, a robotic hand comes out of a panel and pats Plankton, then crushes him] Sorry.
Plankton: That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea. [while Plankton talks, he "assembles" himself together, sticking his eye on, putting his arm in the socket, and matching his legs which are labeled "left leg" and "right leg" in their appropriate sockets] The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny! [he appears with a phone book and slams it on the ground] Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand! [scene cuts to Plankton "dialing" a number, which is him jumping on the buttons; cuts to Plankton running from the receiver of the phone to the speaker; cuts to Plankton writing a letter to a family member; cuts to Plankton running with his tongue moistening the adhesive on an envelope; cuts to Plankton in a red airplane, skywriting "CALLING ALL PLANKTON", but a fish sitting on a bench sneezes and blows away the skywriting; cuts to a montage of differently dressed Plankton] But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds! [doorbell rings] THEY'RE HERE! Welcome, brethren! [Plankton runs to the door and opens it with a big grin, which quickly fades into a look of disgust and disbelief; he sees a huge group of hick, redneck family members playing music; one of them begins to speak]
Clem: [hick drawl] Hey, look, everybody! It's cousin Plankton!
All: Yee-haw!
Plankton: I've been away from home longer than I thought. [Clem runs up and shakes Plankton's hand]
Clem: [hick drawl] Well, howdy, cousin! [Plankton stares at his hand, which is dripping after his cousin shook it]
Plankton: Uh...
Clem: It's me, Clem. O' course, you remember Zeke, Rufus, Jeke, Billy Billy Bo-Illy Bonana Fanna Fo-Filly, Doug, Enos... [Clem continues introducing the rest of the family; Plankton is crawling on the ground in exhaustion]... Fletcher McGee, Rainchild, Zeke Junior...
Plankton: Alright! I get it! ...I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home. [scene cuts to the family inside the Chum Bucket, standing in front of Karen] I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen.
Clem: [whistles from the back of the group] Golly, she sure is purdy, Sheldon.
Karen: Sheldon?!
Plankton: [annoyed] Yes, that's my first name. [Karen cracks up; Plankton keeps an angry face]
Karen: Sheldon? [laughing]
Plankton: [still has an annoyed face] Will you please-!
Karen: [still laughing] Sorry!
Plankton: All right, as I was saying... [Karen starts laughing] Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name.
Karen: [laughing] Okay, okay. I'm done. No more.
Plankton: Good. Ahem, to continue. [turns away from Karen; he doesn't see the screen that she brings down behind him; the word "SHELDON" appears on the screen] Only you can bring honor... [the family laughs; Plankton turns around to look at the screen; it is blank] ...and dignity... [the word "SHELDON" with a finger pointing at Plankton appears; the group laughs, and Plankton turns to look at the screen, which is now blank] ...back to the Plankton name. [as soon as Plankton speaks, another "SHELDON" sign appears with an arrow pointing at Plankton; he quickly turns around to look at the screen; which is now blank. Plankton is now trembling with fury; as he starts to speak, another "SHELDON" sign appears] For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for... [Plankton turns around and points at the sign] AHA! [he runs to the outlet and unplugs it] Okay, that's enough!
Karen:  Sheldon! Ha Ha! [Karen loses power; Plankton runs in front of Karen's screen]
Plankton: Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?

Family Member 1: But what's in it for us? [the family roars in agreement]
Plankton: Well, what do you want?
Family Member 2: Gawrsh. Can I get a new string for my banjo? [holds up a banjo with one string]
Family Member 3: And another boot to match this'n? [holds up foot with a boot on it]
Family Member 4: [holds up laptop] And some more memory for my laptop!
Clem: And what about root beer?
All: Root beer!?!?!
Plankton: Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink! [the group cheers] Victory, thy name is Plankton! [Plankton turns to face the cheering crowd; on his back is a note taped on with the word "Sheldon." The scene cuts to the Krusty Krab; Squidward and Mr. Krabs are at the register]
Mr. Krabs: Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for...
Plankton: [over megaphone] Attention, Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking.
Mr. Krabs: What?! [Plankton is standing outside the Krusty Krab with a megaphone]
Plankton: [over megaphone] I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab! [Mr. Krabs and Squidward run outside to Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, you and what army, bug?
Plankton: What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs! [scene pans out to show the Krusty Krab surrounded by something green]
Mr. Krabs: You planted grass?
Plankton: "Grass"?!? [Plankton laughs as his family joins him.]
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward run into the Krusty Krab with the Plankton family behind them; and a blackout, within the Krusty Krab are shaking and thudding noises, as if in a fight; scene cuts to Mr. Krabs' face] You'll never get away with it, Plankton. [Mr. Krabs is in the toilet, with only his head exposed, surrounded by Plankton]
Plankton: You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination. [laughs]
Plankton: Silence! [Plankton jumps on the flushing lever and sends Mr. Krabs spinning around] I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys? [Plankton snaps his finger and his family assembles into a giant human hand and ear; they twist the lock, figuring out the combination] That's it, a little to the left...
Mr. Krabs: Curse you, Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear! [the family opens the safe and inside is the secret formula in a bottle]
Plankton: Hot dog! [Plankton hops up the stairs to the formula] Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine! [Plankton pulls the cork from the bottle and smells it as if it were champagne; he pulls the formula out of the bottle] Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!
Family: [variously] Ahem.
Plankton: [notices his cousins annoyed by him not giving them credit] Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family. [goes back to Mr. Krabs, who is still stuck in the toilet]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.
Plankton: Begging won't help.
Mr. Krabs: I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.
Plankton: Eye.
Mr. Krabs: Eye.
Plankton: I don't care. Drum roll please! [Plankton rolls himself a snare drum roll on the snare drum, then runs to Mr. Krabs' office, where a book labeled "Recipe for a Krabby Patty" sits on Mr. Krabs' desk and cymbal crash is heard] Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good! [opens book] The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! Wait!
Plankton: [turns page] ...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!
Mr. Krabs: I'm warning ya...!
Plankton: [turns page] ...A cup of love...!
Mr. Krabs: Don't do it!
Plankton: ...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...! [turns page] ...Plankton?! [Plankton stares wide eyed at the formula and looks at Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: ...I warned ya.
Plankton: [screams while running all the way back home to the Chum Bucket]
[Back in the Krusty Krab, the book falls on the ground and the family reads the recipe and gasps; they all run screaming while Mr. Krabs laughs, except for Clem who just stands staring at the book]
Mr. Krabs: Hey. Why ain't you running?
Clem: Well, I can't read!
Mr. Krabs: Get out of here! [Clem runs away laughing goofily while Mr. Krabs gets himself out of the toilet; Squidward rubs his head and comes out of the toilet as well as he rubs his head; SpongeBob arrives]
SpongeBob: Hey, guys. Did I miss anything? [Squidward picks up the formula]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: Of course not! [He points to the Chum Bucket with his thumb] And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out. [Mr. Krabs starts laughing and hopping up and down]
Squidward: Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps and runs to his house, screaming] Curse you, Squidwaaaaaaaaard! [episode ends]



SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab is stowed and ready to slumber.
Mr. Krabs: Good job, laddy, another fruitful day pushing patties.
SpongeBob: Push-a-what?
Mr. Krabs: You know, turning patties into lettuce. [Bites a pickle]
SpongeBob: Uh, I'm not following you.
Mr. Krabs: Cabbage, green backs, money!
SpongeBob: Oh, you mean your obsession.
Mr. Krabs: Obsession is kind of a strong word. [opens the safe and puts the money to bed] Sleep tight, me little angels. [closes the safe and leaves with SpongeBob and turns out the light]
[Plankton climbs out of the pickle jar and opens a fake pickle, which contains a plunger launching device. He assembles it and shoots it at the wall above the safe, then climbs the rope, lowers himself onto the combination spinner and spins it by running on the top of the dial]
Plankton: 35 left, 25 right, and finally, 4 left. Open, says me! [pulls, but nothing happens] Hey, what gives? I was looking right at the combination, why isn't it opening?
Mr. Krabs: [Comes in] What's going on in here? Hmm, Everything seems to be in order. The safe is still safe. Huh, I must be hearing things. Hey, how'd that pickle end up on the floor? [picks Plankton up] Now, what was that rule about dropped food? Was it 5 seconds or 5 minutes or... ah, well. Waste not, whnt not.
Narrator: Approximately 10 hours later...
[In the Chum Bucket]
Karen: Plankton, where have you been?!
Plankton: Trust me, you do not want to know.
Karen: Did you get the Krabby Patty formula? Like I have to ask.
Plankton: No, and I probably never will.
Karen: You need a more positive outlook!
Plankton: Oh, Karen, if only you could just see things way I do. [Remembers when a fish, Sandy, and Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Patrick squished him by stepping on him]
Karen: [Gasps] Plankton!
Plankton: What?
Karen: I think you hit it! You couldn't see the correct combination because you have only one eye. You lack depth perception.
Plankton: Maybe you're right. That would explain why I stink at darts.
Karen: What you need is a second eye.
Plankton: Karen, my dear, I think you're on to something. Looks like it's time for an upgrade!
[Plankton presses a button. A machine covers him then retracts. An eye appears on the side of Plankton's head.]
Plankton: [eye appears] Success! [another eye grows] Uh oh, that ain't good. [even more eyes grows] No, no, no, no no no nо nо nо no! I can see every- [an eye grows inside of him and pops out of his mouth]
[Cut to Plankton screwing a brace onto his head]
Plankton: Binocular vision, here I come!  [presses the button again and an eye grows in the correct place this time. It grows legs] What? Oh mamma! Stop, I command you! [it begins to walk, firing a laser beam] Oh, come on, please stop! [Karen stops it] Next.
[Cut to Plankton hobbling about, injured]
Plankton: Karen, what am I doing wrong?
Karen: Your experiments are missing essential one ingredient.
Plankton: It's not love, is it? ‘Cause you know I hate that stuff.
Karen: No, it's cells from another eye. Even a single teardrop would contain enough DNA.
Plankton: Tears, huh? I guess if I have to. [Stabs his foot with a crutch and cries] Ow! Will these do?
Karen: No, silly. They have to be from somebody who already has two eyes.
Plankton: Two eyes, huh? I think I know a crybaby who fits that description!
[Cut to SpongeBob setting up a picnic]
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton!
Plankton: [jumps onto lunchbox] Hey, SpongeBob, want to hear a sad story?
SpongeBob: No, not particularly.
Plankton: Once upon a time, there was a yellow doofus who loved to drink milk with his lunch. But unfortunately for said doofus, his milk was tragically spilt.[Knocks the milk over] The end.
SpongeBob: [Starts to cry] S-s-s-sad story! And so timely! [SpongeBob cries uncontrollably, Plankton catches his tears in a bag]
Plankton: Get a grip!
SpongeBob: Well, I guess Plankton's right. Good thing I always bring backup milk! [Opens his face like a refrigerator and pulls out another carton of milk]
[bubble transition to Plankton tied to a table in his lab]
Karen: Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Plankton: Yes, let's hurry up and get it over with! [a needle lowers, fills with the tear sample then hovers above Plankton's eye] Mommy! Here comes the pain! [the needle drops some of the liquid onto Plankton's eye, then retracts] That wasn't so bad. Uh-oh, here we go. [his eye splits in two] Eureka!
Karen: So, does it work?
Plankton: You tell me. [Throws a dart and hits bullseye] Bullseye! Now for my next target – the Krabby Patty secret formula! [Leaves The Chum Bucket] Hahahaha! [skids to a halt] Wha-? [everything is bouncing and has a smiley face] Why does everything look so weir- ... look so beautiful?!
SpongeBob: La la la la!
Plankton: Hi, SpongeBob, great to see you, buddy!
SpongeBob: Hi, Plankton, whatcha doing?
Plankton: I thought I was going to steal something. Can't imagine why. So, I'm just enjoying this lovely day! [he skips away]
SpongeBob: Okay, buh-bye!
[Plankton walks back into the Chum Bucket with an ice cream and a balloon]
Plankton: Honey, I'm home!
Karen: Oh, you're a happy camper. Did you finally steal the formula?
Plankton: Formula, what formula? [Drops ice cream] I forgot the formula! I can't imagine what got into me.
Karen: It's that new eye of yours. Your evil DNA has become corrupted by SpongeBob's nice DNA. You've gone from evil.. To neevil! You're becoming as harmless as that fry cook.
Plankton: Nonsense, You're imagining things.
Karen: Oh, really? Let's test it, shall we? Tell me what you see in these ink blots. [Holds one up that looks like a bat]
Plankton: Hmm. Looks like a pretty butterfly!
Karen: Nope. Try again. What does this remind you of? [Picture of snake]
Plankton: Aww, it's a little puppy doggy!
Karen: Try this! [Picture of nuclear explosion]
Plankton: Uhh...
Karen: I'll give you a hint. [Makes explosion sound]
Plankton: A bouquet of flowers! Would you like some flowers, honey?
Karen: Cells from that sponge have changed your whole point of view.
Plankton: Ah, a few blobs of ink doesn't prove a thing. I'm as evil as ever, I'll prove it right now by stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula. [Runs outside]
[A building is on fire and citizens are screaming; Bubble Bass is trapped on the top floor, waving his arms]
Plankton: Such lovely destruction!
Bubble Bass: Help! Save me! [sips soda] Save me!
Plankton: I'll help you! Do not worry, citizen, I'll catch you!
Bubble Bass: Comin' down.
Plankton: Oh no. [Bubble Bass sits on him, squashing Plankton.]
Bubble Bass: Thanks, buddy!
Plankton: Unbelievable! I've committed another selfless act. This eye is taking over! But I must stay strong and concentrate on swiping the Krabby Patty formula. [A bottle rolls toward him] What's this? It's the Krabby Patty formula! Uh-wha.. Krabs must have lost it!
Mr. Krabs: [Standing at a bus stop with SpongeBob] And that's why your promotion means a 50% cut in salary, understand, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs! [Salutes]
Plankton: Hey, Eugene! You missing anything? [Holds out the formula]
Mr. Krabs: Me Krabby Patty Formula!
Plankton: That's right, Krabs. Unbelievably, I found it lying on the ground! [Laughs] So I'm giving it back to you, take it.
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Something smells and it isn't my long johns. [Takes formula back] Let's see here, you had the formula, why didn't you run off with it?
Plankton: Why didn't I run off with it? Why didn't I run off with it? Because that would be stealing!
Mr. Krabs: Since when do you care about stealing?
Plankton: Oh, it's this cursed new eye! I've got to get rid of it! Must become monocular again. [Tries to squeeze his eyes together] Hahaha, I did it! [They separate again. He tries to pull the eye off of his face, but he falls over.]
Mr. Krabs: You know, I don't think I trust this nice, polite, pleasant Plankton.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I think Plankton has really changed. He just needs some encouragement, and I know just how to do it!
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh. [Walks away]
[Plankton returns to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: My life of evil is over. [Tries to fix eyes] Hey, why is it so dark in here?
[Lights turn on to reveal a surprise party]
Everybody: Surprise!
Plankton: [Screams]The Chum Bucket's been invaded. I'll never surrender, never!
SpongeBob: [Laughs] This isn't an invasion, we're here to show you how much we appreciate all the good deeds you've done lately. We came to give a great big hug!
Plankton: What, no! Not hugs! [Plankton screams and they hug him and the new eye pops out and Plankton looks in a mirror] It's gone. That disgustingly good eye is finally gone! I'm cured! Thank you, thank you all! Especially you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hey, glad I could help.
Plankton: Yes, thanks to you I'm evil again, and as a token of my appreciation, I'll give you all a rousing send-off with my infra-red security attack lasers! [Presses a button and lasers start shooting. Everybody screams in terror and run away. Plankton laughs.] Oh, well. Depth perception's overrated anyway. [Turns to enter the lab, but walks into the door and falls over]


[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Order up! [holds a Krabby Patty]
Squidward: [takes the Krabby Patty to customer] Here. [drops Krabby Patty with plate on table]
Baby/Plankton: [pops up from bottom of the table] Goo!
Harold: [looks up from reading newspaper and sees baby across the table] Hey, there.
Baby/Plankton: [makes spitting noise with tongue] Num, num! [takes Krabby Patty]
Harold: Aw, does baby want a Krabby Patty, hmm?
Fish #2: Awww.
SpongeBob: [holding onto Squidward] Baby's first Krabby Patty. [sniffles]
[Baby walks out the door, holding the Krabby Patty. Security camera looks at baby. Alarms go off and Mr. Krabs is alerted in his office. Mr. Krabs looks through periscope in his office.]
Mr. Krabs: [sees Plankton controlling the baby from the inside] That diabolical fiend!
Plankton: [from inside the baby suit] I can't believe this is working! It's like taking candy from a baby — with a baby.
Mr. Krabs: [from his office door] Stop right there, you thievin' infant!
[Baby stops and turns head around. It makes mechanical squeaks, looks at Mr. Krabs and rotates its head back and continues towards the door. Mr. Krabs dives for the baby while screaming and body slams it. The baby then drops the Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Yi-eeh! That's harsh.
Mr. Krabs: So you thought you could pull a fast one, eh? [holds baby up by the diaper] Now, come out of there, you little pest! [spanks the baby while grunting]
Fish #3: [gasps] What's he doing? You leave that poor baby alone! [points at Mr. Krabs and the baby]
Mr. Krabs: Okay. I guess we're gonna have to do this the hard way. [holds up his claw]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, no! Don't do it! [holds up his hand to stop Mr. Krabs]
[Mr. Krabs grunts and rips the baby in half. The head lands on the ground.]
Harold: [covers his mouth] Ooh! Oh... [faints]
Fish #3: Oh! [faints]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, calm down! It's just Plankton. [squeezes the baby's body and Plankton pops out] See?
Plankton: Uh... goo-goo?
Fish #1: How dare you! You toyed with our emotions! [pointing at Plankton and pokes him in the eye]
Plankton: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Face it, Plankton. You're never gonna win. I'll always be one step... ahead. [holds up the baby head and puts it back on the body and chuckles, then takes the baby outside with Plankton in it.] Now, why don't you go back to where you came from, you little brat? [kicks the baby out]
[3 fish who were standing outside gasp.]
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh.
Three Fish: You monster! How dare you! [yell at Mr. Krabs and beat him up with an umbrella, a purse, and a walker]
[Baby lands at the Chum Bucket and start to cry.]
Karen: Aww, diddums failed to get a Krabby Patty again? [picks up the baby and brings it inside]
Plankton: [still in the baby costume] Stop patronizing me! Why does every single plan fall apart? It's just a stupid sandwich! I tell you, it's wearing me down!
Karen: You need to stop obsessing over it. [lays baby down and changes his diaper] Relax. Get a hobby or something. [tosses dirty diaper with Plankton in it in the diaper bin]
Plankton: I hate to admit it, computer wife, but you're probably right. I need something to take my mind off that blasted secret formula for a while. [walks out of garbage bin from a door at the bottom of the can; walks over to window facing the Krusty Krab] But what?
Karen: I know. How about taking care of an inferior life-form?
Plankton: You mean a pet? That's a great idea! But how will I find a pet that fits my dynamic personality?
SpongeBob: [looking through the window] Plankton! [Plankton screams] I have the perfect solution to your problem.
Plankton: SpongeBob? How could you possibly help me?
SpongeBob: You should try the local animal shelter. That's where I found my Gary.
Plankton: Oh, yeah? Perhaps you're on to something there.
[Scene then cuts to the animal shelter.]
SpongeBob: Here it is. The Bikini Bottom Animal Shelter. [pets barking] Your perfect pet awaits. Now, if you just listen to your heart, you'll be able to pick out the right pet as soon as you see it. [barking continues]
Plankton: Hmm. Too big. [walks by worms and snails] Too sloppy.
Patrick: Duh... [sits in cage]
Plankton: [walks by Patrick] Too stupid.
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. [stops] Oh! Oh! What about this one? [looks at a sentient rock with algae growing on top]
Plankton: Are you kidding me? Algae on a rock? I want a pet, not a plant. It's no use. [pet snarls] There's nothing for me here. [pet's tongue grabs Plankton and he screams]
SpongeBob: Oh, no! Plankton!
Plankton: You know, I can't say I'm surprised.
[Barking noises are heard coming from another animal, which turns out to be an amoeba. The amoeba growls and chomps the pet holding Plankton. The pet that was holding Plankton screams and lets go.]
Plankton: [while amoeba continues to bark] Hey there, little guy. [pet barks and jumps into Plankton's arms] Looks like we have a winner!
SpongeBob: Oh, so cute! Whatcha gonna call him? He looks like a "Spot" to me.
[Pet chomps SpongeBob's finger and growls.]
Plankton: That name provokes a violent reaction. Spot it is!
[Spot licks Plankton, then barks and pants. Scene cuts to the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: Well, Spot, I'm your new owner, so shower me with love and affection. [Spot just sits quietly] Karen, it's not giving me unconditional love. I think it's defective.
Karen: You're gonna have to train him to do that.
Plankton: I train him? [sighs] I'll give it a shot. All right, Spot. Let's start with something easy. Stay. [picks up Spot and sits him down] Good boy. Now sit. [squishing noise of Spot sitting] Very good! Now roll over. [Spot barks] Excellent! Now shake. [Spot shakes his body, shaking the whole building] Wow! That's one mean shake you got there. I think we should burn off some of that extra energy. Would you like to go walkies? [holds up leash; Spot releases bubbles] I'll assume that's a yes. [put collar and leash on Spot] March! [Spot barks and begins walking as Plankton whistles; moments pass and Plankton starts getting tired and pants] Phew. We must've walked for miles. [notices he's only made it to the mailbox] I guess our legs are too short for walkies. How about a nice round of fetch? [brings back tennis ball and grunts] Fetch! [tennis ball lands on top of Spot and squishes him; Plankton screams] Oh no. What have I done? I'm a terrible pet owner! Terrible! Karen! We're gonna need another Spot! [Spot squishes himself back together and pops up from the ground, barking] Nice rebound, Spot! You know, I get squished a lot too. [sniffles and Spot licks him] I hope nobody saw that emotional outburst.
[Group of 3 fish standing near Plankton.]
Three Fish: Aww!
Plankton: Shoo!
[The three fish walk away. Scene then cuts back to the Chum Bucket, indoors.]
Plankton: Okay, Spot. Today, you'll learn how to be an attack pet to guard the Chum Bucket from intruders. Now, Spot, pretend I'm a burglar. [Plankton is seen wearing an animal costume] Attack! [Spot whimpers] You're not getting this? Come at me! Uh-oh... losing balance! [loses balance and falls over] A little help? [Spot jumps on Plankton and licks him] On second thought, what do I need a guard dog for? I can't even give chum away. What I really need is a retriever. [Plankton now showing Spot a picture of a Krabby Patty] This is your target. I want you to retrieve the Krabby Patty. Now, security is tight, so I've devised a pl-- [Spot walks away. Plankton flips to next page of plan with a picture of the Krusty Krab on it] Wait! Where are you going? You're not ready!
[Spot is seen sniffing around, then he opens the Chum Bucket door and leaves. He pops through Krusty Krab's front door, still sniffing around. He walks by Squidward at the cash register. SpongeBob walks out of the kitchen humming cheerfully. Spot goes into the kitchen.]
Fish #1: I'd like a large... [sees moving Krabby Patty on the ground] What was that?
Squidward: Didn't see it, don't care.
[Back at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is seen snoring and drooling. Spot drops Krabby Patty in front of Plankton and barks at him.]
Plankton: Holy plot twist! It's a Krabby Patty! It's... a miracle! [heavenly choir singing] Karen, look at what Spot brought home!
Karen: That's wonderful! Spot deserves a reward.
Plankton: He can have anything he wants, up to half my kingdom – uh, laboratory.
Karen: I think he wants your Krabby Patty.
[Spot pants and chomps the entire Krabby Patty.]
Plankton: [screaming] No! No! You've been a very bad amoeba! Bad amoeba! I'm afraid you'll have to be punished! You need a time out. I'm just gonna tie you up out here until you learn to behave! [ties Spot to mailbox] Shouldn't take more than five minutes. [Spot whimpers] Aww... no, no, I must be strong! [Spot whimpers as Plankton goes back into the Chum Bucket] I can't do it! [opens the door] Spot, I'm sorry! I — [sees the collar on the ground] Spot! He's gone! [crying] Where is he? Spot! Come back! [sobbing] Spot! Come back! Spot! Come back! I've got to find him!
[Group of 3 fish is back.]
Three Fish: Awww!
Plankton: Don't any of you have jobs? [searches for Spot] Spot! Spot! Where are you, Spot? [sobs at the Krusty Krab dumpster]
SpongeBob: [walks out of the Krusty Krab, holding a garbage bag] Why, Plankton, what's wrong? [dumps trash]
Plankton: I lost Spot.
SpongeBob: That's terrible! Gary lost me once. [shivers] I was cold, alone, starving. It was the worst eight minutes of my life. Come on, Plankton, let's find your pet. [picks up Plankton and tucks him under his arm]
[Plankton is now looking out from being tucked in SpongeBob's pants while they look for Spot in downtown Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: Lost pet! Anyone seen this lost pet? [holds up sign that reads "Have you seen this amoeba?" with a green speck on it] Lost pet emergency! Be on the lookout for a lost pet! Pardon me, sir. [stops man in suit] Have you seen this amoeba?
Fish #2: You mean that little speck?
SpongeBob: No. That little speck. [points to another speck on the sign]
Fish #2: Is this him? [holds up shoe]
Plankton: No, that's a piece of gum.
Fish #2: Gum? [pulls gum off] I've been looking everywhere for this! [puts it in mouth and chews it] If I was lookin' for a lost pet, I'd try the animal shelter.
Plankton: Of course!
SpongeBob and Plankton: The shelter!
[Both SpongeBob and Plankton head to the animal shelter.]
SpongeBob: I think it's closed for the night. [opens the door and it clanks] Ooh, it's dark in here. I'll find a light switch. Aha! [flips a switch and metal clanks are heard] Nope, that's not it. [flips another switch] Aha! Found the lights.
Plankton: Uh, SpongeBob? What was the first switch for?
SpongeBob: I don't know. I think it unlocks the pens?
Plankton: I thought so. Because now the animals are loose! [animals growl]  SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Run for it?
Plankton: Yep.
[SpongeBob picks up Plankton and runs away. Animals growl and chase them.]
SpongeBob: I think we lost 'em.
Plankton: SpongeBob, before we're torn to shreds, I'd like to thank you for helping me look for Spot.
SpongeBob: Aw, it was nothing. Hey, speaking of Spot. Did you always have a double pupil?
Plankton: A double what? [pulls a speck off of his eye] Spot! [dramatic music plays] Thank entropy you're safe! You were hiding on my optical cornea the whole time! You sneaky little amoeba, you. [Spot barks and licks Plankton; Plankton laughs]
SpongeBob: Aw, I'm glad you found Spot. [animals growl] Unfortunately, the animals found us too.
Plankton: Good-bye, Spot. I guess this is the end of the road for us. [Spot growls, barks, and jumps out of Plankton's arms] Spot, no!
[Spot barks at the other animals, who laugh at him. Spot snarls and grows to a much larger size and he growls loudly at the other animals. They all run away back into their cages and the cages close. Spot growls and shrinks back to his original size, then he jumps back into Plankton's arms.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Spot! You saved us!
Plankton: I taught him everything he knows! [Spot barks and licks Plankton]


[episode starts at the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is grumbling]
Plankton: What is going on here?! [screams, and rips off some of his skin, then Karen comes out]
Karen: What's wrong now?
Plankton: Same as always, look, empty again!
Karen: So what are you gonna do about it?
Plankton: I don't know anymore! [cries]
Karen: Hey, hey, hey, why don't you just work on a new recipe?
Plankton: What's the point? I haven't had a customer in years! [Nat walks in]
Nat: Hello!
Plankton: Away with you! Can't you see that I'm self-loathing here?
Nat: Sorry, I just wanted a Chum Stick.
Plankton: [eye pops out in shock] What?!
Nat: Yes, I'd like one of your Chum Sticks.
Plankton: You're kidding right?
Nat: No, I'm serious, I want a Chum Stick.
Plankton: Uh, okay if you insist. [hands him a Chum Stick, and Nat eats it] Oh, no, please don't sue me! [Nat finishes the whole thing and says: Mmm-mmm!] I can't believe someone actually enjoys my chum! [laughs]
Nat: Now this was so good, I'm going to have to come back tomorrow. [hands him a dollar] Here you go. See you in the morning.
Plankton: [to Karen] Did you see that? I didn't even have to threaten his life! He loved it!
Karen: How'd you pull that off?
Plankton: Well it's simple, finally someone came in who has good taste. And he's coming back tomorrow! Excuse me, Karen, but I've gotta whip up some more. [cuts to the next day, Plankton comes running out of the Kitchen with a Chum Stick] Now, I wait. I wait until he returns. [hops up on a stool, and stares out the window] I wait. I wait. I wait. I wait.
Narrator: 8 hours later... [Plankton is asleep, then the clock wakes him up]
Plankton: Huh? Nat? Hello? Huh? What? [sees the clock] Uh, it's closing time. I should have known it was too good to be true.
Nat: Hey!
Plankton: Well, hello, Nat!
Nat: I came back like I said yesterday.
Plankton: You certainly did, didn't you?
Nat: I'd like another Chum Stick, please.
Plankton: Well, it's your lucky day, Nat. I happen to have a quite delectable one, right here.
Nat: Oh, boy! [eats it]
Plankton: Is it okay?
Nat: [angry] Okay?! [happy] It's perfection! [both laugh, and then do a high five] Hey, how about I have another?
Plankton: You betcha! [gives Nat another one, and he eats it]
Nat: Whoo, boy! I cannot believe how good these things are.
Plankton: Oh, well, you know.
Nat: All right, see you tomorrow. [hand him another dollar]
Plankton: What?! You're coming back again?
Nat: Oh, you know it! And the day after that, and the next week after that! You've got a regular customer on your hands! [walks out]
Plankton: Oh, my, this is amazing! At last, I've got my revenge! [laughs evilly, then cuts to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is laughing]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Rolling, rolling, rolling! Money keeps on rolling along!♪ [playing bowling with money] One more time! [notices Plankton] No way, Plankton! You're not getting me formula this time or any time! [throws him on the counter, then gets a spoon, and crushes him]
Plankton: Don't bother. There's no need.
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about?
Plankton: [slides out of the spoon] I'm just saying I no longer need to copy you, Krabs. I've got my own winning recipe now.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] You're really funny man! You think you can compete with me? Look Plankton, look at all these loyal customers. Loyal to me, Plankton, not to you!
Nat: Hey, Plankton, can I get another one of your delicious Chum Sticks?
Plankton: But of course, loyal customer. [hops out of Mr. Krabs' hands, onto Nat's hand] I'll see you later, loser. Much later! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no! How can this be? Boy, front and center!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir!
Mr. Krabs: Plankton's trying to overthrow me business! He's got a customer that actually likes his food! You've gotta get that guy back on our side with a couple of Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: Oh, you can count on me, sir. [cuts to Nat walking toward the Chum Bucket] Pardon me, you smart fellow. Down here. [SpongeBob is laying on the floor, like a mat] Why settle for Plankton's lumpy chum, when you can enjoy a steaming Krabby Patty for free?
Nat: [sniffs it, shakes in disgust] No thanks. [opens the door, peeling off SpongeBob's skin]
SpongeBob: Barnacles! [cuts to SpongeBob in a chair] There he is. Just in time for breakfast. [SpongeBob walks down the street, then throws a rock on the ground] Oh, I am such a clumsy oaf. I sure hope nothing happens to this Krabby Patty while I step carefully over this rock here. [deliberately trips over the rock] Oh, no! Too late! No! No! [tries to shove in his mouth, but his mouth dodges every time] Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Come on, Nat. Just one accidental bite! I see you're not hungry right now, but I'm telling you, that Krabby Patty is gonna make a great snack later.
Nat: Yeah, do me a favor. [rips off SpongeBob's pants, uses it as a napkin, then gives it back] From now on, keep those Shabby Patties to yourself. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Oh, fishpaste! [cuts to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: Nat, back all ready? That's the fifth time today. Not that I'm surprised. Karen, babe, fetch Nat another plate of that sweet chum.
Karen: Yes, Your Diminutiveness. [goes in the kitchen]
Plankton: Say, Nat, do you have any friends?
Nat: Nope. [Plankton sings a little, then laughs]
Plankton: Would you hurry up with that chum, Karen?!
SpongeBob: [imitating Karen] Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep your tiny pants on Plankton, bleep bloop. [throws a Krabby Patty] There's your chum, bleep blap blop.
Nat: Hey, this doesn't look like chum.
Plankton: And that doesn't look like Karen! [SpongeBob looks like Karen]
SpongeBob: Why, don't be ridiculous, my husband, bleep blap. Of course it's me.
Plankton: What have you done with Karen, you brute?! [cut to the kitchen, where Karen is taped up]
Nat: How many times do I have to tell you? [throws the Krabby Patty away] I don't want to eat your trash! Plankton's chum is my favorite breakfast, lunch, and dinner! I love chum! So forget it! I don't want to eat anything else! [SpongeBob returns to normal, and speaks in normal voice]
SpongeBob: So you're saying that you love chum? And all that you ever eat is chum?
Nat: Yeah! Th-that's right!
SpongeBob: Interesting. [walks away, scene then cuts to Nat walking out of a trailer. He notices a hole with a sign that says "Shortcut 2 Chum Bucket"]
Nat: A shortcut to the Chum Bucket? Hmm. That must be for me. [whistles as he goes through the hole, and it leads to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Welcome, valued customer!
Nat: This isn't the Chum Bucket.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Why go to the Chum Bucket when the Krusty Krab has added tasty chum to our menu?
Nat: That's okay, I only eat Chum Bucket brand chum.
Mr. Krabs: But we've developed a special recipe for the most discerning chum lovers. Besides, I locked all the exits until you give it a try. So what do you say? [Nat eats it, then spits it out] You like it?
Nat: It's...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah?
Nat: It's... [coughs]
Mr. Krabs: Well, what do you think?
Nat: It's the second foulest thing I've ever tasted! [vomits in a sick and angry mood off screen] I'm going back to Plankton's chum. [crawls away]
Mr. Krabs: What am I going to do?! I can't let Plankton have so much as one single customer! [cries] I just can't afford it!
SpongeBob: I guess you'll have to make Chum that's as good as Plankton's.
Mr. Krabs: But to do that, I need to know how Plankton makes his Chum. [gets an idea] That's it boyo! [cuts to the Chum Bucket at night time. Mr. Krabs sneaks over and uses a flamethrower to cut his way through the Chum Bucket metal wall, allowing him to get inside] Where could it be? [notices the safe] There! Plankton's secret formula! [tries to open it] It's gotta be in here... [an alarm goes off, and he gets crushed by a giant spoon]
Plankton: [laughs] What do you think Krabs, baby? This time I caught you trying to steal my secret formula! Ironic, isn't it?
Mr. Krabs: Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing. You see, crabs are not born with an innate inkling of irony.
Plankton: Ouch, double irony! [SpongeBob picks him up]
SpongeBob: Triple irony, Plankton! Though you nabbed Krabs trying to steal your formula, I'm still here to foil your evil plans! So, it's like a dollop of irony on top of an ironic twist. [Plankton groans] I mean, just think about that. [presses a button on his remote] You know, in a weird way, it's like we never left the... [SpongeBob gets crushed by a giant spoon]
Plankton: Good thing I sprang for the dual spoon installation.
Karen: Call it a computer's intuition, but I sense your regular approaching, with an unusually large wad of cash.
Mr. Krabs: Look at all that loot!
Plankton: That's right, Krabs! And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my chum!
Mr. Krabs: D'oh, just put me out of me misery! [Nat walks in, angered]
Plankton: Back for more of my delicious chum, I see!
Nat: Not this time.
Plankton and Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Nat: [to Karen] Not ever again! [throws all the money at Karen's computer screen] The deal's off, computer! I can't eat another bite of that slop, no matter how much you pay me!
Plankton: Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?
Nat: I have eaten ten of those things, and I've all ready had to go to the doctor...twice! [groans in pain and stumbles backwards, falling to the ground, then Joe and his co-worker put him on a medical bed] If you need me, I'll be getting my stomach pumped, again. [they carry him out]
Plankton: What's the deal, Karen?
Karen: The deal was that I paid Nat to eat your chum, so you'd quit your constant complaining.
Plankton: All this time, I never had one regular customer?
Karen: Duh.
Plankton: Should have known! Why would anyone ever eat my slop?
Karen: Uhh, there he goes again. Cut it out, Plankton!
Plankton: What? It's just obvious that I'm a complete failure, and a waste of a lower life form! Oh, woe is me! [cries]
SpongeBob: Quickly, now is the time to beat a hasty retreat!
Mr. Krabs: What? And miss this? I've never enjoyed meself more! This irony's pretty good stuff! [laughs]


[SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the Palace of Pranks.]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, here it is, the Palace of Pranks, the greatest novelty shop in Bikini Bottom. All the greatest pranksters shop here. This is where I got my gag seanut brittle can. [The scene shows a close up of the can of Seanut Brittle.]
Patrick: Oh, boy, Seanut Brittle - gimmie!
[Patrick tries to open the can.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember?
Patrick: Nice try, SquarePants, but it's not gonna work this time. I'm gonna have some of your delicious Seanut Brittle! [he opens the can and purple tubes pop out of the can] Where's the Seanut Brittle?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick. Come on, let's go inside.
[SpongeBob walks off screen.]
Patrick: [starting to cry] Seanut Brittle?
[SpongeBob enters the Palace of Pranks and smells the air.]
SpongeBob: Ah! [Patrick enters the scene.] Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items. [An aisle is shown.] Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see! [He walks down an aisle.] Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?
Patrick: [in another aisle] Hey, Seanut Brittle! [Purple tubes appear popping above the aisle that Patrick is in.] Oh, darn it, not again!
[The scene only shows SpongeBob in his aisle. SpongeBob laughs. An old fish named Frank enters the scene.]
Frank: Good to see you, SpongeBob. How's my number one customer doing?
SpongeBob: Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster, too.
Frank: [Walking up to Patrick] Well, pleasure to meet you, Patrick. [shakes Patrick's hand, but Frank has a joy buzzer, so it shocks Patrick. Patrick screams and sucks on his hand. Frank laughs.] That's your first lesson, son, the granddaddy of all pranks. The joy buzzer.
Patrick: I don't get it.
Frank: You don't have to get it. The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster.
SpongeBob: You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him.[SpongeBob and Patrick walk to the checkout counter and Frank is behind it.] Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got.
Frank: Well, this came in just this morning. [shows package of gum] Have some gum. [Patrick chews the gum but then he screams as his head explodes.] Ha! Exploding chewing gum. Only $9.95.
Patrick: [His head is gone, leaving a neck bone in the shape of a femur] I don't get it.
SpongeBob: [takes out a dollar.] What can we get for one dollar?
Frank: One dollar will get you this fake gag dollar - [He takes out a fake dollar] fool your friends into thinking you've got a real dollar.
SpongeBob: What else have you got?
[Frank holds up a whoopee cushion.]
Frank: A whoopee cushion.
SpongeBob: Nah.
[Frank holds up fake vomit.]
Frank: Fake vomit.
SpongeBob: No.
[Part of the counter is covered in real vomit.]
Frank: Real vomit?
SpongeBob: Eugghh. Don't you have anything good?
Frank: Well, there is one prank that I've been saving for a real top of the line prankster. [Shows close up of spray can] Invisible Spray!
SpongeBob: Wow, invisible spray!
Patrick: But I can see it.
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this.
[SpongeBob gives Frank some money.]
Frank: Good choice. Now be careful with that stuff, boys. It stains clothes.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Frank. [SpongeBob and Patrick walk off-screen. The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Patrick outside.] Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray.
Patrick: What are we gonna do with it?
SpongeBob: I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair.
[They both think about sitting on an invisible bench, surrounded by Nat, Tom, Tina-Fran, Horace, Halber, and Shelia.]
Nat: They're floating in midair!
Tina-Fran: How do they do that?
[The thought bubble disappears.]
Patrick: That's the ultimate prank! Good idea, SpongeBob!
[Patrick gives SpongeBob a thumbs up.]
SpongeBob: Well, let's get started.
[Patrick takes off his shorts.]
Patrick: Okay, I'm ready.
[Patrick drops his pants on the ground.]
SpongeBob: Any particular reason you took your pants off?
Patrick: Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?
SpongeBob: That it does, Patrick, that it does. Good thinking. Here, hold this a second. [Patrick takes the can of spray while SpongeBob takes off his pants. Patrick hugs the can.] Okay, Patrick, give me the can.
Patrick: I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea.
Patrick: Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!
SpongeBob: Give me that thing.
[SpongeBob grabs the can and he and Patrick wrestle over it. SpongeBob accidentally sprays their clothes and they disappear]
Patrick: Hey, the invisible spray works!
[A tour bus drives up.]
Tom: And on your right, if you look, you'll see two naked guys fighting over a can of paint!
[The passengers laugh and Tom laugh. The bus drives off. SpongeBob covers his lower half]
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!
[SpongeBob pats the ground, trying to grab the clothes. Patrick sprays SpongeBob's right hand and it disappears]
Patrick: I gotta hand it to you, SpongeBob. You look kinda funny.
[Patrick laughs and SpongeBob screams.]
SpongeBob: Righty, where are you? [Patrick laughs again.] No one messes with Righty! [He takes the spray can with his invisible hand.] We'll see how you like it! [sprays Patrick making a hole in the middle of his body] Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?
[Patrick takes the can.]
Patrick: Yeah. [He sprays SpongeBob's upper left corner.] I see what you mean.
[SpongeBob takes the spray can and sprays Patrick's lower half.]
SpongeBob: No guts, no glory! [laughs]
Narrator: Several bad puns later...
[The scene returns to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are now invisible. Patrick shakes the can.]
Patrick: Oh, hey, I think this thing is empty.
[SpongeBob grabs the can and shakes it.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no, it can't be! How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank? Thanks a lot, Patrick. You used the last of it.
[SpongeBob throws the can far away.]
Patrick: Hey, I think I found our pants. [A ripping noise is heard.] Oops! Here, these are yours.
SpongeBob: Oh, forget the pants, Patrick. Let's get home and wash this paint off.
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk off somewhere.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, do you know what time it is?
SpongeBob: Oh sure, it's...half past invisible.
Patrick: Gee, it's getting late.
[They walk up behind Nat.]
SpongeBob: Let's ask this guy. Excuse me, sir, but do you have the time?
Nat: Sure. [looks at his watch] It's, uh, ten to three.
SpongeBob: Thank you.
Nat: Don't mention it.
[Nat turns around to notice there is seemingly no one there.]
Patrick: Don't mention what?
Nat: Uh, who said that?
Patrick: Me.
Nat: AHHH! GHOSTS!
[Nat runs away from them; his eyes pop out]
Nat's eyes: Aaahhh!! [Nat's eyes jump into a car and drive away]
Patrick: Hey! I'm no ghost. The nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs.
SpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea.
Patrick: Lay it on me.
SpongeBob: Okay, we're invisible, right?
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom. Oh, it's the ultimate prank.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoo! High five!
[They give each other a high five]
SpongeBob: Let's go scare us some suckers.
[The scene changes to show Sandy's treedome. The scene then shows her reading a book in a rocking chair in her tree. She hears a noise, which is SpongeBob and Patrick's laughter. She checks to see what it is, but there is supposedly nothing there. She gets up and goes to her window.]
Sandy: Huh? [the outside of her tree is shown.] Well, that's funny. I thought I heard voices. Huh? [She walks up to a glass of juice on the floor.] I thought I left that glass of peanut juice on the table. [She walks over to a table with a lamp covered in garbage.] And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday? And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?!
[Photos of Patrick are on the walls and tables, the rug has his face on them. Sandy turns around and sees SpongeBob and Patrick covered in white sheets over their heads as they wail.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're ghoooosts.
[SpongeBob and Patrick wail again. Sandy laughs.]
Sandy: I knew it was you guys! Alright, joke's over. Take off the sheets. [She pulls off the sheets and notices there is nothing there. She gasps.] It is ghosts!
[Sandy screams. She takes out a remote with a large red button. She pressed the button and an escape pod that is in the shape of an acorn appears out of some panels. She enters the escape pod and presses a button. The escape pod flies out of her dome, above the water, past the Bikini Bottom island, and lands in Texas. The escape pod explodes in Texas. SpongeBob and Patrick leave Sandy's house, laughing.]
SpongeBob: Boy, we really scared her!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: Who's gonna be our next victim?
SpongeBob: A better question would be, "who isn't?"
[The scene changes to show Mrs. Puff's house, where she is preparing to eat a piece of cake.]
Mrs. Puff: Double-dark deep-sea light diet cake! [laughs] You will soon be mine. [Patrick and possibly SpongeBob eats/eat the cake, making it look like ghosts have eaten it. Patrick's face is covered in cake. He belches loudly and wipes it off.] Oh! [gets filled up with air and then lets it out flying all around] GHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSTS!!!!!
[Her deflated body lands on the table. The scene changes to show Squidward painting and humming to himself at his house. SpongeBob and/or Patrick takes the paintbrush, making it look like it is floating in mid air.]
Squidward: Huh?
[SpongeBob and/or Patrick paint(s) a mustache under Squidward's nose. The two wail ghostly. Squidward crashes through the wall and runs away.]
Squidward: GHOSTS!!! 
[The scene changes to show Bill surfing at Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob and Patrick surf up to Bill, making it look like a surfboard is on a wave by itself.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Speaking in ghostly voices] COWaAaBuuUUnggaAAaaAaaAA!!!
Bill: GHOSTS! AHHH!
[Bill slips off the board.]
[Gale appears waving her arms wildly.]
Gale: Ghosts!
[Fred appears with his eyes bugging out of his head.]
Fred: Ghosts!
[Lonnie appears, scared with arms on his head.]
Lonnie: Ghosts!
[Francis appears in a sort of screaming position.]
Francis: Ghosts!
[Sandals appears holding a piece of toast.]
Sandals: Toast.
[Harold appears sitting on the toilet, appearing freaked out.]
Harold: Ghosts!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are reading newspapers. SpongeBob laughs.]
SpongeBob: It's official - we're the greatest pranksters ever. The whole town thinks we're ghosts.
[Patrick is holding his newspaper upside down]
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom-- [An article is shown it reads, "Krabs Last To Be Haunted! says, 'I ain't afraid of no ghosts'"] Mr. Krabs.
[The same article is shown on Patrick's paper, but it is upside down.]
Patrick: It says he isn't scared of ghosts.
[SpongeBob is "shown"]
SpongeBob: We'll see about that!
[The scene changes to show the Krusty Krab at night. Mr. Krabs peers out of the blinds.]
Mr. Krabs: Ghosts? Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts. Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief... [grabs a handkerchief] And his dried-up sea leprechaun. [shows ashes of the sea leprechaun] And a bit of gold never hurt. [shows a gold necklace around Mr. Krabs neck that reads, "Foxy"] But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot! [his underwear is strung up with rope] Got me shivering timber brace, [shows his ankles chained together] and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down! [a strip of duct tape covers the hair. Mr. Krabs is shown wearing a barrel and a headpiece with lanterns hung on it.] And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor... and if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weapon—the specter deflector! [holds up a paddle ball] So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on! 
[The lights black turn off. SpongeBob and Patrick wail ghostly.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [As they open the front door] KraaaAAAAbBBbsss!
Mr. Krabs: Wha? 
[SpongeBob and Patrick toss over a table and barrel. They pick up a barrel and a table to make it look like they are floating.]
SpongeBob: Krabs, we've come to haunt yooOOOOuuUUUuuu!
[Mr. Krabs uses the specter detector (paddle ball) by bouncing the stringed ball back and forth from the paddle board.]
Mr. Krabs: Stay back, I'm well-armed!
[SpongeBob and Patrick moan ghostly. SpongeBob and Patrick walk by with a barrel, making it look like it is floating by. Mr. Krabs hits the ball faster.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm warning ya!
[SpongeBob and Patrick moan. SpongeBob or Patrick stops the ball. SpongeBob or Patrick then cuts the string.]
Mr. Krabs: [shivering] Ooh!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [quietly] Boo.
[Mr. Krabs breaks out of his armor and shrieks hysterically.]
Mr. Krabs: I gotta get out of here!
[He runs to the doors, but they don't open.]
SpongeBob: You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut.
[The door is held closed with a long strip of glue. The scene shows the side of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] You'll never get me!
[Mr. Krabs tries to break through the window, but instead of shattering, the window stretches like elastic and slingshots him backwards, and he crashes into a table]
Patrick: Nice try, Krabs, but we've replaced all the glass with rubber!
[Mr. Krabs dives into the toilet, but gets stuck. He pulls himself out and sits on the floor, dazed]
SpongeBob: Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets. [The toilet is stuffed with toilet paper. Mr. Krabs cowers in a corner.]
Mr. Krabs: Please, spirits, leave me be.
[Patrick laughs.]
Patrick: [while Mr. Krabs is incoherently begging for his life] We got him good, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs is incoherently begging for his life] Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea. [to Mr. Krabs] You're going to pay, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [shaking with fear] No, spirits, please! 
SpongeBob: Pay!
[a dollar floats in the air]
Mr. Krabs: No!
SpongeBob: [high-picthed] PaaAAAAyyYYyyy! [lights a match]
Mr. Krabs: NOOOO!!!!! Don't burn me dollar! [He takes a bucket of water and throws it at the dollar. The water drips on SpongeBob and Patrick, making them reappear. They laugh, not noticing they're visible.] Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick!
SpongeBob: [wiggling his arms and legs like a ghost] I know not these names of which you speak.
[Patrick looks down and notices that he is visible.]
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, we're visible again. [SpongeBob looks down, then he and Patrick scream and cover their lower halves. Mr. Krabs lifts them up by the back of their necks as they try to run.]
Mr. Krabs: So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts?
SpongeBob: We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em.
[Mr. Krabs puts them down.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me. [They all laugh.] Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?
SpongeBob: Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes.
[Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened.
Patrick: Me too.
Mr. Krabs: Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now. You two pranksters better get going.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport.
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] Don't mention it.
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk into the dining area.]
SpongeBob: That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me. What a guy!
Patrick: Yeah!
[A white, round light shines on SpongeBob and Patrick. The scene pans out to show a crowd of people consisting of: Tom, Bill, Mrs. Puff, Sandy, Squidward, Horace, Harold, Nathiel Waters, the red shirt Frank, Jimmy-Gus, Sadie, Nat, Nazz-Mimi, Purple Scooter, Dennis Rechid, Martin, an anchovy, two Frankie Billys, Clay, and Franco.]
Mr. Krabs: The Krusty Krab presents: LIVE NUDE PRANKSTERS! [He is shown shining the light on them from the crow's nest] Starring the "Bikini Bottom Ghosts"!
[Nat, Sadie, Harold, Martin, Abigail Marge, and Frank are shown cheering. SpongeBob and Patrick scream while trying to cover themselves up. Mr. Krabs laughs teasingly. Sandy whistles at them as Mrs. Puff takes a picture. Squidward laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick keep trying to cover themselves.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: We should have bought the whoopee cushion!


Sandy: [Sandy rakes a pile of leaves in the shape of Texas] There we go! SpongeBob, I got all the leaves ra... [steps on piles of leaves still on the ground] SpongeBob, what are all these leaves doing here? You said you were going to rake them!
SpongeBob: [peeks his head out of a pile of leaves he is in] I am raking the leaves.
Sandy: But they're still all over the ground!
SpongeBob: Sandy, I can't rake any faster. [picks up a leaf and starts scraping it with a tiny rake] These are big leaves. [leaf breaks into more pieces] And they keep breaking into more leaves.
Sandy: [Sandy pushes him away and rakes them herself] Then go scrape the salt lick or somethin'! We got to get this stuff done before it's too late!
SpongeBob: What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?
Sandy: [hanging laundry] I told ya, SpongeBob... [scrubs the birdbath with a toothbrush] I'm hibernating next week.
SpongeBob: Hibernating? What's that?
Sandy: [painting the fence] It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter.
SpongeBob: Can I do that?
Sandy: [chuckles] No, silly. It's a mammalian thing. [paints over SpongeBob's helmet]
SpongeBob: Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.
Sandy: [cleaning her exercise wheel] Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!
SpongeBob: Why, Sandy? When does your... "carburation" begin? [Sandy jumps down, pulling down a giant calendar with a giant x on the 8th]
Sandy: In one week!
SpongeBob: But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3... [gasps] 168 more hours of playtime!
Sandy: You're telling me. And there's still so much stuff to do! We gotta climb some things!
SpongeBob: Climb!
Sandy: We gotta jump off of stuff!
SpongeBob: Jump!
Sandy: We gotta ride!
SpongeBob: Ride!
Sandy: I don't wanna go to sleep yet!
SpongeBob: Wait, Sandy! [Sandy begins to cry]
Sandy: I can't burn carbs in my sleep!
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: What?!
SpongeBob: Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you. [Pantera playing]
Sandy: Well, I'm glad, SpongeBob, 'cause for the next seven days, it's gonna be you, me, and these sweatbands! [holds them up. Cut to the giant sand mountains area. Sandy is riding a giant clam shell smashing through a sign] Yee-ha! [sliding down the mountain so fast she is now on fire. She rides past a fish with a backpack on his back. When she goes past him, he drops to the ground and rolls around cause he is on fire. She then rides past a man and a woman. The woman now wears a jogging outfit and the man is now riding a tricycle and holding a lollipop and paddleball. The woman looks at him]
Unnamed Fish #1: Uh... I can explain. [Sandy flips in mid-air, still on fire]
Sandy: I'm hotter than a hickory-smoked sausage! Woo-hoo! [SpongeBob is wearing his green karate head gear and riding down the mountain on his tongue. Cut to two kids, building a sandman]
Girl: Maybe, if we sing that song, he'll come to life.
Billy: Ready?
Both: [singing] Oh, there once was a sandman... [SpongeBob rides into the sandman. a musical note pops up]
SpongeBob: Life's as extreme as you want to make it! [jumps off the mountain] Whoo!
Girl: Maybe we didn't sing it right. [SpongeBob is flying toward the ground. When he hits it, two bones are sticking out]
SpongeBob: Yeahhh... [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob standing outside Sandy's treedome] Whew, what a workout. [pulls out his right arm and shows its damages] I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow. [his arm falls to the ground] Ow.
Sandy: I got to say, I'm impressed with you, SpongeBob. You're making this the best prehibernation week ever.
SpongeBob: Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again. [sighs as he lifts up his left leg and moves it alternately with the other over to his house. Later, it's nighttime and he is finally crawling into bed] Good night, Gary. [falls asleep. Then Sandy pushes a button which launches SpongeBob out of his bed and into a lake. SpongeBob is now a block of ice. Sandy jumps in and becomes a block of ice]
Sandy: Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [shivering] W-what h-happened to s-sleeping? [Sandy pulls down a calendar]
Sandy: I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun. [swims away] Well, hurry now! The giant clams like to feed at this hour! [cut to SpongeBob lifting a bowling ball into a tube. Sandy blows her whistle giving the signal and SpongeBob runs to the end and picks up a few jacks before the bowling ball hits him on his head. Sandy does the same thing but the bowling ball cracks her helmet] Isn't this GREAT?!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I've never played extreme jacks before! [cut to Sandy and SpongeBob with giant q-tips]
Sandy: Okay, SpongeBob, this one's going to be fun! We just whack each other with these giant ear cleaners 'til one of us falls off! [lifts hers up] On your mark... get set...
SpongeBob: Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?
Sandy: Go! [hits SpongeBob off the Sea Needle. SpongeBob lands on a fire hydrant. Sandy rides up on a two-seated bike] Come on, SpongeBob, we're goin' for a tandem ride through the park!
SpongeBob: Gee, that sounds safe!...I mean, fun. [gets up but leaves a piece of himself on the fire hydrant. He jumps on the bike] Okay, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy?
Sandy: I did, SpongeBob: the industrial park! [they ride into a giant factory] This is where the real action is! [Sandy pedals on barbed wire] This part gets pretty technical! Yee-haw! Now for the speed course. Hold on! [they ride through a conveyor belt with a giant crunching mouth at the end] I hope we make it! [bike begins to fall to the ground fast. SpongeBob screams] I'm havin' fun, too! [as they hit the ground, SpongeBob melts into a puddle. Sandy tosses a fishing rod on him] Wake up, slowpoke! [scene scrolls over to show a plane] We're going fly-fishin'! [rimshot]
SpongeBob: [thinking] This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle! [sees his shoe floating] Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something.
Sandy: What is it?
SpongeBob: Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of... [his mouth melts away from his eyes. He pulls it back up] I just feel like maybe I need to... [his mouth melts away again. Sandy puts her hand over his mouth]
Sandy: Hold that thought, SpongeBob! 'Cause it's time for a down-home favorite! [holds up a piece of hay. Pantera plays again] Find the hay in the needle stack! [throws it in a giant pile of needles]
SpongeBob: [bites his fingers in fear. Cut to inside the needle pile] Ow-ow, ow-ow-ow! [he gets pricked by the needles. One needle pricks his nose, causing it to deflate like a balloon. Deep voice] ...OUCH.
Sandy: Did you find it?
SpongeBob: Not yet.
Sandy: Well I'm going to look over here!
SpongeBob: You do that. [SpongeBob digs a hole underground then emerges]
Sandy: Found it, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs away] Come on! Best two out of three.
SpongeBob: Gotta hide! Uh-G-Gotta hide! [looks at his house] Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret. [looks at Patrick's rock] Under a rock? It's so original! [as he jumps for the rock, his pants get stuck on a small coral bush]
Sandy: SpongeBob?! [SpongeBob struggles to get free and eventually does, but leaves his pants stuck on the plant] SpongeBob? [Sandy walks up to SpongeBob's pants] Where are you, little square dude? [gasps] SpongeBob's tie! And all his other little dressin's! But-but he always folds his clothes before running around IN THE NUUUDE! Something terrible must have happened to him! [crunching and munching] Alright, listen up, y'all! I'm rounding up a search party! SpongeBob's gone missing! [Squidward smiles at Mr. Krabs, thinking that Mr. Krabs will not look for SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs gives Squidward an angry look.]
Mr. Krabs: [Squidward frowns because they will search for SpongeBob] Man the lifeboats!
Sandy: Alpha Team, you search uptown, Gold Team searches downtown. Any questions?
Frank: Gold Team rules!
Sandy: Now get movin'! [crowd yelling. Fred put a Lost poster with a picture of SpongeBob] SpongeBob? [Cuts to Sandy and the search party] Someone look up there! [Sandy pops out of a sewer] Put your doors, and friends into it! [cut to searching in the sulfur fields] Come on! He could be anywhere in these sulfur fields! [Clay looks in a spout]
Clay: Hey, SpongeBo-ob! [a blast of sulfur hits him in the face] …Well, at least I still have my personality.
Sandy: Check in this here moist cave! [Old Man Jenkins, Nathaniel and Scooter walk in shouting for SpongeBob then run out, realizing the cave is actually a three-eyed sea elephant]
Sandy: Status report!
Small Fish: [covered in Poison Sea Urchins] He's not at the Poison Sea Urchin cove...
Sandy: Well, look again!
Vera: [covered in leeches] He's not at the leech farm!
Sandy: Well, look again!
Squidward: He's not in my thoughts.
Sandy: Well, THINK AGAIN! [cut to Sandy talking into a megaphone] Attention, Bikini Bottom, the time has come to double, no, triple our efforts!
Squidward: How about a break? We've been at it for days!
Gale: Think about the children!
Sandy: That's a good idea! Use the children to crawl into small places you couldn't normally reach.
Frank: [whispering to Sadie] This is a load of barnacles...
Sandy: I heard that! No one's going anywhere until we find SpongeBob!!
Frank: Uh... uh, wait! [picks up Francis] Uh, here he is!
Sandy: That ain't SpongeBob! SpongeBob is square!
[Frank shapes Francis into a square]
Francis:  [in a poor imitation of SpongeBob] "I'm ready, I'm ready"?
Sandy: No you ain't! [Clay holds up a box of Kelp-O]
Clay: I found SquareBob!
Sandy: That's just a cereal box. Besides, he's yellow.
Charlie: [holds up a banana] Uh... here he is! Hey, can I go home now? [Sandy becomes annoyed]
Tina: [points up] Oh, look! He's up in the sky! [Sandy happily looks up, but SpongeBob's not in the sky]
Sandy: He's not...huh? [everyone is gone] They must have gone to search some more. [Sandy continues searching for SpongeBob] SpongeBob, where are you?! [lifts up a house] You under there?! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house where the unnamed fish from before is at]
Unnamed Fish #1: Uhh, I can explain.
Sandy: [lifts up another house] SpongeBob?! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house] Nope! [lifts up another house] Nope! SPONGEBOB!!!! WHERE ARE YOU!?!?!?!
Unnamed Fish #9: [everyone is looking at Sandy] That squirrel's gone crazy.
Woman: But she'll never look under a rock.
SpongeBob: Ahahaha, you said it! Sandy'll never find us! [everyone glares at SpongeBob and throws him out] Hey, wait, you don't understand!
Squidward: [pops out from under the rock] "Oh, look! It is I, SpongeBob, out here in the open!" [Sandy turns around]
Sandy: SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: [in horror] AAAAAHHH! C'MON, LET ME BACK IN! You don't understand! [Sandy hugs SpongeBob]
Sandy: Oh, SpongeBob, I was so worried! I thought something terrible happened! [grabs his arm] Come on! There's just enough time to go atom smashing! [Sandy runs but SpongeBob is not moving]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait!
Sandy: There's no time to wait!! HIBERNATION!! [pulls on SpongeBob's arm]
SpongeBob: Sandy, you've got to make time! This is important! [Sandy lets go of SpongeBob's arm] I...am a man! [holds up a razor] Okay, Sandy, I...I...I-I-I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU ANYMORE! I JUST CAN'T TAKE THE GAMES!! THEY'RE TEARING ME APART!!! [rips off his nose and throws it on the ground, then holds onto Sandy's legs crying] There, I said it! Now just promise we can still be friends. Please, Sandy? This isn't easy, I...
[He notices Sandy has fallen asleep]
SpongeBob: Sandy? [chuckles a little] I never thought I'd say it, but thank Neptune for hibernation! [laughs and falls asleep]
Patrick: [returning home with groceries and an ice cream] WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?!?!


Sandy: [looking at the clouds] You know, SpongeBob, sometimes, it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by.
SpongeBob: Yup, and just relax.
Sandy: Yeah. Relax.
SpongeBob: OOOH! Ooh-ooh-ooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
Sandy: What?
SpongeBob: A flower.
Sandy: They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time.
SpongeBob: They sure do.
Sandy: You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty.
SpongeBob: Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
Sandy: Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
SpongeBob and Sandy: [both laugh] Me.
SpongeBob: That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.
Sandy: Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See? [points to her acorn patch]
SpongeBob: I thought that meant you were nuts.
Sandy: Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby. And if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength! [his fingers flex] What do you say to that, "Miss Mittens"?
Sandy: I'd say I'm already halfway there!
SpongeBob: Aaaaah! [begins to climb the mountain] No fair, Sandy! You got a head start!
Sandy: Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles! [collapses the rock SpongeBob is climbing on]
SpongeBob: Hey! [gets back on another rock] You did that on purpose!
Sandy: Yeah, but this is an accident! [unleashes more rocks at him]
SpongeBob: [screams] Aaaaahhhhhhh!!
Sandy: Too bad you forgot your umbrella!
SpongeBob: [holds on to an umbrella and floats up] ♪ I didn't! ♪ [laughing, reaches the top of the cliff]
Sandy: [sitting in a lounge chair, reading a newspaper] Well, it's about time you showed up.
SpongeBob: But you were... I saw you by the... I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
Sandy: Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter.
SpongeBob: I can underwater! I'm... [Low voice] Hydrodynamically designed! [Normal voice] Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
Sandy: Why don't you ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you say to that, HydroPants?
SpongeBob: I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there! [zooms out to reveal a record player] -halfway there!-halfway there!
Sandy: [gasps] Hey!
SpongeBob: [running at the bottom of the mountain, laughing, hits a brick wall]
Sandy: [jumps on SpongeBob's face and over the brick wall] Thanks for the face lift! [runs into the Krusty Krab, laughing] You see? I told ya you didn't have a chan-
SpongeBob: [dressed as an old man] There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature [licks lips] waiting! [rips off suit, laughing]
Sandy: I thought y'all wanted a rematch.
SpongeBob: I did! And I took a head start like you did!
Sandy: Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!
SpongeBob: I guess we don't, air breather!
Sandy: Water sucker!
SpongeBob: Tree climber!
Sandy: Gulf streamer!
SpongeBob: Kite flier!
Sandy: Chum chewer!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Take that back! You- [nervously] not wet person!
Sandy: Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!
SpongeBob: Proves what?
Sandy: That land critters are better than sea critters!
Patrick: [walks to the two] Better at what?
Sandy Cheeks: Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!
Squidward: [walks to the three] What's she blabbering about?
Patrick: She says land creatures are best.
Sandy: Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur styling and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking [Mr. Krabs joins the four] and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs all gasp]
Sandy: And name calling, for sure!
Squidward: And drowning, don't forget drowning!
SpongeBob: [laughing] Good one, Squidward! [jumps to high five Squidward, but freezes in midair] Woo!
Squidward: Not on your life, sport. [SpongeBob falls]
SpongeBob: I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel. [SpongeBob and the rest except Sandy start laughing until SpongeBob signals them to stop] But you're still just a land creature.
Sandy: Squirrels can do anything they want to!
Patrick: I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite. [gulps a big patty down] Ah.
Sandy: [reaches offscreen for the same big patty] Give me that. They don't call me cheeks for nothin'. [tries to eat it, but it splatters on her air helmet. Everyone, but Sandy and Patrick, begins to laugh]
Patrick: Thank you, thank you.
Sandy: Well, that's just one thing.
Mr. Krabs: Can you do this? [pops his eyestalks in and out of his head] Everyone in my family can do that.
Sandy: [Tries to do it] Uh...uh...
Squidward: How about this? [balances six spinning plates on a stick with his tentacles] Huh?
SpongeBob: Can you reproduce by budding? [begins to do it] Can ya? Can ya? Huh? Can ya?
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: Most importantly, can you do this!? [all except Sandy make their eyes big and round, and begin gasping three times without releasing any breath]
Sandy: Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?
SpongeBob: Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if it wasn't for that suit, you couldn't even live down here! [everyone but Sandy starts laughing]
Sandy: Well, you don't... [all continue laughing] I don't need to... [all laughing harder] Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit! [rips off suit, and all gasp] And I don't need this helmet neither! [throws helmet to ground, releasing an air bubble]
Mr. Krabs: Neptune preserve her!
Squidward: How long can she stay like that?
SpongeBob: I don't know!
Patrick: Sandy's a girl?!
SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe... [he, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs chuckle while Sandy winks] Yep, won't be long now. [she starts struggling to hold her breath] Feelin' light-headed yet?
Sandy: Mm-mm. [Sandy shakes her head]
SpongeBob: Remember this? [SpongeBob takes a deep breath in and out]
Mr. Krabs: It's free! [also takes a deep breath in and out]
Sandy: [Starts suffocating underwater. Screen shows her insides where her lungs shrivel and her left lung breaks and falls off. She suffocates, looks around, runs to the counter, and quickly digs through multiple objects, then puts her head into a pickle jar and breathes heavily. All the others start laughing] Stop laughing at me!
Mr. Krabs: I knew it! There was no way some "airhead" was gonna win anything against a water breather!
Patrick: Airhead... [laughs. The top of his head deflates like a balloon] Huh? [puts thumb in mouth and blows. His head becomes round at the top]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water!
Sandy: All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya?! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!
Squidward: Do we have to wear pickle jars? [All, except Sandy, laugh]
Sandy: Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs.
SpongeBob: One minute? No problem, Landy! [All but Sandy begin to laugh]
Sandy: [all but her are still laughing, as she leads them all to an island rising out of the water from the seafloor, as they see the island, they stop laughing] Well? So are you going or not?
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stammering] Uh, well, uh, uh, um...
SpongeBob: Actually, you know, but...
Squidward: We can't, uh...because...
Mr. Krabs: We're late for, um...
Patrick: Our fitting!
Sandy: Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes?
Patrick: [holding and eating popcorn] Hey! We are not chicken! [drops popcorn] Huh! My popcorn! [begins pecking at it like a chicken]
SpongeBob: Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it. [looks at the water's surface and pokes his finger above the water] There. Mission accomplished.
Sandy: Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!
SpongeBob: No way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!
Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: We're not afraid of your dumb old land!
Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: We're sea creatures!
SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Okay... Well, this is it.
Mr. Krabs: Wait, boy, [gives him a glass of water] ...make it last.
SpongeBob: [drinks from it] Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay. [gulps hard, and starts running] Here I go! [gasps out of real water; he's now a real yellow kitchen sponge on a stick; he breathes heavily] Hey! This isn't so bad! [proceeds up to the real island] We can do this. Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!
Patrick: I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball! [jumps up out of the water. He's now a real pink starfish, missing his pants, on a stick] Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: All right, Pat, you made it!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here! [cut back to Squidward and Mr. Krabs left in the water]
Mr. Krabs: All ashore that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! [runs up] Land-ho! [he is a red rubber toy crab on a stick]
SpongeBob: Lookin' good, Mr. Krabs!
Patrick: Oh, yeah! Woohoo!
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward, you're missin' all the dry! Come on, Squidward!
SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs: [chanting] Squid-ward! Squid-ward! Squid-ward!
Squidward: [walking up] Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it.
SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs: [chanting] Squid-ward! Squid-ward! Squid-ward! Squid... [they stop chanting after Squidward walks up. He's a puppet octopus with his eyes and big, bulbous nose]
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: Well, here we are! [all four are walking on the island]
Squidward: This is pretty easy.
Patrick: I may keep a second rock up here.
Mr. Krabs: Once you get your land legs, it's not so bad!
SpongeBob: We're the masters of land and sea! [a string puppet seagull lands in front of them] Hey! It's a local. Hi! We're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks? [seagull looks towards the screen]
Sandy: 3. 2. 1. Well, tan my fur! They made it! Better go congratulate 'em. [walks onto the island. She's now a real plush squirrel toy with a small, round plastic helmet on her head] SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to? [we now see two seagulls terrorizing SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Patrick. One seagull has Patrick in it's mouth, the other is chasing around SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward. Sandy sees them and gasps.] Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! HI-YA! [she runs off camera and we hear karate noises and see feathers flying. She briefly backs into the camera's view, then runs off to fight again. All five sink back down to the seabed, with Squidward upside-down.]
SpongeBob: Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy.
Sandy: You know, everyone's best at something.
SpongeBob: But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy.
Sandy: Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!
All: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
All: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip!
Seagulls: [lying injured on the island with their feathers missing] Hooray.


Mrs. Puff: Okay, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment. [class groans]
SpongeBob: [leans towards Nat] Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
Mrs. Puff: Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight. [class groans again]
SpongeBob: [Again leaning towards Nat] Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
Mrs. Puff: In no less than 800 words. [squeals and class groans again]
Nat: [acting like SpongeBob] Did you hear that? 800 words!
SpongeBob: Yeah, I know! [Nat frowns]
Mrs. Puff: Due tomorrow. And remember class: work hard and no goofing off.
[back at SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is [holds up a pencil] the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm... funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink. [kisses the pencil as little hearts fly out of it] Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay. [looks at window, it's colorful outside] Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go! [SpongeBob's clock is shown. Several hours pass and has still only written 8 words] Gee, this is harder than I thought... [SpongeBob looks outside where everyone is having fun]
Patrick: [applies lotion on Sandy] Come on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob goes back to his desk]
SpongeBob: It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license! [a live-action drag race is shown. a car hits a wall, tumbles and gets back up] Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only 6 o'clock. Okay, okay here we go, here we go. [struggles to write] I know, I just need to get blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics? [SpongeBob does calisthenics. While doing it, he recites "Hup Hoo" several times, his nose and eyelashes do it too.]
SpongeBob:  I can feel those juices pumpin' now! [moves his chair closer to the table. he does it a lot because of the fun noise it makes. He then laughs] Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper! [pushes his chair in] Come on, pencil, make words.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How’s my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What do you mean you're not hungry?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary. [Grabs Gary by his shell and pours some food he takes up a ladder and fills it to ceiling-level] I've got to make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite. [Gary quickly eats it] Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some crème brulée? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits? [steps on Gary's food] Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen. [cleans it up using himself as a mop] Hmmm... I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage. [cut to SpongeBob, who has already finished] Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long... and it's only... 10 o'clock?! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written! [Begins active writing] I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah... yeah... yeah! And some of these, and some of these... Almost there and... [finishes writing. The pencil is steaming due to the excess force] done. Now lets see how it looks so far. "The-" [shows he has only written "the" in fancy lettering] Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go... thinks SpongeBob think! [looks at the telephone. Cut to Patrick in bed, snoring. The phone rings and he wakes up]
Patrick: Who is that? [picks up phone] Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, whatchya up to?
Patrick: Sleeping.
SpongeBob: That's really fascinating, are you having a good sleep? Any dreams you'd like to discuss? I remember on the...
Patrick: SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.
SpongeBob: [gasps] That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!
Patrick: Well, I'm listening.
SpongeBob: Uh... Marco!
Patrick: Polo! [hangs up]
SpongeBob: Yeah, well I gotta get going Patrick, got an important essay to write? [hangs up phone] Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy? [back to his desk with eraser shavings on his paper] I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! [swats the shavings away but they float above the paper] Now they're floating around my thinking space. [blows them away] So long, pesky particles! [the shavings float back to SpongeBob. As he struggles to remove the shavings, he swallows one in the process] I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water! [goes to the kitchen and drinks water] That was a close one.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What do you mean 'overly dramatic', Gary? [rubs his tummy] All that choking sure made me hungry.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary. I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see... White or rye bread... or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese [doorbell rings] A visitor? For me!? [SpongeBob opens the door to meet Norton the Mailfish] Hello! 
Norton: Package for Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Great thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?
Norton: It puts bread on the table.
SpongeBob: Rye or pumpernickel? [laughs]
Norton: Oh, brother..
SpongeBob: So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...
Norton: Don't you have a paper to write? [He walks away]
SpongeBob: [Gulps and zooms in on his face] How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay? [blipping his eyes and slides back into his house]
Johnny Elaine: In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off. [head sticks out TV] When will he learn?
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [karate chops the TV causing a zap and glass breaking. lights a candle]
Chair: Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat, put your feet up and relax.
SpongeBob: [gasps and a bell rings and drops the candle that went out and the clock lights up] Oh no! Midnight! [runs through the hallway of clocks and the alarms ring on the walls] Must... get... back to desk! [runs to the table, but it has enlarged. he jumps up on the chair] Whew, that was a close call. [his pants are missing] Ah! My pants!
Pants: Yoo hoo! Down here!
SpongeBob: You get up here! I've got to get back to work!
Pants: [runs out of SpongeBob's Pineapple to the door] Freedom!
SpongeBob: [runs out the door] Stop Pants, you get back here this instant! Paaants... [door closes, SpongeBob yelps, then tries to get back in, but it is locked. looks in the window. The candle is still lighting. The clock spins, breaks, and comes to life]
Clock: [ghostly voice] Time's up, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [gasps as the candle comes to life]
Fire Wick: Only 799 words to go! [laughs sinisterly as he burns the essay]
SpongeBob: No! [the fire wick burns his entire pineapple. He screams] What have I done?! [SpongeBob runs around his house, yelling] Help! Help! My house is on fire! [continues running around his burning house until it comes to life]
House: SpongeBob, why? Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob? Why didn't you just write your essay? Stop wasting time!
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Where's my essay! Oh, there you are! [laughs] I must have dozed off. [grabs his paper from his head] Lets see where are we? [holding his paper with a word "The" is still there, puts the paper down on the desk] Do I dare look at the clock... [slowly looks at the clock and gasps] It's almost 9 o' clock! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes? How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight! [Writing] And making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep... [cut to SpongeBob running to the boating school] Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is! [goes inside, but nobody is there] Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?
Mrs. Puff: Oh, there you are SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em.
Mrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you... I have to go to a teacher's convention!
SpongeBob: But what about my essay?
Mrs. Puff: I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!
[SpongeBob rips his essay. He then rips himself]


[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs pops out of the front door and sniffs around.]
Mr. Krabs: Nope. Nothing. [walks back in] I can't smell a cent or a dollar. Or any money in a 5-mile radius. We might as well settle down early. [Squidward squeals in joy. Mr. Krabs points to Dennis at his table] Just as soon as that guy finishes his meal.
Squidward: You mean the guy who's been nursing a single fry for the last hour?
Mr. Krabs: When he goes, you can go. [Mr. Krabs walks off as Squidward bashes his head on the register in disgust.]
Squidward: Grr! [Squidward walks up to Dennis who is sucking on his French fry] Excuse me, sir. But you seem to be having trouble masticating. Here let me help you. [Squidward shoves the French fry in Dennis' mouth and makes him chew it until he swallows it. Dennis gets up and leaves.] What? No tip? Finally! Yes! [walks out the door] Leaving early! I can't believe this is finally happening! [Suddenly, the sky turns black and rain starts to pour. The wind blows the flags off the Krusty Krab. A bolt of lightning strikes the Krusty Krab sign and the shell breaks off. The wind blows a bulldozer and breaks the sign pole off the ground. Then lightning strikes Squidward, leaving him barbecued. Squidward runs back into the restaurant.] Cause it's not.
Mr. Krabs: Oh my! That's quite a storm! You know, a storm like this puts me in the mind of me old navy days.
SpongeBob: Old navy days?! Ohh!
Mr. Krabs: That gives me a fine idea, SpongeBob. Since it looks we're gonna be stuck here for a while, why don't you pull up a barrel, me laddies? While I retell you a thrillin' tale of me mysterious salty past. [Squidward, who is barbecued from the storm, turns to dust. Then it cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward sitting at a table as Mr. Krabs brings a bowl.] There, now. The lights are properly dimmed. [pulls out an open, cracker box] Feast yourself on these slightly expired soda crackies [dumps the cube of stale crackers from the box and on the table. The cube shatters the bowl] as I explain ya the yarn that puts hair on your chest.
Squidward: I don't want any hair on my chest.
SpongeBob: Ooh, I do! [SpongeBob takes the cube of stale crackers, shoves it in his mouth and eats it.]
Mr. Krabs: It was a day just like this one. The wind was howling! [As Mr. Krabs begins his story, the scene changes to a ship sailing through a storm at sea.] And me ship was being tossed about,  like a rag doll on a trampoline! [The scene changes to the moment where Mr. Krabs, who had hair at that time, was a chef.] I was in the galley! Cooking up grub for me crew to keep their mind off this horrible squall! [Mr. Krabs chops some vegetables and made a salad. Then he peels a potato and adds it to the soup on the stove. He then takes a petal from a flower and adds it to the soup. Then he added some spices which formed in the shape of a heart and flies in the soup.] It was just then that he bursts into the galley!
SpongeBob: Who he?
Mr. Krabs: The man whose mission was to make my life a living nightmare! [As Mr. Krabs explains, SpongeBob takes the cracker box and eats some more stale crackers. He then eats the box next.] The roughest, toughest, scaliest old barnacle that ever roamed the briny deep! He was me commandin' officer and he loathe me with the white, hot hatred of a psychotic madman! [changes back to the ship] They called him, [A starfish that resembles Patrick Star bursts through the galley door in a captain outfit with a scar on the right side of his face] Captain Scarfish!
Captain Scarfish: Hello!
SpongeBob: Ahh! [cuts back to Mr. Krabs putting frosting on the cake. Scarfish's entrance scares him and accidentally melts the cake with the frosting.]
Captain Scarfish: Stand at attention, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs walks up and salutes the captain in fear.] I want you to tell me the meaning of this! [Scarfish shows him a sandwich on a plate.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that sir? Why sir, that's a sea-cucumber sandwich, sir, with the crusts cut off, sir. A little booshie-amusie for the boys, sir. [Scarfish throws the sandwich away.]
Captain Scarfish: This is the navy, son! We don't cut the crusts off! We eat the crusts and throw the rest away! [Scarfish opens a trunk full of dangerous, moldy crusts and starts craving on it.]
Mr. Krabs: But that's... That's madness! [Mr. Krabs tabs on the captain's shoulder. The captain turns around as he is chewing on the moldy crusts. He swallows the crusts.]
Captain Scarfish: I'm telling you for the last time! You're gonna have to stop making your food so delicious!
Mr. Krabs: But I don't know how!
Captain Scarfish: Well, you better figure it out! I need my men [stretches his face] wide-eyed and hungry, Krabs! We've got a cargo-hold full of suntan lotion! And... [Squidward interrupts]
Squidward: Wait, you were transporting suntan lotion? [laughs] What SPF? [continues laughing]
Mr. Krabs: I don't see what's so amusing about that, Mr. Squidward. We were a cargo ship [cuts back to the ship sailing in pirate territory where a sailor is swabbing the deck] heading straight into pirate territory with a fresh supply of suntan lotion for shipwreck sailors whose skin was chafed. [Squidward yawns] Chafed, Mr. Squidward!
SpongeBob: Chafed! [cuts back to ship]
Captain Scarfish: Chafed!
Mr. Krabs: Aye, sir! I understand, sir! Chafed!
Captain Scarfish: So, tonight's meal is gonna be terrible! You understand, me?!
Mr. Krabs: Aye, sir!
Captain Scarfish: The worst you've ever made!
Mr. Krabs: Aye-aye, sir!
Captain Scarfish: [turns around and pulls his shirt up. As he talks, his back forms a shape of a steel bar on his back] The kind of slop that will put some steel in their spines!
Mr. Krabs: Aye-aye, sir!
Captain Scarfish: Either that or I'll throw you in the brig! [Scarfish walks away]
Mr. Krabs: Yes, sir. [cuts to the captain's crew sitting at the table waiting for their food. Mr. Krabs walks in the dining room with the slop.]
Crew: Huzzah!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't "huzzah" yet, boys.
Lou: What's on the menu tonight, eh?
Mr. Krabs: Slop. [The crew laughs]
Lou: Oh, slop, eh? Good one! Why don't you put some of that delicious slop right here on my... [Mr. Krabs dishes up some slop on Lou's plate] Oh. I bet it's one of those things that looks bad, but it tastes really... [Lou tastes the slop but swallows it in disgust.] Bad.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sorry boys. [Mr. Krabs dishes the slop to the other sailors. He groans while serving the food.] Captain's orders. [Unfortunately, the crew doesn't like the slop and looks at Mr. Krabs in anger. Mr. Krabs becomes fed up with the captain's cruel orders.] Oh, I can't stand it! [Turns around and suits up like a soldier going for battle.] I don't care what the captain says! [He hits the service cart and turns the slop into pizza dough. He flips the dough a couple times and chops it up with a spatula, which then turns into a more, delectable meal for the crew.]
Crew: [gasps] Huzzah! Huzzah for Mr. Krabs! Huzzah! [Suddenly, Captain Scarfish bursts in, ruining the moment.]
Captain Scarfish: What's all this "huzzahing" about?!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nothing sir! Uh, they just really enjoy eating slop! Don't you, boys? [The crew mushes the delectable meal into slop to hide it from the captain.]
Captain Scarfish: Attention! [The crew salutes in fear. Captain Scarfish examines the food.] Looks like slop alright. But what's this? [Shows a bowl full of ice cream with raspberry syrup and a cherry.]
Mr. Krabs: Cherries jubilee.
Crew: Cherries jubilee!
Captain Scarfish: Cherries jubilee?!
Mr. Krabs: Well, flaming cherries jubilee.
Captain Scarfish: Flaming?! What are you trying to pull, you lubber? This looks like regular cherries jubilee!
Mr. Krabs: Well, you see, sir, I was just gonna take this here match and... [Lights a match and blows the flame on the cherries jubilee. This sets it on fire and the captain is burned in the face. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs locked in a prison cell.] And so, I found meself in the brig with two guards watching me every move. [A strange shadow appears on the wall next to the cell.] The one was as brutal and ugly a bounder as you ever wish to see in your darkest nightmare! [The shadow gets smaller and reveals to be a guard that looks like Squidward who is playing his clarinet.]
Octopus Sailor: Grr, what are you looking at? [The Octopus Sailor skips away as he continues playing his clarinet. As he skips away, a guard that looks like SpongeBob named Ensign is sitting, playing with a toy boat.]
Mr. Krabs: But I thought I could dupe the other one sure than need a rise. [The SpongeBob guard puts the boat toy in his head and forms a race track with his tongue. The boat slides out and the Ensign giggles. The scene changes back to SpongeBob laughing.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs. That second guard sounds like a real goofball.
Mr. Krabs: I managed to worm some useful information out of him right away. You see, he was an aspiring cook and I talked him into seeking some things down into the brig for me. The tombs of me trade you might say. [The scene changes to the SpongeBob guard making something out of cotton candy.] I set him to work on a sponge-sugared cathedral that took up most of his attention. [Mr. Krabs takes some cotton candy and makes a key out of it.] He never suspected that I was using the scraps to fashion a candy-key. Where's your sourpuss friend tonight?
Ensign: Sick in bed like all the men. The captain's been feeding them nothing but moldy, old sandwich crusts. [Ensign makes cotton candy from the machine.] They've all got terrible bellyaches. But not me, though. I cook for myself.
Mr. Krabs: Wise lad. [Mr. Krabs finishes making the candy-key as Ensign eats some cotton candy. This gives him a major league sugar rush.] And so, after a few hours of bouncing off the walls, the sugar finally wore off. [Ensign stops bouncing around and quickly falls asleep.] And soon, he was napping like a baby. This was me chance to use me sweet key to freedom. [Mr. Krabs goes to unlock himself out of his cell, but thinks for a minute and looks at Captain Scarfish's picture.] But did I dare take it? I'd be in violation of the naval code. Then something happened that made me mind up for me. [A cannonball appears out of nowhere and hits the wall.] Pirates! We were under attack! [Mr. Krabs frees himself from his cell.] I had to act fast! [He picks up Ensign and shakes him.] Wake up, lad! Wake up! Man your battle stations! [Ensign falls back to sleep. Mr. Krabs runs to the sickbay to get help, but the Octopus Sailor and the entire crew were to sick and weak to do anything.] I was on me own. [Mr. Krabs takes a telescope and sees a pirate ship and an island with the shipwreck sailors on it.] I could see it all. A pirate ship! And on that island: a crew of five naval men! Our only hope, marooned on a beach by those same scurvy pirates! [He imagines them being flipped and sizzled in a frying pan.] And suffered from the effects of chafe! Sunburn! [Then a boat with pirates are shown rowing towards the cargo ship. On the boat, their captain looks a lot like Sandy Cheeks.] The pirates had already launched a boat and were preparing to board our vessel!
Pirate Captain: Row, you worthless dogs!
Captain Scarfish: [Captain Scarfish bursts through the door.] Stand down, Krabs! I'll have you on irons! [He holds up two irons with steam coming out from the bottoms.]
Mr. Krabs: Listen to me, Captain! This is gonna get real ugly real fast! We've got to get to the cannons!
Captain Scarfish: We're not outfitted for battle, Krabs! There's no ammunition! The cannons are ornamental at best! [He shows a fancy-looking gold cannon with a candlestick holder on it.] Ornamental at best!
Mr. Krabs: Then listen carefully! We'll have to go down to the cargo-hold and poke holes in the barrels of suntan lotion and scuttle the ship!
Captain Scarfish: What you're suggesting is mutiny! [Suddenly, someone flings something on the captain's hat, making one of his hat decorations fall off. It turns out to be Ensign.]
Ensign: Do as he says, captain!
Mr. Krabs: What are you using for ammo there, Ensign?
Ensign: Oh, I rolled up an old, moldy sandwich crust into a hard, little ball. [Ensign takes a moldy crust and forms a ball.]
Mr. Krabs: [This give Mr. Krabs an idea.] That's it! [Mr. Krabs pushes Scarfish.] Come with me, lad! [Ensign and Mr. Krabs takes some moldy, old sandwich crusts and makes them into cannonballs. Mr. Krabs stuffs the moldy crust cannonball in the ornamental cannon. Ensign fires the cannonball at the ship which easily destroys it.] Direct hit!
Mr. Krabs and Ensign: Huzzah! [But the pirate captain and her crew invades the ship.]
Pirate Captain: You'll pay for that! Get 'em boys! [The pirates begin to attack.]
Ensign: Uh, what do I do?
Mr. Krabs: Get down to the cargo-hold and check on the captain! [Mr. Krabs uses his telescope as a sword as SpongeBob goes for the captain.] Charge! Hup! Hey! Whoop! Whoa! Hi-yah! Woo! [He whacks the pirate on the head.] Close one! Ha-ha! [He continues to fight as the pirate captain sits and watches with a cup of root beer in her hand.]
Pirate Captain: Aww, he's kinda handsome for a crusty old cuss.
Captain Scarfish: [Scarfish weeps as Ensign finds him in the cargo-hold.] I can't do it. I'm weak.
Ensign: Snap out of it, man! [Ensign slaps Scarfish, but to his surprise, the scar was a fake. Scarfish gasps and Ensign finds his scar on his hand.] Eeww!
Captain Scarfish: My personality! [Scarfish continues crying.]
Ensign: Oh, uh, let me put that back. [He slaps Scarfish again and his scar is back on his face, much to Scarfish's happiness. Ensign takes a sword and climbs to the top of the barrel and pokes a big hole on it. Releasing a huge torrent of suntan lotion which sweeps away Scarfish. Ensign swings to the ship's haul and makes an opening for the torrent. The suntan lotion with Scarfish on it surfs towards the island with the five naval fish on it. The lotion successfully cured them from their sunburns.]
Naval Fish: Oh my! This feels wonderful! Yes, it feels great! [The naval fish gets up and swims to the cargo ship to rescue Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs continues fighting the pirates.] Hoo! Whoo! Ha-ha! Whoop! Missed me! [He fights until he loses his telescope.] Uh-oh! Uh, anyone for cherries jubilee?
Pirate Captain: Finish him off! [Just as Mr. Krabs was about to meet his end, the naval fish appears.]
Naval Fish: Huzzah for Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ha-ha! The sunburn brigade! [The naval fish traps the pirates in a net.] Ha-ha! Me plan worked! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!
Pirate Captain: Handsome and clever, I see. [She blinks at him for a few seconds, but instead of releasing her, Mr. Krabs puts her in the prison cell.] Join me, Krabs! We'll rule the seven seas together!
Mr. Krabs: I can't let you go, lass. That'll be violation of the naval code. Enjoy your last meal. I hope you like sponge-sugar! [Mr. Krabs winks at her as he gives her a pie. The pirate captain begins to eat the pie and finds something in it.]
Pirate Captain: Huh? [It turns out to be the candy-key he made earlier.] Oh! [She giggles as she and Mr. Krabs wink at Ensign, who made a cotton candy sculpture of the Statue of Liberty. Then it cuts back to the Krusty Krab with Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob winking at each other.]
Squidward: What are we all winking about?
SpongeBob: I don't know! [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs continues to wink, much to Squidward's annoyance.]


[The episode opens up with SpongeBob's, Patrick's, and Squidward's houses.]
[Squidward opens his door, sees that a flower does not stand up straight and then fixes it.]
[The scene pans to show that everything on his lawn is clean, except for a seashell on the left side of it.]
[The camera shows Squidward angry. He walks over to the seashell, looks around and kicks it onto SpongeBob's lawn while whistling casually.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's house. The window opens, and SpongeBob's face is shown. He exits through his window and sits on its rim. He notices the seashell on his lawn, he gets an idea and starts sliding to the back of his house to his garage to get a reef blower. The giant backpack-like container, with a blower hose, which looks like a jet engine, a power switch, and a pull starter.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward resting on his hammock.]
[Squidward hears the reef blower's motor throbbing. He sees SpongeBob exiting out of his garage with the reef blower. Squidward grumbles and puts in his ear plugs so that he can continue to rest.]
[SpongeBob gets to the seashell and tries to blow it away from his lawn by using the reef blower. He does this twice. He then blows extra hard, and a huge amount of sand is thrown in the air.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward eating some vegetables when the huge amount of sand falls from the sky and buries him. SpongeBob runs towards Squidward and blows the sand away.]
[Squidward looks at a leaf on his plate with grains of sand on it.]
[SpongeBob cleans the leaf in front of Squidward's head, tearing apart half of the leaf and causing grains of sand to get into Squidward's eyes. SpongeBob cleans Squidward's eyes with another blow.]
[The scene changes to show a large pile of sand on SpongeBob's lawn.]
[SpongeBob points his finger to it and mouths a word and the caption says "You!". He walks to the pile of sand, sets the reef blower to reverse and uses it suck up the sand from his lawn.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's lawn clean, but then reef blower starts breaking apart, throwing out sand and parts of the machinery.]
[SpongeBob takes off the reef blower. He unzips the pack. He goes over to pick up the thrown out contents. The reef blower coughs while he is absent. He returns with large hands carrying the thrown out contents. He zips it back up and pulls the pull starter in an attempt to try to start it. The motor starts and then dies.]
[The camera shows him becoming angry or just determined. The scene changes and he pulls the handle very far.]
[SpongeBob lets go of the handle, which stays still. SpongeBob wipes his hands together. He grabs the handle again. The handle pulls him away, leaving a bubble silhouette of SpongeBob that quickly dissolves. SpongeBob passes an intersection where two fish in two different cars going opposite directions stop. He passes some houses and finally returns to the reef blower, where he gets strapped in.]
[The reef blower starts, sucking up all the water in the sea, causing Squidward, who is sitting on his front doorstep, to gasp due to the inability to breathe air. His eyes also change into X's.]
[The scene changes to show the reef blower massive, and then it explodes, causing water to cover the screen. When the water stops, the screen shows big piles of sand everywhere, but SpongeBob's lawn is relatively clean.]
[SpongeBob exits one of the piles, wipes his hands together, and happily enters his house.]
[Episode ends with Squidward at his doorstep, with a pile of sand covering him except for his head. The seashell falls on Squidward's nose. Squidward narrows his eyelids.]


[the episode opens with Squidward lying in bed, asleep and he wakes up to a loud noise]
Squidward: What the...? [we see SpongeBob outside grinding his spatula on a rotating wheel and Squidward opens window] SpongeBob, do you mind!?
[Squidward breaks the window off its hinges and throws it at SpongeBob. The window hits the rotating wheel instead and it bounces off and hits Squidward in the face. From the impact, he loses his balance and falls out the window, he then bounces on his head and then bounces off of SpongeBob's pineapple, his tentacles land over SpongeBob's eyes, causing SpongeBob to finally notice Squidward]
SpongeBob: Oh! Hey, Squidward. What are you doing?
Squidward: [gets back up] What am I doing!? What are you doing!?
SpongeBob: I am sharpening my trusty spatula. Speaking of which, are you going to stick around for morning fry-cook calisthenics?
Squidward: Cala-what?
[SpongeBob then proceeds in a series of rather ridiculous stretches as Squidward walks back to his house to lock the door, Squidward then starts walking to work]
SpongeBob: Walking to work, huh, Squidward?
Squidward: Go away.
SpongeBob: Can I walk with you?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Please?
Squidward: No. [the last two lines are repeated several times as they both walk, Squidward finally gets fed up with SpongeBob's repetitious begging as they enter the Krusty Krab] I said NO! I will not walk to work with yo--! [notices he is in the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Okay. Maybe tomorrow, then!
[fade out, the next scene shows Squidward at the register with a customer]
Customer: I'll have two Krabby Patties.
Squidward: Okay. And would you like cheese on-- [he stops at a noise that sounds like someone extruding gas]
Customer: Do you...need a break or something?
Squidward: [nervously] What? Oh, no! Wha--? No-ho, that was not me, I swear. [sound repeats, the customer walks away with Squidward stuttering and begging nervously, Squidward walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is unsuccessfully attempting to squeeze mustard onto a Krabby Patty] SpongeBob! [he snatches the mustard bottle from SpongeBob and opens the mustard bottle] It's empty! [he then shoves the mustard bottle into SpongeBob's eye] See empty!
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, how do you know that? [Squidward takes the mustard bottle out of SpongeBob's eye]
Squidward: Well, let's see, maybe 'cause I have a brain. [as he said this, he leans on the grill]
SpongeBob: Oh-uh, Squidward, the grill is on.
Squidward: Oh, really? And do you think that I don't know that this grill is... [he sees his hand burning on the grill and then screams, he runs around SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I gotta do something. [he removes the mop and then takes the bucket of water, Squidward runs to the right] Okay, Squidward, this should help. [SpongeBob turns the bucket sideways and is ready pour it on Squidward but accidentally spills the water, Squidward slips on the puddle of water and is flying in mid-air] Don't worry, Squidward, I'll catch you. [he got out his jellyfishing net and holds it up to catch Squidward, but Squidward goes in the net and hit's the wall snapping the net in the process, Squidward then falls in a deep fryer and is being fried, SpongeBob screams and goes over to deep fryer and picks up the net with Squidward in it, now Squidward looks like an ice cream cone when he's fried and we see a close up of the fried Squidward] I can fix this. [he runs but he accidentally trips on the mop that was on the floor, he hit's a tin cupboard and bounces off and slams into the counter, Squidward is sent flying and into a customer's Krabby Patty taking it's place, the customer takes a bite out of Squidward causing him and the customer to scream, Squidward jumps away and flies into the other direction, SpongeBob runs to intercept him] This time, I got ya. [Squidward hits SpongeBob's face and bounces off and finally crashing into a soda dispenser, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs gasps, Squidward lies there muttering as the soda sprays on him, Mr. Krabs rushes near the mess]
Mr. Krabs: Me soda machine! [cries]
SpongeBob: Squidward, can you hear me? How many fingers am I... [Squidward smacks SpongeBob away and screams, then leaps behind table, destroying it] Squidward? [Squidward screams and whacks two customers away, he climbs up wall and looks down at floor]
Mr. Krabs: You really sent him over the edge this time.
SpongeBob: Technically, I drove him up the wall.
Narrator: One shift later...
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, I got a present for you.
SpongeBob: [gives a big smile with twinkling eyes] Present? A present? For me?
Squidward: Now, now. Calm down. I've should've given this to you a long time ago!
[Squidward knocks SpongeBob down and gives him the piece of paper]
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward! My very own...[Looks at the restraining order] restraining order. Uh...what is that?
Squidward: Perhaps my lawyers should explain. [points over to his lawyers Harry, Combover, and Bald]
Harry: We are the law offices of Harry, Combover, and Bald! Specializing in restraining order logical law and here to tell one Mr. SquarePants...
Harry, Combover, &amp; Bald: You've been served!
SpongeBob: Served? I don't understand. Squidward, what is these guys- [Before he can reach Squidward, he is stopped by Harry and Combover and Bald pushes Squidward further from him]
Bald: Per paragraph 3 of the restraining order, you may no longer speak to our client. [Draws a dot circle on the ground with chalk] Likewise, you may not come within 15 feet of Mr. Squidward at any time. Any infractions of these statues will result in serious jail time!
SpongeBob: Can you make Krabby Patties for loyal Krusty Krab patrons during "serious jail time"?
Bald: Huh? [Squidward whispers in his ear]
Squidward: And. [Back to whispering]
Bald: No.
SpongeBob: [screams] No! I don't wanna go!
Combover: Well, then, follow the guidelines we've explain and you won't have to.
SpongeBob: Uh, sirs? If I can't speak to, or get within fifteen feet of Squidward, how are we going to get anything done around here?
Harry, Combover, and Bald: That's not our problem. [They all fly off]
SpongeBob: [Walks in front of the dotted line] Hmm...[Next scene to him cooking Krabby Patties and puts them on a long hand-made spatula made of wood and mops] There we go! Three Krabby Patties, two large Kelpy Colas, and three fries ready to be served. [Tries to give Squidward the order but he puts up a glass window] Hmm? [Carries the order on the hand-made spatula with stings and another piece of wood on the other side of Squidward also in front of the door. Mr. Krabs comes out, walks right into it and it knocks him on the ground] Oops! [Run over to Mr. Krabs] Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs! It's just so hard to get this food to Squidward without violating this restraining order. [Shows him the restraining order]
Mr. Krabs: Let me see that! [Takes the restraining order and wipes the mustard off him, then gives it back to SpongeBob] Thank you! Look, boy, I don't know what in coral cabins what a restraining order is, but I do know whatever's going on here clearly ain't working. Now I want this ship sailing smoothly! On the double! Or I'll be forced to remove more gold stars from your employee performance chart! [Takes away a star from SpongeBob's Employee Chart]
SpongeBob: [screams] Think, SpongeBob, think! Gasp! I got it!
[Cuts to Patrick in the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: [Giggling and moves closer and closer to Squidward] Hehe.
Squidward: [Reading a book] Oh, if I ignore it, maybe it will go away.
Patrick: [Still giggling] Hehe.
Squidward: I thought not [Closes the book] Oh-kay Patrick. What? What? What!
Patrick: [Still giggling] Notice anything... [Smacks Squidward's noise with the Krusty Krab hat he is wearing] Different? Huh? Huh? A hint! [Takes out a drawing held upside-down of the Krusty Krab hat pointing to it and his hat]
Mr. Krabs: Patrick! I am not not paying you to stand around and play guess what the idiot's thinking with Squidward! Get back to work!
Squidward: Yeah, Patrick! Get back to...what? Work? Oh no! No! No! No! Krabs! [Walks past SpongeBob who moves backwards then forwards] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Why all the shivering of the timbers, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! This will not stand!
Mr. Krabs: It'll stand. Oh, unless you'd rather talk with SpongeBob.
[Squidward grunts angrily then bubble transition to a customer buying a Krabby Patty. Squidward hands Patrick the ticket and Patrick takes it to SpongeBob who then makes the Krabby Patties then hands it to Patrick. Patrick gives the order to Squidward who then gives it to the customer]
Squidward: What?
Patrick: Can I watch you work?
Squidward: No.
Patrick: Please? [This line is repeated several more times, as Squidward gets fed up with Patrick asking].
Squidward: No!
Patrick: Pretty please?
Squidward: No! No! No! No! [growls] [Patrick continues to follow him] Go away Patrick! Go away Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! [Washes hands and Patrick appears in the mirror] Patrick! [Patrick touches his hat]  Patrick! [Pushes button on cash register and Patrick appears] Patrick! [Starts walking with Patrick closely following him behind] Patrick! [Using the restroom with Patrick beside him] Patrick! [Starts sweating and shivering with Mr. Krabs now beside him]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward...
Squidward: [screams]
Mr. Krabs: Time for your break. [Walks off]
Squidward: Ah...don't mind if I do. [Sits down] Ah...no better way to spend a break then with a little cool jazz. [Takes out the box that holds his clarinet and tries to play it but it isn't there] Huh?
Patrick: [Comes out of the restroom] Hi Squidward!
Squidward: Hello...you...
Patrick: I just finished cleaning the restroom!
Squidward: [Sarcastically] Ooh...that's great...
Patrick: I mopped the floors! I shined the mirrors! I scrubbed the sinks.
Squidward: [Sarcastically] Wonderful.
Patrick: Oh yeah! [Takes out Squidward's clarinet that is soaking wet] But we are going to need a new toilet plunger. This one's broken.
Squidward: Patrick! [Takes back the clarinet and growls at Patrick which Mr. Krabs appears to see what is happening]
Mr. Krabs: Nice work, Patrick! Break time's over, Mr. Squidward.
Squidward:  [Walks over to a customer] Welcome to the House of Misery. May I take your order...
Dave: Yes, I would like two Double Fried Kelp Fritters, three Krusty Krab Cream Filled Corals, and four Triple Fatty Krabby Patties. Is that too much?
Squidward: That depends...
Dave: On what?
Squidward: How long you want to live? [Laughs and walks right into Patrick]
Patrick: [Laughs as Squidward's nose is stuck in is mouth. Squidward tries hard to get his nose free and he does but goes flying in the process] Hah hah! Squidward's funny! [Looks down and picks up something] Hey, a button!
Gus: [Comes in holding a pie] Oh, Grammy, I brought your favorite; seaberry pie. [Notices Squidward flying toward him] Yikes! [Runs away]
Squidward: [Crashes into the seaberry pie and then onto the window. Then tastes the pie] Seaberries? I'm allergic to...[Body and face puff up] Seaberries...That's it! I know what I must do! [Starts walking toward SpongeBob] SpongeBob!
Patrick: You're the prettiest button I've ev... [Spots Squidward] Huh? Monster!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
Patrick: It's after SpongeBob! [Pause and looks at the button] You're right, button! No monster is going to eat our friend! [Jumps up high and yells; heads toward Squidward]  
Squidward: No, no no no wait!
[Patrick lands on Squidward and starts attacking him. They both head into the back where SpongeBob is then they start fighting]
SpongeBob: Oh no! My two best friends are fighting! [Takes out restraining order] But this restraining order says I can't get close enough to break it off! [Watches as Squidward squirts mustard at Patrick's face and Patrick then hits him with a spatula. They both continue to roll around and fight] I'm sorry, restraining order! But my friends need me! [Screams and dives toward Squidward and Patrick and breaks up the fighting] Stop!
Squidward: [Notices the restraining order in SpongeBob's pocket and takes it] Give me that restraining order!
SpongeBob: [screams]
Squidward: Alright, right, let's look at this.
SpongeBob: Squidward, please don't send me to jail!
Patrick: [Confused] Squidward? [Looks at his button] Did you know the monster was Squidward? Well, when were you going to tell me?
SpongeBob: [Starts crying] I violated the restraining order! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Squidward: Quit bellyaching and hand me a pen.
SpongeBob: [Cries] Here you go. [Hands him a pen then continues crying]
Squidward: Stop the waterworks! You're not going to jail.
SpongeBob: I'm not? [stops crying]
Squidward: No! I'm releasing you from this order. [Crosses out SpongeBob's name on the restraining order]
SpongeBob: Really, Squidward?
Squidward: ...And adding someone who is much more deserving!
Patrick: Sorry, button.
Squidward: No, Patrick! You! [Shows the restraining order with "Patrick Star" now written on it]
Patrick: Oh! Ah hah hah hah hah!
[The episode ends with Patrick still laughing hysterically]


[Pan across Goo Lagoon]
Narrator: Ah, Goo. Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me, but to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful, stinky mud puddle. [SpongeBob and Sandy sit enjoying the beach. SpongeBob sighs]
SpongeBob: What a great day. [he runs off] Hey, Sandy... look! [he is now covered in a mound of sand] I'm Sandy!!
Sandy: Hahahahaha!
SpongeBob: [Sandy laughs. SpongeBob forms sand around his head and nose to look like Squidward and imitates his voice] Hey Sandy, who am I? [Sandy still laughs. SpongeBob picks up a sand phone] Hello, SpongeBob? Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. [Sandy continues laughing]
Sandy: SpongeBob! [a doorbell rings, SpongeBob walks in carrying sand pizza boxes and wearing a Krusty Krab sand hat]
SpongeBob: Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? [SpongeBob and Sandy laugh together. Larry walks up]
Larry the Lobster: Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.
Sandy: Hey, Larry.
Larry: You guys wanna go lift some weights?
Sandy: Sure. [she and Larry walk off] Well, come on, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob's sand pizzas and hat fall flat as he walks on dejectedly]
SpongeBob: [disappointingly] Coming. [Cut to a group of weightlifters, each grunting as they work out. Larry turns to Sandy]
Larry: Give it a try, Sandy. [Sandy stands in front of a weight. She picks it up, grunting as she does so. The crowd cheers for her, and she throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? [SpongeBob tries to walk off]
Larry: How about a little more weight? [Larry bends down to pick up a weight heavier than Sandy's] Observe. [Larry grunts as he picks it up, his eyes bulging, and veins stick out from his neck. The crowd cheers, and Larry throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: All right! Stand back, everyone! [SpongeBob picks up a single twig from the ground. The crowd is silent. He sinks into the sand. Sandy walks to a weight]
Sandy: Y'all watch this! [Sandy picks up an anchor weight. The crowd cheers for her, but stop when they realize Larry has lifted the spectator stands] Way to go, Larry! [SpongeBob burrows into the sand, and tunnels over to a fish picnicking next to a marshmallow sack]
SpongeBob: Could I borrow a couple of these?
Darwin: [through his marshmallow-filled mouth] Mm-hmm. [crams another marshmallow into his mouth.]
SpongeBob: [takes two marshmallows and places them on the twig] And now, with the addition of two, COUNT 'EM, two marshmallows! [SpongeBob preps himself for his lift, inhales deeply, takes hold of the twig, and is unable to lift it. The crowd isn't moved. He tries again. And again. After a huge effort, SpongeBob hears a rip. He looks down and notices that he's ripped his pants. The crowd gasps, then laughs at SpongeBob. SpongeBob scuttles off, embarrassed. Scooter walks over, laughing]
Scooter: That was too funny. [he slaps SpongeBob on the back] You are hilarious!
Sandy: Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw? [SpongeBob grins widely. Cut to Larry]
Larry: Anybody up for some volleyball? [the ball volleys back and forth, until Larry spikes it into some fish and the crowd cheers for him. SpongeBob looks at him in contempt. A fish serves the ball and as Larry is about to hit it, SpongeBob interferes]
SpongeBob: I got it! [the ball falls and SpongeBob tries to serve it] Incoming! [the serve misses and the crowd boos. He bends down to pick the ball up and rips his pants] Oops... I guess I ripped my pants again! [the crowd laughs. Scooter walks in laughing again]
Scooter: Once again, dude, [he slaps SpongeBob on the back] YOU have split my sides! [he continues to laugh. Cut to a Frisbee. Larry catches it and throws it to Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?
Sandy: Okay, here it comes! [SpongeBob stands still and lets the Frisbee hit him on the head, knocking him over]
SpongeBob: I could use a hand here! [he laughs. Sandy walks over and helps him up]
Sandy: You okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess so... [he does a handstand, revealing his pants] ...except I ripped my pants! [the crowd laughs, and Scooter walks up to SpongeBob once again]
Scooter: You still got it, dude! [he slaps SpongeBob on the back again. Cut to SpongeBob and Sandy walking to an ice cream vendor]
Lou Vendor: May I help you?
SpongeBob: I'll take a banana split.
Lou: Uh, we don't have that.
SpongeBob: That's okay, I already "split" my pants! Get it??? [Sandy giggles]
Lou: [annoyed] Tee-hee. Anything else?
SpongeBob: How about, ripple? [he does so, Sandy giggles again] No, thanks, already got one. [Sandy drops laughing, Lou is unamused, and SpongeBob happily bounces off to a snack bar. SpongeBob runs up to Harold, knocking his drink over] Is that a burger you're eating?
Harold: Why, yes, it is.
SpongeBob: You know what would go good with that?
Harold: No, what?
SpongeBob: [whispers] Ripped... pants... [SpongeBob smiles widely and shows the annoyed Harold his ripped pants. SpongeBob then runs around the snack bar, laughing. He comes up in-between two fish] Ripped pants a la mode! [he rips his pants, the fish are annoyed. Cut to SpongeBob being in the kitchen of the snack bar, next to the fry cook] Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? [SpongeBob shoves his behind through the box, revealing his ripped pants. He laughs and the box is revealed to have no lower part. The fry cook groans disgustedly. Cut to a broadcasting booth over looking the lagoon]
Perch Perkins: Surf's up in the Goo Lagoon. [fish are surfing. Close-up of Perch Perkins] And here comes Larry, doing his trademark lay-back. [cut to Larry lying on his surfboard] There goes Sandy, hanging ten... fingers, that is. [cut to Sandy doing a handstand on her surfboard] There goes SpongeBob... [rip] ripping his pants again. [Perch Perkins is annoyed, then cut to SpongeBob ripping his pants on his surfboard. A wave knocks SpongeBob off his surfboard and washes him up on the beach]
Lifeguard: Hey, look! A cardboard box washed up on the beach! [he takes a closer look through his telescope] HOLY FISH PASTE! IT'S A GUY!!! [he sprints over to SpongeBob and flips him over] WHY?! WWWUUHHHYYY-HY-HY-HY?!! WWWUUHHHHAAAAAA-HY-HYY-HYYY-HYYYYGH?????!!!!! [a crowd gathers around SpongeBob and the lifeguard]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [to lifeguard] Come closer... [a divine light shines on him] I need... I need...
Lifeguard: What do you need?! [tears come to the lifeguard's and Sandy's eyes]
SpongeBob: [pats the lifeguard on the shoulder. Close up of SpongeBob's mouth] A tailor. [the light turns off, accompanied by a light switch] Because I ripped my pants!! [he laughs. The lifeguard makes an annoyed expression, drops SpongeBob, and the crowd surrounding him walks off with annoyance. SpongeBob is left alone and Sandy walks up to him angry]
Sandy: That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick! [she walks off. Scooter walks towards SpongeBob and looks at him sadly]
Scooter: [he shakes his head] Dude... [he walks off. Cut to a dressing tent, with SpongeBob inside]
SpongeBob: [thinking] Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think. Your public's waiting. [speaking] Let's see... [checking them off a list] "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown," [he uses his pencil to write the word "NO" and circle it] Noooooooo. Come on, think. I got it! Hey, everybody! [he runs out of the dressing tent] Not ripped pants! [he tears his pants off] Pants ripped off! Huh? Someone call the police, there's a pants thief on the loose! [the wind howls, SpongeBob standing alone on the beach. A tumbleweed rolls by. SpongeBob turns and hears party music at a distance, and sees Larry and Sandy playing volleyball] Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. [lies on the beach as he continues saying, no] We blew it, pants. [throws his pants aside]
Pants: What do you mean, "we?" [the pants walk off, leaving SpongeBob alone]
SpongeBob: Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! [Millie walks up to SpongeBob, shining red]
Jennifer: No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen. [she places a fin on herself, and it leaves a sounding mark, which vanishes]
SpongeBob: Ouch. [a fish walks up to the two]
Dexter: No, I am. I got sand in my buns. [he shows them two sandy hamburger buns. There is a rumbling coming from the sand and a whale pops his head out of the sand]
Frank: No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.
All: What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I lost my best friend.
All: How? [SpongeBob grabs a sand guitar and sings]
SpongeBob: When I ripped... [his underwear starts ripping] my pants. [he starts to sing] I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I [rips his underwear again] ripped my pants. [the other three "losers of the beach" assemble on a sand stage with sand instruments and sing]
All: ♪When big Larry came round just to put him down, SpongeBob turned into a clown, and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and [Jennifer turns around and suddenly, her bottom then rips, splitting open, revealing her white underwear] ripped his pants!♪
SpongeBob: [singing voice, a crowd begins to gather] ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪
All: ♪Or sand in your buns!♪ [instrumental break. The sandy bun fish scrapes the two buns together to make a rhythm then the curtain shows waves crashing about]
SpongeBob: ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ [the whole group comes together one by one in sync with the music and they rip their pants. By now, a huge crowd has gathered and is cheering the group onstage. A blimp flies by with SpongeBob's name on it. It's revealed that SpongeBob and his band were having a concert.]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sandy! [she gets onstage and hugs SpongeBob. He returns the embrace]
Sandy: Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself. [Larry walks up]
Larry: [impressed with SpongeBob's singing during the big concert] SpongeBob, that was so righteous. [hands SpongeBob a pencil]  Would you... sign my pants??
SpongeBob: Absolutely, buddy. [SpongeBob bends down to sign Larry's pants. His underwear then rips off completely, leaving SpongeBob "au naturel." Someone off-screen whistles. SpongeBob covers his crotch, grins, and blushes sheepishly]


[The big foghorn alarm wakes up SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Good...morning, Gary!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Say, Gary, do you ever wonder what Patrick's mornings are like?
Patrick: [cuts to Patrick sleeping on his recliner. The alarm goes off and he panics] Huh? What? Huh? No! [screaming] What's making that noise? Hu-huh? [squints his eyes to see the alarm] Oh. [laughs with relief] It's you again. [alarm keeps ringing] Okay, joke's over. [still ringing] Alright, you got me. Now cut it out. [still ringing] That's it! [grunts with exertion at the lamp] Stop your ringing, mister! I'm warning you. Stop it! I said quit it! [breaks the lamp in half but he can still hear the ringing] Where's it coming from? Make it stop. [alarm rings its way over to Patrick] You've got to help me find out where that ringing is coming from. [alarm rings its way back over to the other side of the room] Hey, come back! Oh, fine. I'll ask someone who cares. [takes off his underwear,and therefore, is naked, then puts it on a pillow, and draws SpongeBob's face on it] SpongeBob, where's that ringing coming from? [pillow falls over on the alarm to where you can hear a rumble. Patrick's stomach grumbles] Breakfast! [cut to Patrick in front of the pantry] Come to Patrick! [opens up the cabinet and all the cans fall out] Tartar sauce. I'm out of food again. All I have is these lousy cans with pictures of food on them. I wanted real food not pictures! [sloshing the can] Oh. The food is in the can. Okay, come on out. Come on. Oh, yeah. [gets a plate and puts it on the counter] Okay, breakfast, get on the plate. Come on. Nice, comfy plate just for you. Come on, get on there. Hello? Anybody in there? [dial tone] No answer. I'm coming to rescue you. [bangs head on the can a few times] Having a little trouble reaching you. [cuckooing] You stupid cans. [throws the can away, but the can hits the alarm, making it stop, and breaks in half] Oh. Food. Ah, my favorite time of the day. Breakfast and a little morning television. [turns on TV]
Announcer: And now, live from Bikini Bottom, it's "Bikini Bottom Live". [Patrick eats all his food in one spoonful. Then sticks out his tongue to reveal the alarm clock still ringing]
Patrick: Oh my gosh. [sticks his tongue back in his mouth and swallows the clock] I'm late, I'm late, I'm late! [Starts running] I gotta put on my pants and brush my teeth! [trips over the broken lamp, tripping down the stairs and over Gary] Gary? [flies through his drawers, coming out the other side with his pants on] Pants [pants then fly through the bathroom, coming out with a toothbrush] A clean mouth is a happy mouth. [the toothpaste flies off the toothbrush] Done. [Patrick bounces off the side, onto the roof, the bathtub, and out of his rock where SpongeBob is waiting]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, how was your morning?
Patrick: Oh, you know, usual.


[At Glove World! Where SpongeBob and Patrick are standing outside the amusement park.]
SpongeBob: [Patrick is licking a glove-shaped lollipop] Another funtastic day at Glove World! [bus stops at the bus stop and both of them get in, but SpongeBob struggles for a bit with his balloon]
Bus Driver: Ahem. [points to coin deposit]
SpongeBob: Let me get my wallet. [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver's face] Wait, let me check this pocket. [turns around and the balloon hits him again] No... [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver again] Patrick? Do you have any change?
Patrick: How much do you need?
SpongeBob: How much is it?
Bus Driver: Fifty cents.
SpongeBob: [turns around and the balloon smacks the bus driver in the back of his head] Fifty cents.
Patrick: Nope.
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] Lemme check my other poc-
Bus Driver: Forget it!
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] What did you say?
Bus Driver: Just take your seat!
SpongeBob: Thanks, mister.
Bus Driver: Yeah, whatev- [SpongeBob turns around and balloon smacks him in the back of the head.]
Patrick: Show me what you got at Glove World!
SpongeBob: Okay! Here's my glove light. [turns on light]
Patrick: Wow...
SpongeBob: [puts light inside his head] I see you! [both laugh]
Patrick: I got gloves for my glove action-figure! [puts a tiny glove on the big glove's thumb]
SpongeBob: Cool! [Patrick looks out the window and notices a sign that says "You Are Now Leaving Bikini Bottom" as they drive past it]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [a tiny glove is on his nose] Yeah, Patrick?
Patrick: Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?
SpongeBob: Where did you see that?
Patrick: We just passed the sign. 'You are now in Leaving Bikini Bottom'.
SpongeBob: [gasps] What?! [looks out the window]
Patrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob? [driving past a sign that says "Bikini Bottom City Limits"]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think we're on the wrong... [Screams as bus drives down at a 90-degree angle road. SpongeBob and Patrick fly back and his the back of the bus] ...bus! [SpongeBob walks slowly up front. His face gets all distorted as he is moving closer. His pants rip off and fly at Patrick, but Patrick ducks in time. Then SpongeBob's underwear hits Patrick in the face. Bus comes to an immediate stop and both fly forward and hit the windshield. Then the balloon smacks the bus driver onto the windshield and all of them peel off. SpongeBob and Patrick are kicked off the bus] But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom.
Bus Driver: [hands balloon to SpongeBob] Oh, well. [drives bus away]
Patrick: What is this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [reads sign] Rock Bottom. [scroll over to a bus station] It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different. [picks up some green soil]
Green Soil: Do you... [raspberry] mind... [raspberry] putting me down? [SpongeBob shakes him off as he gasps]
Patrick: Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart! [bathroom doors have the "?" on one door and the "¿" on the other]
SpongeBob: Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know. [someone comes out the "¿" door. Patrick gasps] Maybe we should wait for one more. [a snake-like creature comes out of the "?" door. 3 creatures come out the "¿" door]
Patrick: I still can't read the sign! I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes. I'm gonna get a bus schedule. [walks off] Boy, this place sure is creepy. [bus drives by with Patrick's head sticking out the window]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here! [SpongeBob runs after the bus] SpongeBob...! [bus drives up the 90-degree angle road and SpongeBob tries to run up the road but falls down. Tries a couple more times but is unsuccessful]
SpongeBob: I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus. [puts on Grandpa disguise] Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle. [takes off disguise] I better go wait for the next one. [later, SpongeBob is standing by the bus stop sign with his glove balloon in his right hand] C'mon, bus! I've got to get home and feed Gary! [notices shoe untied and lets go of the balloon] Uh-oh, shoe's untied. [Puts foot on bus sign] Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over... [bus drives up and then drives off] and through the barrel. [later, wind is blowing SpongeBob's glove hat on his side so he puts it back. Wind blows balloon away] My balloon! [chases after balloon jumping for it when he gets the chance. A bus drives up and then drives off] Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus! Aww, not again! [throws hat down. Notices a creature with a red light on his head for an antenna] Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me? [the creature gives raspberry] Uhh, uhh, yeah, I... [creature runs after balloon] No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know when the next bus comes... [bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob runs after it, but decides to walk back to the bus stop sign] Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot no matter what! [SpongeBob's stomach growls] I'm gettin' hungry. Glove candy dispenser! Good thing I went to Glove World!. [squeezes out 6 tiny glove candies onto his tongue, then spits them out] Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that? [a Kandy Machine is shown across the road] A candy machine. [Rubs his tummy] Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. Mmm... [Checks each side of the road to see if a bus is coming] I'm not leaving this spot no matter what! [stomach growls] I'll only be gone a second. [runs over to the machine. While getting out a quarter, a bus drives up. Runs back across to bus] Hey! [bus drives off] Ooh! [stomach growls. Takes a few steps across the road and turns around to check for the bus. Takes a few more steps and checks again. Gets to the candy machine and takes out the quarter. Before inserting it, he checks for a bus. There's no bus so he puts in the quarter but a bus DOES come and drives off. Now he checks to his left down the road and decides to sprint across and get some candy. Pushes some buttons and checks for the bus. The candy is slowly coming down] Come on, come on! [candy drops to the bottom. SpongeBob grabs for it, but a bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob gets angry. He reaches for the candy but a bus comes up. Every time he reaches for the candy, the bus drives forward but when he pulls his arm away, the bus drives backwards. So he decides to leave the candy and run after the bus, but the bus drives off before he can get there. A creature comes up and takes the candy] Hey! That was mine! [walks over to the candy machine. 3 buses drives up and drive off while he's over there so he decides to run back. No more buses come, so he shakes the bus sign angrily] Barnacles! Alright, that's it! No more mister nice guy! [later, SpongeBob is at the candy machine staring at it and a bus drives up. Another SpongeBob tip-toes up, but the SpongeBob at the candy machine falls over revealing it to be made of wood. The bus drives off] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob is now a bench. A bus drives up, but drives off after it notices the SpongeBob bench] Fish paste! [walking into the bus station] I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom! I am first in line and no one is gonna tell me otherwise! [sees a giant green round creature standing behind him already in line] Okay, second! I am second in line! [sees another giant creature already in line] Okay, third is good! [another creature is already in line] Fourth, not bad. [Cut to SpongeBob at the end of the line behind a yellow creature] Okay, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it! [yellow creature spits out a giant egg on SpongeBob's head with the number 329 on it]
Window Attendant: Next. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Well, at least the line is moving. [everyone steps forward. Egg hatches 3 baby yellow creatures that jump in front of SpongeBob, thus making him now 331st in line. SpongeBob gets extremely angry. He lets out an angry growl.] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob hides inside his clothes and goes ballistic. Then comes out and everyone staring at him turns around]
Window Attendant: [time is going fast. raspberry] Next. [raspberry] Next. [raspberry. SpongeBob is sleeping] Next. [raspberry] Next.
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh?
Window Attendant: Next. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Finally! Yes, I'm next! [runs up to the window] When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?
Window Attendant: What? [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The bus schedule. The next bus.
Window Attendant: I can't... [raspberry] understand... [raspberry] your accent. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The next bus... [raspberry] to Bikini... [raspberry] Bottom. [long raspberry]
Window Attendant: Ohh. [raspberry] Why didn't you say so? [raspberry] Next bus leaves in... [raspberry] 5 seconds. [bus leaves] Ohh, tough luck, kid. [raspberry] That's the last one til' morning. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Oh, [raspberry] no... [raspberry] you don't! [raspberry]
Window Attendant: Goodnight! [puts closed sign up]
SpongeBob: Hold it, I'm not through here! [raspberry] Do you hear me? [raspberry] I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom right now! Until then, I am not leaving this spot! [gives 3 raspberries. Lights turn off. SpongeBob laughs nervously] Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light! [turns on light] Ah, that's better.
[The glove light stops working; short pause.]
SpongeBob: This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... advanced darkness. Hey! [closes eyes] If I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark.
[A raspberry is heard in the distance; he opens his eyes]
SpongeBob: Who's there?! [walks down the road] Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking. [hears another raspberry] Running! Better start running! Running! [hears another raspberry] Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting! [runs into the 90-degree angle road. Sits down with scallops flying around his head] Sitting, sitting. Bleeding. [hears noise] Hey, who's there? [hears another raspberry] Okay, that's enough! [hears another raspberry] Don't come closer! [hears another raspberry] I'm warning you! [hears another raspberry] I'm a sponge! [a red light shines around SpongeBob. It's the friendly creature from before that chased after the balloon] Oh, it's only you. [the creature ties balloon to SpongeBob's wrist] Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem. [the creature begins blowing balloon bigger] I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon... [raspberry] has... [raspberry] enough... [raspberry] air... [raspberry] thanks. [gives a few more raspberries as he is floating up] Hey, I get it, balloon travel! Thank... [raspberry] you! [raspberry]
Creature: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob, with the balloon still tied to his wrist, floats all the way back home] Ah, home at last. [balloon pops]
Patrick: [riding another bus to Rock Bottom] Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya!


SpongeBob: [runs outside to retrieve the newspaper] Gary, the paper's here! [Gary comes out on a motorized skateboard. SpongeBob gives him the paper but keeps the rubber band.] You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section! [shakes the rubber band around for emphasis. Hums while he stretches the rubber band around the middle of his body and snaps it together, turning him into a bowtie-like shape] I am a happy sponge! [runs around, laughing, while Gary is reading the paper]
Gary: [looking slightly annoyed by SpongeBob by rolling his eyes] Meow! [SpongeBob runs into Patrick, who also has a rubber band stretched around him]
Patrick: I see you got the paper. [his rubber band snaps off]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick. [then his rubber band snaps off as well. Patrick clears his throat] Well, I'd better get going.
Patrick: Yep, see you later. [both walk off but then hear a chirping sound and they both quickly run back, with their hands over their ears]
SpongeBob and Patrick: What did you say?
Patrick: Well, I didn't say anything.
SpongeBob: I didn't say anything, either.
SpongeBob and Patrick: See you later then. [both walk off again and the squeaking noise is heard again, so they both run back. This time, they are angry]
SpongeBob: [Pointing at Patrick] Alright, quit messing with me! I know you said something.
Patrick: Ah, but it is you [points] that is messing with me. [both look down to see the squeaking noise is coming from a shaking branch. Patrick points downward.] That's what's messing with us!
SpongeBob: It's a baby scallop.
Patrick: [lifts up his foot with a threatening look on his face, looking as though he is about to smash the scallop] I'll take care of this!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! It's totally helpless. [takes the baby scallop in his hands] It looks like he can't even fly yet.
Patrick: What's the matter, is he stupid?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just a baby. [close-up of the chirping scallop in SpongeBob's hands] He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
Patrick: Well, we can't just leave him out here.
SpongeBob: You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple. [both run in and set the baby scallop on the ground] Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in. [SpongeBob removes his pants and sets it in front of the scallop] There you go. It's the best seat [points to his rear] in the house. [scene cuts to Gary, who does a rimshot]
Patrick: Let me see! [Patrick sticks his whole head inside SpongeBob's pants] Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh! [takes his head out, which is now eaten on the side] I think somebody's hungry!
SpongeBob: [takes out Junior and speaks in baby-talk to it] Is it true? Are you hungry?
Junior: [chirping happily] Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!
SpongeBob: I've got just the thing. [puts Junior on a barrel and takes out a Krabby Patty] How would you like a Krabby Patty? [Junior yelps]
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!
SpongeBob: Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty. [shows Junior a minuscule Krabby Patty]
Junior: [sniffs the patty, then sticks his tongue out in disgust] Blech!
SpongeBob: Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before. [gobbles it and gulps it down]
Patrick: [holds up a doughnut] Let's try a doughnut. [Junior hisses]
SpongeBob: [holds up a tray of French fries] French fries?
Junior: [shaking his head] Unh-unh.
Patrick: [eating the doughnut] A doughnut? [Junior blows a raspberry]
SpongeBob: [holds up an apple] All we have left is this apple. [a worm pokes its head out of the apple]
Worm: Hello, sea creatures! I bring you greetings from Apple World! [Junior chirps in excitement]
SpongeBob: Of course! Scallops love worms. [picks up the worm]
Worm: Huh, wait! We will bury you! [SpongeBob drops it in Junior's mouth]
SpongeBob: Well, you should be good for the rest of the... [Junior cries]
Patrick: What now?
SpongeBob: I don't know! Aww, don't cry. [Junior is still crying]
Patrick: Do something, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah! Look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo! Look at the funny face! [shows SpongeBob has a puppet that looks like him on his hand] Look at the funny face!
Patrick: Wait! I think I might know the problem. [picks up Junior and looks at him] Yep, that's it, alright. [hides it behind his back] Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new. [Junior has a diaper on]
SpongeBob: How did you know?
Patrick: How do you think? [drops his pants showing that he is wearing a diaper] And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.
SpongeBob: Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
Patrick: I know, good thing there's two of us.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
Patrick: Yeah. At least until it's old enough to be on its own. Oh, I wanna be the mom!
SpongeBob: I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
Patrick: You're right. If I was a mom..., [the camera draws back to reveal Patrick's hairy, obese, unsightly form]...this would be kind of shocking. [lifts his arms, revealing armpit hair] Just call me Daddy!
Montage:
Patrick: [softly, from inside the house] It sure is cute when it's asleep.
SpongeBob: [softly, from inside the house] Yeah. [SpongeBob and Patrick watch Junior sleeping] Shh! [both tiptoe out of the room]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob? [goes to what appears to be the right side of the bed]
SpongeBob: [goes to what appears to be the left side] Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.
SpongeBob: Me neither.
[scene zooms out, revealing that Patrick is sleeping on the bottom mattress and SpongeBob is sleeping on the top]
Patrick: Well, good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick. [SpongeBob's mattress slams shut on top of Patrick. Scene cuts to morning] Patrick, breakfast is ready. [SpongeBob is cooking something over at the grill as Patrick walks in, noticing the bunch of food that is on the table]
Patrick: Alright! All this parenting stuff makes me hungry. [lifts the table up as all the food slides down into mouth. He burps, then pats Junior] Hey, Junior, how are you doing today? [smells an odor from Junior] SpongeBob? [adjusts his tie]
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Kid's got a stinky.
SpongeBob: [doing many chores at the same time] Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full. [Patrick guzzles down the coffee as Junior begins to cry]
Patrick: [drinking coffee] Ahh. Wish I could, but I gotta get going.
SpongeBob: Going? Where are you going?
Patrick: [puts on a suit and takes his briefcase] I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?
SpongeBob: You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?
Patrick: I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable. [chuckles as he closes the door]
SpongeBob: Okay. [chuckles weakly. Day turns into night, and Patrick walks in and takes his jacket and hat off]
Patrick: Phew! What a day.
SpongeBob: Oh, great, you're home. Now you can help me with the baby.
Patrick: Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to, but I'm totally beat from work.
SpongeBob: Huh? [Patrick sits down and watches TV. A coconut "clonk" sound effect is heard.]
Patrick: [laughs] That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing the chores] Patrick, what about my break?
Patrick: Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise.
SpongeBob: Uhh, okay, tomorrow.
Narrator: Tomorrow... [scene cuts to Patrick walking in at night and taking his stuff off]
Patrick: Phew! Another tough day. [walks by SpongeBob, who is still doing the same chores from yesterday]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break.
Patrick: Work was a killer. I need my chair. [sits down and watches TV again]
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing chores] Patrick, I really need my...
Patrick: Tomorrow for sure.
Narrator: Tomorrow for sure... [scene cuts to a tired SpongeBob doing the same chores as Patrick walks by]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: I'll get to it eventually...
Narrator: Eventually... [scene cuts to SpongeBob still doing the chores but even more tired]
SpongeBob: Uhhh?
Patrick: Uhhh.
Narrator: Uhhh... [scene cuts to Patrick watching TV as an angry SpongeBob walks in and turns on the lights]
SpongeBob: Patrick Star, we need to talk.
Patrick: Just one more minute, I gotta...
SpongeBob: Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man! [turns off the TV]
Patrick: Hey, I'm missin' the coconut! [he gives SpongeBob an angry look]
SpongeBob: You haven't been helping at all with Junior! [pulls in baby stroller] We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.
Patrick: I changed his diaper!
SpongeBob: Yeah, once.
Patrick: He's only this big. [shows with his hands on how big Junior is] How many diapers could he possibly use?
SpongeBob: [opens up a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: Oh, that's not so much.
SpongeBob: [points over to the corner of the room where there are two bags and a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: [nervously] So?
SpongeBob: [opens up the refrigerator, full of diapers] Hmmm? [pulls the cover off the couch, revealing it to be diapers] Hmmm? [tears the wallpaper off the wall, revealing a bunch of diapers behind it] Hmmm?! [points outside to a garbage truck loading a bunch of diapers into the dumpster. Patrick quivers at the sight of it]
Patrick: [his eyes fill with tears] I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh! [sobs as he looks at SpongeBob as he smiles] I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise. [scene cuts to next day]
SpongeBob: So, what's the plan for the day?
Patrick: No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal.
SpongeBob: [gives Patrick his briefcase as he departs] Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: [waving] Six o'clock.
Patrick: [waving] Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock. [cuts to a time card]
Narrator: 12:00 midnight.
[Patrick walks in with a lampshade over his head, giggling and turns on the light]
Patrick: Oh, that was some party! [SpongeBob is wearing his mother-like clothing and he gives Patrick a bitter look] Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior. [SpongeBob now looks at Patrick angrily as he taps his foot] What? What?!
SpongeBob: Oh, nothing.
Patrick: Oh, what a relief. [takes the lampshade off his head and puts it on SpongeBob] For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.
SpongeBob: [takes the lampshade off his head] Do you remember what you said to me this morning?
Patrick: Somethin' about root beer, right?
SpongeBob: [takes a deep breath, flatly] No.
Patrick: Oh, wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.
SpongeBob: Does... [imitates Patrick in a mocking tone with a goofy look on his face] "You can take the night off, pal!" [normal voice] ...ring a bell?
Patrick: [raspberry] I don't need this. [walks outside]
SpongeBob: What?! [walks to the door] Where do you think you're going?
Patrick: [opens his rock] I'm going back to work! [gets in and closes his rock]
SpongeBob: Work?! [growls and rips off his hairpiece]
[Cut to SpongeBob, not wearing his mother-like clothing anymore, walking outside to Patrick's rock. He opens it up, and finds Patrick in his easy chair, watching TV]
Patrick: [two "clonk" sounds are heard on the TV; laughs] He got hit in the head with two coconuts!
SpongeBob: [angrily] So, this is work?
Patrick: You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes, I gotta move the antenna, sometimes, I lose the remote, [looks at his rear] and sometimes, my butt itches real bad!
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Oh, you poor, poor thing. By the way, you forgot your briefcase! [he pulls a briefcase out from behind his back, and opens it up to reveal that it is filled with donuts and ice cream sundaes as he angrily dumps it all over Patrick]
Patrick: [quietly but furiously] Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?
[SpongeBob is enraged. He balls his fists and fumes so hard, his entire body shakes. Then he loses his temper and goes ballistic on Patrick, and his face morphs into a stereotypical Asian face with lots of teeth.]
SpongeBob: [Screaming intensely] OVERTIME?!
[SpongeBob jumps into Patrick's rock, and they both begin to argue intensely.]
Patrick: Yeah, overtime, pal!
SpongeBob: [overlapping Patrick] Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!
Patrick: You know what that means?
SpongeBob: And that's the kind of work you're doing?
Patrick: ​It means working when you're just too tired to work!
SpongeBob: Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!
[Junior is heard beginning to chirp]
Patrick: You just keep going on working and working!
SpongeBob: ​You never help! NEVER!
[Junior's chirping intensifies, which makes the two finally stop arguing and listen to it]
Patrick: [still mad] There's that stupid noise again!
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.
[Patrick and SpongeBob see Junior teetering on the edge of the window of SpongeBob's house, ready to fly.]
Patrick: [calmly] Oh.
[All at once, Patrick and SpongeBob are struck with shock by what's really happening.]
Both: [eyes bulge in horror, screaming] JUNIOR!
[Junior jumps down the window. SpongeBob and Patrick quickly run to catch Junior but they slam on SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob then bounces out of Patrick's stomach]
SpongeBob: [Frantic] Did you catch him?!
Patrick: [looking sadly at his empty hands] No.
Both: We're bad parents! [They break down sobbing. Then they stop when they notice that chirping Junior is flying above them.]
SpongeBob: Junior? He's flying!
Patrick: I guess he's all grown up. [Junior kisses SpongeBob then flies off] Hey, what about Daddy? [Junior drops a coconut on Patrick's head for his laziness then kisses him] That's my boy.
SpongeBob: Goodbye!
Patrick: [the coconut falls down] Goodbye, Junior!
[they watch Junior fly away]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.
Patrick: This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.
SpongeBob: Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.
Patrick: Yeah... Let's have another.
[SpongeBob looks shocked]


SpongeBob: [reading a story to Gary] And then, the ugly mollusk ran all the way home...
Patrick: [breaking through SpongeBob's wall] SpongeBob, you gotta see this! It's an emergency broadcast on my TV!
TV announcer: The day you've been waiting for is almost here. That's right. Glove World! has a new ride. It's big... [roller coaster goes above the water then back down into it]
TV announcer: It's fast... [Nancy and Harold are riding a roller coaster so fast, Harold flies off of it]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Harold, no!
TV announcer: It's painful... [roller coaster crashes into the ground, causing an explosion]
TV announcer: It's the "Fiery Fist O' Pain." Opening tomorrow only at Glove World!
Patrick: Tomorrow! SpongeBob, we gotta get to bed so we can be first in line! [Patrick hangs onto his TV and goes back to his rock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob sleeping]
SpongeBob: Glove World! Roller coaster. First in line. [SpongeBob dreams of him and Patrick at Glove World!. When they walk past the popcorn stand, it turns into a maggot stand and smoke fills the air]
Dream SpongeBob: Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain? [Grim reaper points to his left. SpongeBob and Patrick float over to the ride. When they get in it, it goes up above the water. They scream as it goes down. Lightning strikes the tracks, and makes the roller coaster fly off the track]
Dream SpongeBob: In the name of amusement, no...! [SpongeBob and Patrick fall out of the coaster and into graves with their names on the tombstones. A digger puts all the dirt back in the hole]
SpongeBob: [screams] I don't want to ride the Fist Of Pain! [cut to next morning when SpongeBob's alarm goes off but he didn't sleep the whole night. Patrick appears by his bed]
Patrick: You ready to ride the Fist O' Pain?
SpongeBob: No! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night.
Patrick: Really? Me too!
SpongeBob: What was your dream about, Patrick?
Patrick: Oh, look, the bus is here! [runs toward the bus]
SpongeBob: Wait for me, Patrick. [both get on the bus] Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come.
Timmy Monroe: Yeah, dudes, we're all riding the Fist O' Pain.
Boy #2: I heard somebody rode it and his spine fell out.
Timmy: [laughing] Dude, I hope my spine falls out.
Taylor: [laughing] Yeah, me too.
SpongeBob: Boy, the Fist O' Pain sounds...
Patrick: Really, really scary. I mean fun-ifying. I mean horror-tastic. I mean fun-ible! Fun, really, really fun.
SpongeBob: Yeah, really fun. [bus stops at Glove World! and SpongeBob &amp; Patrick get off]
SpongeBob: That sure looks like fun.
Patrick: Yeah, I can't wait to ride it. [all the passengers on the bus run out and grab SpongeBob &amp; Patrick while cheering]
All: Yes, we're here! Whoo! [SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are carries into a brick wall]
Employee: Tickets, please. [SpongeBob looks in his pockets but no ticket]
SpongeBob: No tickets. I must have left it at home.
Patrick: I swallowed my tickets.
SpongeBob: I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today.
Nat: Hold on a second, there's your tickets in your back pockets. [grabs them both]
SpongeBob: Oh, barnacles!. [cut to later when SpongeBob and Patrick are walking around the amusement park] It sure was lucky we found our tickets.
Patrick: Yeah, bad luck. I mean good luck, very good luck.
SpongeBob: There it is. The line looks awfully long.
Patrick: Oh, I know! Let's go on some of the dumb kiddie rides first.
SpongeBob: Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler. [both run off]
Patrick: Phew.
SpongeBob: Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?
Patrick: Yeah, only a real baby would be afraid of a roll... Whoa!
SpongeBob: I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove! [a giant glove costume is standing in front of them] Get over there and I'll take your picture with him. [Patrick moves a few steps into the camera so he's not too close to Glovey Glove] Get closer, Patrick.
Patrick: Nuh-uh.
SpongeBob: Come on, closer. [Patrick moves a little closer] That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile. [takes the picture]
Patrick: How do I look? [pictures shows Patrick touching Glovey Glove with only a finger] Wow, I look great. [a little kid is laughing on one of the kiddie rides]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: The Mitten!
SpongeBob: [clears throat] I mean, The Mitten.
Patrick: That ride's for babies.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is. [both walk over and get into the ride, with the little kid. When they go over a bump, they scream. When the ride is over, they get out and both are shivering; the baby snaps his fingers at SpongeBob and Patrick and walks away]
Patrick: I guess that ride was too much for the little guy. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in line by the Fiery Fist O' Pain]
SpongeBob: Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride? [both chuckle nervously]
Patrick: Yeah, it's perfectly safe. No one gets hurt riding these roller coasters. [an old fish is wheel chaired out of Glove World!]
Old Man Walker: Oh, why, why, why? [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run off] Why won't you let me on the ride?
Harold: Sir, you have a serious medical condition.
Old Man Walker: But it's my birthday! [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick running through a line, cheering]
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: One more time!
Tom: You know, this is the line for the bathroom.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We've gone eight times.
Patrick: And I went three times all by myself.
Tom: I'm going to walk away now. [does so]
SpongeBob: Bye.
Patrick: Have fun! [Larry walks up]
Larry: SpongeBob! Patrick!
SpongeBob: Hello, Larry.
Larry: I just got off the Fist O' Pain. Man, what a rush. [sniffs his armpit then sighs in relief as a green odor is released from under his arm] You smell that? That's the smell of adrenaline. [SpongeBob's and Patrick's eyebrows disintegrate]
SpongeBob: Oh, it's, uh... [holding breath] very manly, Larry.
Larry: [picks up SpongeBob and smells him] SpongeBob, I'm not smelling any adrenaline on you. You haven't gone on the ride?
SpongeBob: Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry! [runs off]
Larry: Come on, Patrick. You and me, pal?
Patrick: I'm hungry, too. [runs off]
Larry: Maybe I should stop making people smell me. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting at a table, eating ice cream, and looking at the explosions on the Fist O' Pain]
Patrick: Want some?
SpongeBob: No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows.
Patrick: Yeah, that's the problem with this brand. I'll be right back. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Hurry back so we can go on the ride. [sees the roller coaster drop and plants his face in the table]
Ice Cream: [SpongeBob talks to himself, SpongeBob voices the ice cream] What's the matter, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do.
Ice Cream: Patrick's your best friend. You can't let him down.
SpongeBob: I know, but the ride is really scary.
Ice Cream: You wanna see scary? I'll show you scary! [hits himself in the head with the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ice Cream: You like that? You like that? Huh, you like that? [cut to the bathroom where Patrick is talking to himself in the mirror]
Patrick: It's just a ride. What are you so scared about? You can do it.
Reflection: No you can't. You're a big crybaby.
Patrick: Oh, yeah? [punches his reflection, without breaking the glass] I thought we'd settled this the last time! [cut to SpongeBob still hitting himself in the head with the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!
Patrick: [runs back] SpongeBob, I have to tell you something.
SpongeBob: I have to tell you something too, Patrick.
Henry: [over speaker] Attention. Glove World! will be closing in five minutes.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Five minutes?! [both run over to the ride. An employee comes over and cleans up the ice cream]
Ice Cream: What are you looking at? [cut to the ride]
SpongeBob: [reads the sign] Warning! This ride may cause: Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas...
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: ...and explosive diarrhea. [explosion is heard]
SpongeBob: Is that all?
Patrick: Big deal, I did half that stuff this morning.
Henry: [over speaker] Last call for the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
SpongeBob: Well, this is it, Pat.
Patrick: Yep.
SpongeBob: Here we go.
Patrick: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: On the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
Patrick: After you. [both sit down in the ride]
SpongeBob: We made it.
Patrick: Yeah.
Employee #3: Please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times. [buckles them, puts on helmets, and wraps them up] There.
Employee #4: Now if you could just sign this release, involving Glove World! in case of accidental spine loss... [SpongeBob signs his name] Well, nice knowing you.
Employee #3: Ready in ten...
SpongeBob: This is it, Patrick.
Employee #3: Nine, eight...
SpongeBob: We made it!
Employee #3: Seven, six...
Patrick: We're not scaredy cats.
Employee #3: Five, four...
SpongeBob: We're not crybabies.
Employee #3: Three, two...
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: We're brave!
Employee #3: One... [when he presses the 'GO' button, SpongeBob and Patrick scream, but the roller coaster breaks down]
Henry: [over speaker] Uh, we're experiencing some technical difficulties.
Employee #3: Man, this cheap thing is always breaking down. Hey, sorry, guys. Maybe next time. [SpongeBob and Patrick sigh in relief]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride.
Patrick: Me too.
SpongeBob: I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you.
Patrick: I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.
SpongeBob: But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.
Patrick: Yeah! [employee comes back]
Employee #3: Oh, wait, it's fine.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Huh?
Employee #3: Have fun. [presses the 'GO' button again. SpongeBob and Patrick take off but their wrapping and helmets have come off]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them! [when they get to the top, it stops for a moment] Goodbye, Patrick.
Patrick: Goodbye, SpongeBob. [Coaster starts again, dropping and going through a saw, a flaming fist, and a laser. When the coaster drops at a 90 degree angle, SpongeBob and Patrick's skeletons fly through the air while their bodies go down with the coaster. Their skeletons fly into them as they go up, out of the water, but when they sit up, they have the other one's skeleton. The coaster drops into the ground, causing an explosion. When the ride is over, SpongeBob &amp; Patrick are holding each other, shaking]
Woman: [over speaker] Please wait until the car has come to a complete stop. And stop crying!
Employee #3: It's over. You can get out now.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: We did it! [both get out and run around in circles]
SpongeBob: We conquered our fears!
Patrick: We stopped crying!
SpongeBob: We survived the Fist o' Pain!
Employee #3: Hey, hold it right there! You forgot these.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Our spines! [grab their spines] Yeah! [when they grab them, they start to wiggle their bodies and then bend them backwards. They laugh]
SpongeBob: Let's go again!
Patrick: Yeah!


[A humanized pink starfish in a suit walks up and knocks on Patrick's rock.]
Patrick: Yeah?
Starfish: Good day, sir. I am...
Patrick: [gasp] I know exactly who you are! [closes rock]
SpongeBob: Ah, there's nothing like spending quality time with my Gare-Gare.
Lady on TV: Jason, I have to be honest. There's someone else. [grabs an elderly fish]
Man on TV: Grandpa!
Patrick: [pokes head out of TV] SpongeBob, help! He's onto me! I don't have much time! [pants. Makes a fire in SpongeBob's living room and burns some of his books]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I have to get rid of these books! [shows 'HOW TO READ' book]
SpongeBob: Why?
Patrick: I'll show you why. [shoves SpongeBob's face into his window looking at the pink starfish] See him? He's from the library. He knows about my overdue books. [SpongeBob gasps] Uh-huh. Which means I'm gonna get thrown into the big house. And you know what that means...
SpongeBob: Small portion meals?
Patrick: Exactly! [crying]
SpongeBob: Patrick, don't you worry. I got your back, man. [later, SpongeBob approaches the starfish outside] Hi there.
Starfish: Salutations, young one. Say, you wouldn't happen to know that starfish that lives under this rock, would you?
SpongeBob: Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this "alleged" starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books. [SpongeBob slams his hands over his mouth]
Starfish: [chuckles] Well, it's too bad you don't know Patrick Star, because I am from the Royal Ministry, and have a gift for him. [takes out a crown]
Patrick: [runs through SpongeBob's wall] Ooh, what is it? [takes it and tries to bite and lick it] This is the worst-tasting gift ever!
Starfish: That's because you're suppose to wear it, not eat it. Allow me to show you something. [the starfish searches around in his pants] Let's see here. Aha! What I hold in my hands is a family tree that goes back centuries. It starts with the marriage of King Amoeba and Queen Mildew. Then, through a few inbred generations, ends at you, Sir Patrick, which makes you a descendant of royalty. You are a king. And now it's time I adjourn to the Royal Ministry, where I should be at your service. Your Highness. [the starfish bows and leaves]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, that's great!
Patrick: What is?
SpongeBob: That you're king!
Patrick: What's a king?
SpongeBob: When you're a king, you can get anything you want.
Patrick: Anything I want? [stomach grumbles] SpongeBob, do you think we can get something to eat?
SpongeBob: Your wish is my command, your majesty. [laughing. Cut to Krusty Krab where SpongeBob enters with medieval clothes on] Good townspeople, let us rejoice in welcoming our new king. [Patrick enters, wearing his crown and a royal cloak]
Patrick: King needs food badly.
Mr. Krabs: What's this all ab... [gasps. Sees Patrick's crown and dollar signs appear in his eyes] Well, well, well. What can I do for you, Patrick?
SpongeBob: The king would like...
Mr. Krabs: Zip it, SquarePants... I'm talking to the rich guy.
Patrick: I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries...
Mr. Krabs: I've got a better idea. [cut to a bunch of food on the table and Patrick chewing loudly] A buffet fit for a king.
Patrick: [belches] Tasty.
Mr. Krabs: Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down. You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to.
Patrick: Uh-huh, that sounds great. Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?
Mr. Krabs: [holds a check] How about you pay the check, instead?
Patrick: Oh, sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do. As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want. Isn't that right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free.
Mr. Krabs: All free?!!? [kicks them out] Nobody eats in me restaurant for free, king or no king! [Harold walks out with a drink and Krabby Patty]
Patrick: Are you gonna eat that?
Harold: I was planning to, why?
Patrick: I want it. [takes them]
Harold: Hey! What gives you the right to take my food?
Patrick: [eats the Krabby Patty] Tell him, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about.
Patrick: I thought you said I could have anything I want. Was my bestest friend lying to me?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you.
Patrick: Good! Now tell him.
SpongeBob: Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants. [chuckles]
Harold: This isn't fair. [walks off]
Patrick: Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it.
Fish: I finally did it! At long last, I've acquired issue #2 of Wonder Space Fish, and in mint condition. Now my 40 year-old life and my comic book collection are complete. Mom's gonna be so proud of me. [bumps into Patrick]
Patrick: No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!
Fish: But, I've spent my entire life collecting those.
Patrick: Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it. I'm the king!
Fish: I will cry about it. [crying] I'll cry right to my mom! [runs off, cries]
Patrick: [laughs] I love being king.
[Cut to the jewelery store where the owner is examining a diamond. SpongeBob then shows him the decree and he gives it to Patrick, who puts it in his belly button. Then, SpongeBob takes some lollipops from some kids and Patrick starts licking them. Then SpongeBob shows the decree to Martha Smith, who sadly gives her baby to Patrick, who then takes out the baby's pacifier and gives the wailing baby back to her. Then Patrick takes a plunger, a toaster, and dentures. Soon, a long line of people are standing with things to give to Patrick in front of his rock, which now has a castle tower fixed to it]
SpongeBob: Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker.
Old Man Walker: I hope so. Neptune knows I did. [falls over] Oof!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, sire?
Patrick: [slurping a drink and reading a magazine] I need your opinion on something. Do you think the giant flat-screen TV should go over the fancy egg display or the indoor swimming pool? [cut to Squidward sleeping then waking up to birds chirping and the sun shining]
Squidward: Hello, sunshine. [chuckles then yawns as he walks over to his window] What a beautiful morning. Just perfect. [Squidward falls over from side to side in his house. Patrick is using a crane to move Squidward's house out of the way]
Patrick: Back. Back. Okay. Yeah, that's good. [crane drops the house] Perfect. [Squidward climbs out of his upstairs window]
Squidward: [stuttering] My-my-my house. What's happened to my...huh? [he sees SpongeBob and Patrick. He growls their names] SpongeBob, Patrick.[explodes] What the barnacles is going on here?! Look at what you've done. Look at my poor front yard.
Patrick: Your front yard?
SpongeBob: Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel.
Squidward: Ferris Wheel?!
SpongeBob: I know, isn't it great?
Squidward: No, it's not great! It's horrible! Oh, that's it! Stop! People of Bikini Bottom, stop! Stop! Patrick's no king. Look at him. How can this pink blob be king?
Patrick: [looking stupidly] Uh...
Squidward: [Rushes to a worker, on his knees, and grabs his shirt.]You. Do you honestly believe that that mindless starfish can possibly be the king of anything? [Patrick puts his hand in his mouth.] King of Morons, maybe.
Worker: He might be on to something.
Squidward: Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, see? Uh-huh. See? [Squidward then notices that the crowd willingly agrees.]
Crowd: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Man: Why are we giving this guy all our stuff? [The crowd angrily walks away.]
Squidward: See? See? You're not a king. And now, they all think so, [long pause] too!
Patrick: [enraged] Get him! Attack! Attack! [panting with Squidward giving a confused facial expression.] SpongeBob, get him! So I decree. Attack!
SpongeBob: Uh, right away, your majesty. [SpongeBob rushes towards Squidward.] Umm, Squidward?
Squidward: [gritting his teeth] What?
SpongeBob: Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick?
Squidward: [takes decree] Give me that! A treaty, huh? Well, here's what I think of your treaty! [As he rolls it up and shoves it onto SpongeBob's face. Cut to inside Patrick's castle where SpongeBob has the treaty stuck in his forehead.]
Patrick: [rage takes over] My royal subjects have deserted me. And it's all 'cause of that horrible Squidward. This is all his fault. His, his, not mine, his! [crackling, bangs]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what's happened to you?
Patrick: I don't know what you mean.
SpongeBob: Uh... [laughs] You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and...
Patrick: And what...
SpongeBob: [intimidated of Patrick's rage] And, um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk.
Patrick: Huh? [laughs] I thought you were going to say I was abusing my power.
SpongeBob: Uh...well, I...
Patrick: [explodes] Who's saying I'm abusing my power!? [SpongeBob shrinks and Patrick rips off his cloak] I'll put the whole town in prison! [SpongeBob runs away] Questioning my authority is reason! All these giggly speeches are making me thirsty. SpongeBob, I request a drink. SpongeBob? [claps twice] SpongeBob?! Huh. Gee, everybody's gone. I'm all alone. Fine, I'll get it myself! [walks by the mirror, and his reflection looks like a monster]
Mirror: Knock knock.
Patrick: Huh? [gasps] A knock knock joke! [he runs back to the mirror] Who's there?
Mirror: You.
Patrick and Mirror: I don't get it.
Mirror: I'm you and you are me. [a wire in Patrick's head connects and short circuits]
Patrick and Mirror: [screams] What have I become?! [Patrick races out of his rock]
Patrick: Aaah, help! Monster! Monster! [he bumps into the Royal Ministry starfish] Huh? Oh, it's, it's you! [he thrusts the crown at the starfish] Here, here, take it. I don't want it anymore. It's turned me into a monster.
Starfish: Oh, I think I know what's going on here. Patrick, with great power comes great responsibility. [Patrick is shaking and whimpering] You haven't a clue what I just told you, do you?
Patrick: No. Uh-uh.
Starfish: Oh, just as well. I've come to take the crown back, as it seems that you aren't royalty after all.
Patrick: Huh?
Starfish: [takes out family history] I've discovered this coffee stain, which upon removal, reveals that Sir Gary is the true heir to the king's crown. [he removes the stain to show Gary's picture on the family history parchment. Cut to Gary having a crown put on his head, SpongeBob and Patrick dressed in medieval clothes]
SpongeBob: Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty!
Gary: [smiles] Meow?


Voice: SB-129. [episode starts]
Narrator: Ahh, it is Sunday morning in Bikini Bottom, and it is about time for Squidward to practice his clarinet. So get your ear plugs ready.
Squidward: [kisses his clarinet] I think I'll treat Bikini Bottom to some real music. [He gets ready to play his clarinet, and then SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off, sending Squidward's clarinet into his throat] Yow! [Struggles to dislodge the clarinet out of his throat.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing? [Squidward tries to yell, but his clarinet sounds every time he tries to talk] Great! We'll be right over! [Squidward pulls the clarinet out of his throat. Door knocks are heard]
Squidward: I wonder who that could be. [Squidward opens the door]
SpongeBob: Ready to go?
Squidward: No, I'm not "ready to go!" [slams the door]
Patrick: He doesn't wanna play with us.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just not ready. [Squidward tries to play his clarinet, but he hears another knock at the door] Ready now?
Squidward: No! [slams door. Then he goes back to try to play clarinet is interrupted once again by yet another knock at door. Squidward gets angry.]
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No! [slams the door. The knock on the door is heard again] Huh? [opens door]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams the door. Another knock on the door and he opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it] No! [SpongeBob and Patrick are gone and they approach Squidward from behind. SpongeBob taps his shoulder] What?!
SpongeBob: Ready yet?
Squidward: No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?!
SpongeBob: Sure we do.
Squidward: What? [stammers] D'oh...! [shuts the door and leaves his house, then realizes he's outside. He runs back to his door and knocks. SpongeBob opens it]
SpongeBob: Ready? [Squidward slaps his forehead, and then pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out of his house]
Squidward: OUT! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed. [Squidward gets an idea]
Squidward: Hold on a second. I'll be right out. [closes the door. Squidward tiptoes out the other way of his house to the Krusty Krab, and enters] Hello...? [silence] Ahh, alone at last. [tries to play his clarinet, but SpongeBob and Patrick are heard outside]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward? [Squidward runs into the kitchen as SpongeBob and Patrick come in the Krusty Krab and search for Squidward] Squidward! [Squidward runs into the freezer] Squidward? Oh, Squidward! [Squidward peeks out as SpongeBob and Patrick look for him] Squidward!
SpongeBob: Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!
Squidward: A-ha! They're finally gone! [tries to open the freezer, but it's locked from the inside!] What the...? [tries to open it multiple times] Locked?! Oh no! Oh... well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time.
Narrator: 2,000 years later...
[the scene shows Squidward still inside the freezer, frozen; the hinges are rusty, and they fall off; the door falls with Squidward frozen behind it; SpongeTron flies past and then back to Squidward]
Sponge-Tron: Holy Krabby Patties! A frozen cephalopod! [Sponge-Tron grabs a chrome hammer; from the hammer comes a red laser, which melts the ice and hits Squidward's buttocks; Squidward screams]
Squidward: [trancelike] I'll be out of here in no time.
Sponge-Tron: Greetings, primitive.
Squidward: Sp...SpongeBob? Is that you?
Sponge-Tron: SpongeBob? No! [robot voice] I am Sponge-Tron. [normal voice] Welcome to the future!
Squidward: What?
Sponge-Tron: Welcome to the future!
Squidward: Uh, the future... [notices everything's chrome] Huh?! O-okay, uh, what's going on here? Why is everything... chrome?
Sponge-Tron: Everything is chrome in the future!
Squidward: Wha...? [stammers and runs to look outside a window] Oh, my... [notices the chrome environment. The screen pans around the chrome environment.] Impossible! He's lying! [A flower pops up from underground, then a truck comes, a fish gets out of the truck, runs up to the flower, sprays it with chrome spray paint, then runs back in the truck and drives away. Squidward looks at the screen.] He's right!
SpongeTron: Of course I'm right, Squidward! Just ask my clones: Sponge-Trons X, Y, and Z. [Squidward flinches as a trio of Sponge-Tron clones have suddenly appeared next to them]
Squidward: Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here?
Sponge-Tron: Sure! All 486 of them! [A calendar on the wall says March 6, 4017 A.D. This means Squidward was entered the freezer back in March 6, 2017. Squidward does a few sit-ups while he talks as if he is trying to wake up]
Squidward: [Lays down and starts doing sit-ups] Future! Future! Future! Future! [SpongeTron drops a brick on Squidward's head] Thanks. Now listen! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake! Please, we've got to do something!
Sponge-Trons X, Y, and Z: [pull out jellyfishing nets] Jellyfishing! [a two-headed Patrick appears out of nowhere]
Pat-Tron: Did somebody say, "jellyfishing"?
Sponge-Tron: Hi, Pat-Tron!
Squidward: J-just listen to me! I'm not supposed to be here! I've gotta get home to my own time period! I've gotta go!
Sponge-Tron: Well, why didn't you just ask? The time machine is down the hall, to the left. [Squidward runs to the door, laughs and enters, but the sound of a can-opener being used is heard. Squidward steps out and is torn into pieces, now appearing like a spring-shaped patch of skin] Oops! Oh, yeah, that one's the can opener... but try the one on the right. [Squidward tries the door on the right and enters a pink and green room that has a slot-looking machine that says "past" and "future" with a key near the slot]
Squidward: Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior... [notices time-travel handle] Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past! [Squidward turns the key and puts the lever on "past." Siren goes off as time machine disappears from where it used to be in the Krusty Krab. Sponge-Tron waves at Squidward. The door and the wall fly through a hyperspace-like warp, then the time machine appears in a primitive Bikini Bottom.]
Squidward: [looks out and sees an Ammonite swim by. Whales calls can be heard] Wow, primitive. Has sort of an old-world charm. [a snake-like creature swims by really close to Squidward's face] Whoa! I guess this is before manners were invented! Well, at least there's no sign of SpongeBrat. Maybe now I can finally be alone with my clarinet. [hears a noise, turns around, but some shadow quickly hides. He hears another noise and checks again, but a different shadow hides] Huh? [one of the shadow figures swing from tree to tree] Huh? What?! [a shadow figure hides behind a tree] Huh!? [the other shadow figure hides behind a ledge. Squidward keeps walking and then notices a Prehistoric Sponge on the ground] SpongeBob? [Primate Sponge screams] Stay back! [Primate Sponge touches Squidward's arm and then sniffs his finger from what he touched. Tries to give some to Squidward] Uh, no thanks. [Squidward feels someone breathing on him and he turns and notices a Prehistoric Starfish breathing on him. Prehistoric Starfish smiles and reveals nasty, rotten teeth] Uh, hi there. Well, I better be going now. [Prehistoric Sponge grabs Squidward's tentacle] Yes, that's my arm. [Prehistoric Sponge puts Squidward's arm on his head and Prehistoric Starfish licks his hand] Oh, that's sweet. [Prehistoric Starfish gets scared; he smashes on the ground and gets the shivers] What, is it time for your flea bath now? [a jellyfish swims by and Prehistoric Starfish ducks for protection] Oh, look, it's just a little jellyfish. [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish run around screaming] Well, I'm going away now. [Squidward walks away] Ah, here's a nice, shady spot, away from those fools!
[Squidward plays his clarinet and each time he tries to play, Primate Sponge or Prehistoric Starfish holler, who are each giving a turn at holding the jellyfish]
Squidward: What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are confused] Give me those loincloths! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish tear off a piece of their loincloth] I can't believe it. [mumbles to self. Crafts the loincloth jellyfishing nets. Shows them the nets.] This oughta make things go a little smoother! [gives Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish their nets. They put the nets on their lips. Squidward facepalms and grabs the nets back] Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this! [Squidward catches the jellyfish in one of the loincloth nets] It's called jellyfishing. [Primate SpongeBob and Prehistoric Starfish grab the nets and chase the jellyfish] Ah, finally. [sits on the ground and plays his clarinet. Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish hear it, go berserk and chase Squidward. Squidward runs into the time machine as Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish try to get in by climbing on top of it; Squidward screams] Get me outta here! [frantically jams lever up and down and accidentally snaps it off] Uh-oh. [the word FUTURE spins like a slot machine, and stops on 2 lemons and a "BAR"]
Time Machine: Loser! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are banging on the time machine trying to get to Squidward until it disappears into thin-air. The time machine shakes from the inside, with Squidward scared. The camera zooms in, with a "paint" effect, then camera is on Squidward's face, and a color change effect goes off. The screen flashes white, and the machine goes through all sorts of dimensions, with one with a computer-like area, then the screen does a color change effect again, with the time machine folding like paper, and it vanishes with a zap sound.]
[Squidward appears in a blank, white space. He walks around, and hears a strange voice. He then notices some colored tiles and lifts one up and it floats and vanishes]
Squidward: He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all... [Squidward becomes tiny] ...alone! [a bunch of "alone" sayings appear with a different voice as each comes up]
Voices: Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! [Continuous "Alone" chanting is heard, as the screen continuously gets smaller and smaller]
Squidward: I gotta get outta of here! [Squidward tries to run, but he runs off and on the scene. He stops and tries to catch his breath. A strange voice is heard again, he holds his head, sweats a little, and runs again off and on the scene. He stops running after three tries to get out, yet another strange voice is heard when he stops] Where's the time machine?! Where's anything?! Where, where, where, where?! [jumps up and down angrily and busts a hole through the ground into the time machine. The handle is still broken off. Squidward bangs on the broken controls and sobs] I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob! [right when Squidward says "SpongeBob," the time machine disappears and reappears in present time Bikini Bottom where SpongeBob and Patrick are still waiting for Squidward in front of his house] SpongeBob! Patrick!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys.
SpongeBob: Does this mean you wanna go...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Jellyfishing?
Squidward: No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?
SpongeBob and Patrick: You are, Squidward! [They laugh as the scene cuts to the little island on the surface]
Squidward: I'm going back.


[The title card has men singing part of the song "Sailing Over the Dogger Bank"] ♪Watcha twigger she's a proper jubby-jewel... On a passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby!♪ [then we see the Krusty Krab at night]
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's the worst time of the day once again. [cringes as he changes the "Open" sign to "Closed"] Closing time!
SpongeBob: Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, SpongeBob! [pulls SpongeBob back] Take that pile of filth out with you. [Squidward holds up a trash bag with flies flying around it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!
Squidward: He means this filth, you loon! [He drops the bag on the floor]
[SpongeBob goes to the dumpster while bringing the trash bag]
SpongeBob: [singing] Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash.
[SpongeBob throws the trash in the dumpster and then looks at some writings on the dumpster.]
SpongeBob: Hmm... dumpster writing! The voice of the people! "Up with bubbles, down with air!" [laughs] "Nematodes are people too!" [laughs] Ha, those nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells. [writes the word "good" after "smells"] Good. [laughs] Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a [dolphin chirp].
Garbage man: [Clearly disgusted] Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
[picks up multiple garbage bags and leaves]
SpongeBob: Well, sometimes, but not... Recently.
Patrick: [off-screen] Hi, garbage man. [appears on-screen] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?
Patrick: "Krabs..." Uh, isn't that the red, sweaty guy you work for?
SpongeBob: [pointing to "Krabs," then the unseen word as they are said] Nah-uh, not that word, that word.
Patrick: Hmm... [dolphin chirp]! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.
SpongeBob: Sentence enhancers?
Patrick: You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-O! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!
SpongeBob: Oh, I get it! Let me try. [clears his throat] Hello, Patrick. Lovely [dolphin chirp] day we're having, isn't it?
Patrick: Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This [dolphin chirp] day is particularly [dolphin chirp] lovely!
SpongeBob: How [dolphin chirp] right you are, Patrick!
[The two continue to say the word a few more times]
SpongeBob: Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation.
Patrick: Oh, mine, too!
[both laugh]
SpongeBob: It tingles when I laugh!
[SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab the next day]
SpongeBob: Hello, customers, nice [dolphin chirp] day we're having, uh? [The customers stop eating and stare in shock]
Harold: [gasps] Did he just say?!
Pirate fish: Aye, he did.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?
Patrick: [sitting at table at the Krusty Krab] Pretty [dolphin chirp] good, SpongeBob.
Old Man Jenkins: I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.
SpongeBob: [taps on the microphone and speaks into it] Attention, customers, today's special is a [dolphin chirp] Krabby Patty served in a greasy [dolphin chirp] sauce and grilled to [dolphin chirp] perfection. [a mother octopus covers her laughing children's ears and puts soda on one since she doesn't have enough hands] And don't forget to ask us to [dolphin chirp] the [dolphin chirp] fries. It will be our [dolphin chirp] pleasure. [Squidward hears the intercom and a giant human ear pops out of his head; he pushes it back in] Hi, Squidward, how the [dolphin chirp] are ya?
Patrick: Nice [dolphin chirp] day, isn't it, Squidward?
Tom: I don't understand. That guy's talented, he doesn't have to work blue.
Evelyn: Let's go somewhere more family oriented. [Everyone leaves the Krusty Krab, grumbling in frustration]
Female fish: [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] I'm never eating here again.
Male fish: [chattering (variously and) inaudibly] Those foul-mouth bottom feeders.
[The Krusty Krab customer meter is running down; sirens wail and a red light flashes]
Mr. Krabs: [in the bathroom, hears the sirens] Huh? [looks through the periscope, sees that the Krusty Krab is empty and gasps] The Krusty Krab, she's empty! [runs to dining room with toilet paper stuck to one of his legs] All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?
Squidward: Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what was it? What'd he say?
Squidward: Er...he said...um, well he said...
[Squidward whispers]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Squidward whispers it again; Mr. Krabs gasps] SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.
Patrick: Yeah, it's fancy talk.
Mr. Krabs: There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
SpongeBob: You mean [dolphin chirp]?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, that one! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand up] Now quit saying that! [SpongeBob and Patrick frown] It's a bad word!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bad word?! [both start wiping their tongues while moaning]
Mr. Krabs: Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.
Squidward: Don't you mean there are only 7?
Mr. Krabs: Not if you're a sailor. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wow, 13.
Patrick: That's a lot of [dolphin chirp] bad words.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We promise.
[later at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are playing Eels and Escalators]
SpongeBob: Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!
Patrick: Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.
SpongeBob: Yeah, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators.
Patrick: Oh, boy, my favorite! [Flops arms up and down like a seal]
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! [rolls the dice]
Patrick: Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel.
SpongeBob: Darn. [moves game piece to eel]
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Hooray! Escalators! Yay! [screams] Up, up, up!
SpongeBob: Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators! [rolls dice] [sighs] Eels again.
Patrick: My turn! [rolls dice] Escalators!
SpongeBob: Escalators, Escalators, Escalators! [throws dice] Eels?
Patrick: [rolls dice] Es-skee-lators! [moves to escalators] Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!
SpongeBob: [gets frustrated while rolling the dice] Escalators, escalators, escalators! [dice is thrown and lands on escalators] Ha! Escalators! [dice turn over to eels]
Patrick: Eels...
SpongeBob: Ah, [dolphin chirp]! [covers his mouth when he realizes his mistake]
Patrick: Ooooh...! You said number 11!
SpongeBob: [babbles for Patrick to understand] I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob, I understand. [pause] Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [starts running to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [starts running after him] No, wait, Patrick! [after SpongeBob catches up to Patrick] Patrick, no, please don't tell!
Patrick: But, you said "[dolphin chirp]"! [Covers his mouth as he realizes his mistake]
SpongeBob: Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!
Patrick: Not if I tell first!
SpongeBob: I can run faster than you! [laughs]
Patrick: [riding on the back of an ice cream truck] See ya at the Krusty Krab! Hahaha! [the truck turns at the wrong corner] Oh, nooooo!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What, what, what?
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes, yes?
SpongeBob: He said, he said, he said!
Mr. Krabs: Out with it, boy!
SpongeBob: [talking fast] Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things.
Mr. Krabs: [eyes SpongeBob] What kind of things?
SpongeBob: Well, he said...
Mr. Krabs: Yes?!
SpongeBob: Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said.
Mr. Krabs: Uh... right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?
Patrick: [walks in door of the Krusty Krab and eats an ice cream cone, but throws away the cone] Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs sighs]
SpongeBob and Patrick: He said that word that you said we shouldn't say...!
SpongeBob: ...number thirteen...
[They babble on about the word, as Mr. Krabs stares on disapprovingly, until the two are just pointing at each other and yelling, "Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!"; Mr. Krabs eventually grabs their lips to quiet them.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mmm-mmm...!
Mr. Krabs: Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mmm-hmm... [Mr. Krabs lets go of their lips, which initially deflate, then reinflate; they both point at each other again] He said "[dolphin chirp]"!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash. [picks SpongeBob and Patrick up by their pants and carries them outside the Krusty Krab] You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. [walks back in Krusty Krab]
Patrick: What's going to happen to us?
SpongeBob: We'll probably get 40 lashes!
Patrick: Oh, no! [stupidly imagines himself blinking with 40 thick eyelashes]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.
Patrick: I'm sorry, too, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: [shakes hands with SpongeBob] Agreed!
Mr. Krabs: All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for fouling the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom. [jams his foot on a rock then hops on one leg] Ow, Ooh! Ow! My [dolphin chirps] foot! What [dolphin chirps] genius put a [dolphin chirps] rock in a [dolphin chirps] path?! Can't you see I got a [boat horn no. 1] foot here?! Oh! [seal bark. Continues saying a bunch of swear words, censored out by seagulls, foghorns, ship bells, etc.; at this moment, SpongeBob and Patrick count the swear words he uses]
SpongeBob: Five, six, seven...
Mr. Krabs: ...a whole lotta [old-style foghorn] and with a side of [dolphin chirp], a heapin' helpin' of [ship's bell] and a boatload of [boat horn no. 4] ...
Patrick: Nine...
Mr. Krabs:  Ooh [seal bark, seagull squak]crabbin’ [a new-style foghorn] Ooh-hoo-uh! [cries in pain]
SpongeBob: [cuts to SpongeBob with thirteen fingers] That's all thirteen, Patrick! [gasps] We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [worried] No, please, not me mommy! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh as they run to Mama Krabs' house, Mr. Krabs runs after them] Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!
[They go to the house]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [repeatedly banging on the door] Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!
Mama Krabs: Why, hello there!
[SpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs all explain the situation at the same time, swearing numerous times as they do so]
SpongeBob: Mama Krabs, he said [dolphin chirp] and then he said [dolphin chirps] again and said [dolphin chirps] and then he screamed at the top of his voice [foghorn blows]!
Patrick: It was terrible.
SpongeBob: And he-- [horn honks]--Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of [seagull caws, foghorn, ship's bell] I have never heard in my days!
Mama Krabs: [shocked] Oh, dear! My poor old heart. [faints]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you? [takes a coin out of her pocket] You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!
Mama Krabs: [wakes up] You should all be ashamed. And if you're going to talk like sailors, then you're going to work like sailors.
[Then the three are painting her house; Patrick is painting the sand]
Mama Krabs: I guess you scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade. [laughs, then stubs her foot on a rock] Yeeeoww! My [Klaxon horn] foot!
[SpongeBob and Patrick gasp in shock] 
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] Mother!
Mama Krabs: What? It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy.
Old Man Jenkins: [driving by] Howdy, Mrs. K! [honks the horn]
SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Mama Krabs: [all laugh together]


[The episodes begins on another beautiful day at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs once again foils another one of Plankton's attempts to steal the secret Krabby Patty formula and carries him outside through the front doors.]
Mr. Krabs: You'll never get me secret Krabby Patty formula, Plankton! Adios!
[Mr. Krabs kicks Plankton out and sends him flying through the air, over some of the Bikini Bottomites, and lands on the ground. Plankton's landing makes him slide face down and hits Sandy's boot.]
Sandy: Hmm? [sees Plankton near her boot] Plankton, you look like the cheese that fell off the cracker. I bet you tried to get that formula again.
Plankton: [spits out sand from his mouth] I don't get it. A crab's brain is smaller than the point of a pencil, but he keeps outsmarting me!
[Patrick rides past Sandy and Plankton with his skateboard facing upside down.]
Sandy: You should give up that formula. Mr. Krabs would have to be as dumb as Patrick.
Plankton: [thinks for a second] Yes. [gets an idea] Yes he would! As dumb as Patrick! [laughs]
[The scene changes to Plankton riding on a stream of water on a canoe. The stream turned out to be droll of Patrick who is fast asleep under his rock. Plankton canoes into Patrick's mouth. Plankton then puts his helmet on turns on the light.]
Plankton: One swab from the inside of his cheek should do it.
[Plankton takes a cotton swab and dabs on Patrick's cheek to abstract some saliva. Suddenly, a vibration shakes inside Patrick's mouth and his tongue shakes Plankton off.]
Plankton: Nagging Neptune! [Plankton whacks the tongue with his swab] Back you twisted tongue! You will not lick me!
[Patrick's tongue turns Plankton around and licks his butt. Plankton shrieks as he finds this gross. Plankton whacks the tongue again with his swab and the tongue falls. Just then, Patrick unexpectedly burps out gases.]
Plankton: Sweet gashes molasses!
[The gases sends Plankton and his canoe flying. Plankton changes the canoe into a plane and flies out of Patrick's mouth. Later, Plankton is seen at the Chum Bucket cooking some sauce on the stove. Karen comes in.]
Karen: Oh, pee-yew! What's that awful stench? You're not boiling your underpants again, are you?
[Laughter is heard.]
Plankton: I told you to turn off that laugh track. And if you must know, I made sauce. [holds out his swab with Patrick's saliva on it] But when I add Patrick's DNA to it, it'll become Salsa Imbecilicus.
[An image of Patrick forms on the saliva.]
Plankton: Idiot sauce! [laughs] I'll serve it to Krabs and it'll make him so dumb, he'll just give me the secret formula! Huh? Huh?
Karen: I think I'd prefer the boiling underpants. [turns on the laugh track] Let me do it. You always make a mess.
Plankton: Leave me be, woman!
Karen: Don't tell me... [Plankton turns her off]
[Karen angrily leaves the kitchen. Plankton laughs evilly as he dips the swab with Patrick's saliva into the sauce. However, the sauce boils a big bubble. Plankton accidentally pops the bubble with the swab and sauce gets splattered onto him.]
Plankton: Oh no.
[Plankton drops the swab into the sauce and he tries to shake the sauce off of himself. However, the sauce caused Plankton's body to become like Patrick's body and Plankton began to act dumb. Plankton plays with his lips as the steam from the sauce goes up the chimney and get absorbed into a cloud. The cloud goes over Bikini Bottom and rains the sauce over the town. Soon, everyone ended up acting as dumb as Patrick. The next day, Sandy comes out of her treedome and notices the townsfolk is acting very strangely and appeared to be dumb as Patrick. She goes to Squidward's house and sees it has a clown wig and a clown nose on it. Squidward is outside his house acting very dumb.]
Squidward: I've got the best taste in town! Duh! [runs goofily into his house]
Sandy: I never thought that folks around here were particularly bright. But this morning everyone seems as dumb as traffic cones.
[Dave runs around laughing with a cone on his head. He jumps and continues running. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob is on the ground flipping dirt with his spatula. Then he somewhat makes a patty out of the dirt.]
Sandy: What happened to your head, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh, me make Krabby Patties.
Sandy: Uh, that's mud.
[SpongeBob shoves the dirt into his holes and squeezes them out. He laughs and runs off to a crowd of people surrounding a stop sign. Patrick comes with a yellow balloon and is still riding the skateboard upside down.]
Sandy: Hey, Patrick. Have you noticed that everyone's acting a lot like you today?
[Patrick eats the balloon and it pops inside his mouth which deflates his head. Patrick lifts his head up.]
Patrick: I don't understand the question.
[Patrick leaves and continues riding the skateboard upside down. Sandy sees Mr. Krabs laughing and throwing money everywhere. Mr. Krabs pulls out the bottle containing the secret formula, opens it and eats it. He burps out the formula into dozens of pieces.]
Sandy: What in Sam Hill?
[Sandy sees Mrs. Puff being pushed on her boat upside down by Billy and pretends to drive her boat. Tom is seen wearing the shower curtain and his brushing his back with the scrub brush. Nat Peterson is seen riding his bike sideways on the round while hitting his head against a rock. The several people are chasing a jellyfish who stings them when they touch it.]
Sandy: Hey, don't do that!
[Sandy goes after them until they stopped at the end of a line at the Chum Bucket.]
Sandy: Lining up for the Chum Bucket? Now, I know everyone's got a hole in their screen door. This place is ground zero for zero.
[Sandals knocks on Sandy's helmet and puts his mouth on top.]
Sandy: [grossed out] Zero as being everyone's collective IQ.
[The scene changes to Plankton biting his antenna and rolling on the floor in the kitchen of the Chum Bucket. Sandy is seen talking to Karen as she is explaining what's going on.]
Karen: And that's how the idiot sauce spread throughout Bikini Bottom. I guess you weren't affected because you were protected by your treedome.
Sandy: And you weren't affected because you're a computer. Looks like it's up to us to find a cure for the town's idiocy.
[Plankton is banging his head against the mirror.]
Plankton: You not Plankton! Me Plankton! [bangs his head against the mirror]
Karen: We need to snap him out of this. What's the opposite of dim?
Sandy: Bright.
[Karen and Sandy turn on a lamp to try to snap Plankton out of his stupidity but nothing works.]
Karen: It's not working! Maybe we can feed him something for brain food. You're smart. What do you eat?
[Plankton gets to close to the light bulb and burns his eye.]
Sandy: Nuts?
[The scene changes to Sandy stuffing Plankton's mouth with acorns, but nothing's working.]
Sandy: Oh, it doesn't seem to be working. You know him. How do you get him to change? 
Karen: I usually just yell at him. Get smart, dummy!
Sandy: Wise up!
Karen: Be clever, idiot!
Sandy: Know things!
[Nothing is working as Plankton laughs and claps like a seal.]
Karen: [sighs] It's no use. Being smart takes work.
Sandy: [thinks a second] That gives me an idea.
[The scene changes to Sandy and Karen standing at the front doors of a school called Bikini Bottom University.]
Sandy: Come one, come all to Bikini Bottom University! A free education for all! There's no more excuse for being a dope! Step right up, all you morons! Classes are now beginning!
[But the Bikini Bottomites were so dumb, they didn't listen and continued to walk around stupidly.]
Sandy: Aww! This isn't working!
Karen: Try jiggling the keys!
[Sandy pulls the rope and jiggles the keys. The Bikini Bottomites see the keys and go in. Later, Karen and Sandy are in a classroom.]
Sandy: Good mornin', students.
[The students continue to act stupid when they are in their desks.]
Sandy: A whole school full of Patricks? Looks like we've got our work cut out for us.
[The scene changes to Sandy teaching Jimmy Gus how to put on pants. She gives him a demonstration. Jimmy chews on the pants, but realizes it's not something to eat. Jimmy puts his pants on backwards, but Sandy gives him a thumbs-up. In doing so, the point on Jimmy's head gets smaller. Karen is in the other classroom teaching the students how to eat. She demonstrates on how to eat with a spoon. Frank flips some food at Tom with the spoon and Debbie Rechid dips her head in the food. Nat Peterson seems to get it and ate the food with the spoon. The point on Nat's head gets smaller. In another classroom called Home EC, Mr. Krabs is attempting to make a Krabby Patty. He makes it, but it has the carton of milk in the middle and the patty is on top of the bun. Mr. Krabs eats the patty along with the milk carton and the plate. Karen seemed unsure if that was ok, but gives Mr. Krabs a thumbs up.]
French Narrator: One semester later...
[All of the Bikini Bottomites, who have now returned to their normal selves after a long semester, leave the classroom.]
Sandy: And don't forget your last homework assignment!
Karen: Looks like we were able to educate the whole town in one semester!
Sandy: Yep! Day after tomorrow is graduation! And everybody learned so well.
Karen: Everybody but one.
[Plankton is still acting stupid though somewhat smarter and becomes a school bully and is writing on the locker doors with a pen.]
Plankton: [laughs] Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: [reading] "Skool iz dum"? You misspelled every word.
Plankton: [angrily] Shut up, dweeb!
[Mr. Krabs freaks out and drops his books.]
Plankton: Cook books, eh? You holdin' out on me, Krabs?
[Mr. Krabs picks up his books.]
Mr. Krabs: I don't know what you're talkin' about, Plankton! Leave me alone!
[Mr. Krabs runs off crying.]
Plankton: I know you're cookin' up something special in Home EC, Eugene! I want that formula!
SpongeBob: [from inside the locker] Um, Plankton, can I come out now?
Plankton: Did you finish my homework for me, nerd?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
[SpongeBob pushes Plankton's homework out from the holes of the locker door. Plankton opens on the door and SpongeBob comes out.]
SpongeBob: You know, you really ought to do your own homework. It's the only way you'll learn.
Plankton: I'll never learn!
[Plankton notices Patrick, who is working as janitor, sweeps the skateboard across the floor and accidentally crushes the screaming Plankton.]
Plankton: Not again!
French Narrator: Ahh. Graduation Day.
[All of the Bikini Bottomites are in their cap and gown and is having a graduation ceremony for attending the university.]
Sandy: This is a proud day for everyone in Bikini Bottom! And as a treat, Squidward will play Pomp and Circumstance on the clarinet.
[Squidward begins playing Pomp and Circumstance, but ends up playing the wrong notes which aggravates the crowd. Meanwhile, in Home EC, Mr. Krabs is busy making a Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Hurry up, Mr. Krabs. They're handing out the diplomas.
Mr. Krabs: Just a minute. I think I've perfected the Krabby Patty formula! [takes a bite of the patty and it tastes good] Yes! That's it!
SpongeBob: Great! Well, see ya out there.
[SpongeBob leaves and Plankton enters the classroom.]
Plankton: Somethin' smells good!
[Mr. Krabs finishes writing the formula but when he sees Plankton, he hides it in his graduation gown.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! P...P...Plankton? What are you doin' here?
Plankton: It's the last day of school, baby. No need to be formal. Call me Sheldon. [takes a bite of the patty] Great Neptune! That's perfection! Well, with this recipe, I could own the most popular fast food restaurant in Bikini Bottom!
Mr. Krabs: [frightened] No, please! Not that! Anything but that!
Plankton: Hand over that secret formula, Krabs!
[Meanwhile at the graduation ceremony, all of the Bikini Bottomites throw their caps in the air and have become graduates of the Bikini Bottom University.]
Karen: Congratulations, SpongeBob! You're smart now! It's funny that Mr. Krabs never showed up to get his diploma.
SpongeBob: Yeah. The only two people who didn't show up are Mr. Krabs and Plankton. [gasps] Let me have that diploma!
[SpongeBob grabs the diploma, takes of his cap and gown and runs across the hallway.]
Patrick: Uh, hey. No running in the halls!
[SpongeBob runs slowly. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is cornered by Plankton and he reluctantly gives the formula to him.]
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Plankton.
[All of a sudden, SpongeBob bursts in the classroom.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, your diploma!
[SpongeBob throws the diploma and Mr. Krabs catches it, preventing him from giving the formula to Plankton.]
Mr. Krabs: Thanks to this here diploma, I'm suddenly smart enough to never give you me secret formula!
Plankton: What?! If I knew education worked like that, I would have bought a diploma years ago!
Mr. Krabs: Of course it doesn't work like that, you microscopic meathead! I took  accelerated classes and graduated months ago! This diploma is just a formality!
Plankton: But... but you were just about to give me the formula! Y..You were scared of me!
[Sandy turns on a light from behind the chalkboard.]
Sandy: Excellent, Mr. Krabs! [writes a grade for Mr. Krabs] Here's your final grade for acting class. A+. [gives Mr. Krabs his grade] I've really felt the fear.
Plankton: Wait, what?! Acting class?! [Mr. Krabs picks up Plankton] No!
Mr. Krabs: You've finally been schooled, drop-out!
[Mr. Krabs stuffs Plankton in his diploma and blows him out the window. Plankton was sent flying onto Karen's computer screen where she turns on the laugh track.]
Karen: Come on, evil genius. Time to start your post-college years.
[The episode ends with Plankton groaning in defeat as Karen carries him away.]


SpongeBob: [knocks on Patrick's rock] Get up, Patrick! It's time! [rock opens up]
Patrick: [barely waking up] Time for what?
SpongeBob: The big shin-dig! Remember?
Patrick: No, besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. They're a bit flabby today. [wiggles his foot]
SpongeBob: That's shin dig, buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship.
Patrick: The beach! Just you and me!? [SpongeBob rips off his pants showing his swim trunks; Patrick rips off his skin showing his insides] So am I ready for the beach, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uhhh... Sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine! [bubble transition to a bus coming by. SpongeBob and Patrick shove a huge bag of stuff onto it] I'm spending the whole day at the beach with my best friend. [shoves his bag onto a seat with someone sitting in the seat. SpongeBob and Patrick both cram themselves on the same seat along with the guy]
Guy on Bus: You're hurting me!
SpongeBob: [taps the guy in front of him on the shoulder (Harold)] Guess what?
Person in front of him (Harold): [sigh] What?
SpongeBob: I'm going to the beach with my best friend! [taps the bus driver's shoulder] Ooohhhh buuusss drrrivvver!
Bus driver:  What?
SpongeBob: Okay, out of everybody on this bus, guess which one is my best friend?
Bus driver: I don't care.
SpongeBob: You know what this situation calls for. Patrick! [SpongeBob takes out a keyboard guitar, and Patrick takes out an accordion] A few verses of the best friend tune! [SpongeBob and Patrick start playing and singing]♪Ohhhh best fr-♪ [the bus stops and SpongeBob and Patrick are kicked off it] Hey! Wait! This is not our stop! Oh, how are we going to get to the beach now, Patrick? We don't even know where we are.
Patrick: I knew it! We've been abandoned!
SpongeBob: No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here! [Patrick sobbing]
Volleyball player: [hits SpongeBob in the head with a volleyball] A little help, bro?
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! We made it! Hey best friend? Check this out! [turns around and his pants appear to be sagging. Reaches in his pants and takes out a Frisbee] It's a small plastic disc that you throw!
Patrick: Small plastic disc that you throw! [claps] I love to play... small plastic disc that you throw!
SpongeBob: I do, too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name.
Patrick: Ohhh...hmmm... How about small plastic disc that you toss!?
SpongeBob: Perfect! Now run along, Patrick, and I'll [winks] toss it to you!
Patrick: [runs] Ha ha ha ha.
SpongeBob: Ready?! [throws Frisbee. Patrick is running and laughing. He steps on two people and kicks sand in a guy's sandwich]
Nat: Ha ha ha! That's why they call it a sandwich! [Patrick kicks sand in his mouth while trying to catch the Frisbee. He almost runs into a pane of glass being carried by two workers. He crashes through an ice cream cart, and then into a lifeguard tower]
Patrick: [Underneath rubble of the life guard tower, Frisbee lands in his hand] I caught it! [Pants] Wasn't that cool, SpongeBob?
Life Guard: [pops out from underneath the tower rubble] I can assure you, that was not cool! Just look at what you've done! Your buffoonery has destroyed the lifeguard tower! Why don't you find something to do that's less obnoxious?
Patrick: Like what?
Life Guard: I don't know, go play in the sand or something!
Patrick: Well, I don't know. Playing with the sand sounds pretty boring.
SpongeBob: Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or...
Patrick: Boring, SpongeBob, boring!
SpongeBob: I know, we can make sand castles!
Patrick: That sounds [elbows SpongeBob] un-boring!"
SpongeBob: No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle. [Laughs. Bubble transition to him constructing a sand castle. SpongeBob talks to the man he has drawn in a window of his castle] Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy? [To Patrick] How ya doing over there?
Patrick: [patting sand] Everything's dandy in Patrick's Kingdom.
SpongeBob: Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over. [begins rubbing down Patrick's sand mound]
Patrick: Whoa! What are you doing!? You destroyed my castle!
SpongeBob: I'm just trying to help, buddy!
Patrick: Well, I don't need any help.
Patrick's Architect: Here are those architectural plans you requested.
Patrick: Why thank you. Here's a little something for you." [hands architect sand money which promptly disintegrates in his hands]
SpongeBob: Well, I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm. [to the little man in his sand castle] And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side.
Patrick: [throws a ball of sand at SpongeBob's castle, destroying it] Now, we're even!
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick, have it your way. [Draws a line in the sand separating the two of them] "You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine. [mumbles to himself and quickly builds an even larger and better castle]
Patrick: ['looks at his plans] Now, this'll show SpongeBob that he's not the only one who can build a castle! Let's see SpongeBob destroy this castle! [builds a castle with spikes on top and a skull and crossbones symbol on the door]
SpongeBob: [After seeing Patrick's new castle] I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas. [starts building a wall, but then notices that Patrick's castle is over the borderline] Oh, sir, you built onto my side.
Patrick: So?
SpongeBob: [mad] So, you don't do that! [karate chops off the portion of Patrick's castle that is crossing] There! That restores the integrity of our shared border.
Patrick: You tyrant! You've done it again! I'll show you what for! [Builds a hammer out of sand and charges toward SpongeBob's castle]
SpongeBob: But what for what!?
Patrick: [attacks SpongeBob's castle, completely destroying it] Now, we're even... again!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again. [builds this huge castle and Patrick does the same. Bubble transition to SpongeBob blowing a medieval horn] I hereby propose a non-aggression treaty to end hostilities between our two kingdoms. [Patrick signs SpongeBob's sand made treaty] Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!" [Patrick shoots a sand arrow at SpongeBob's castle] What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?
Patrick: This treaty isn't worth the sand it's printed on! [Treaty disintegrates]
SpongeBob: Oh, is that so!?" Well, if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is bring it on! [Patrick laughs and builds an army of knights. SpongeBob clears his throat] Patrick, I'm trying to be the nice guy here, okay? Let's call this silly business off.
Patrick: No way! You started it.
SpongeBob: Fine! Have it your way.
Patrick: [laughs menacingly] Whatever. [SpongeBob is loading a catapult] No no no no no. [SpongeBob chops the catapult rope. Patrick screams as the sand rocks from SpongeBob's catapult hurl toward him destroying Patrick's army. SpongeBob laughs and blows another horn. SpongeBob's army emerges from his castle and charges toward Patrick. Patrick screams again. SpongeBob's army starts to ram down the door to Patrick's castle. Patrick panics and builds a cannon. SpongeBob's army breaks the door] Oh hello! And goodbye. [pulls cannon's string. SpongeBob's army rushes in his castle away from the cannonball]
SpongeBob: Come on! [closes the door to his castle] How do you like them apples? [Cannonball goes over the wall and destroys the army]
Patrick: [laughs from atop his castle] You'll never win! Do you hear me!?
SpongeBob: [now inside a high tech sand castle] Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put, general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you? [Sand constructed general starts to fall apart] Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately! [builds a tank that then crashes through his own castle and towards Patrick's] How do you like me now?
Patrick: [has a robot already built that punches through his own castle] I like you this much! [picks up SpongeBob's tank with SpongeBob screaming inside] Feel me!
SpongeBob: [screams again. He presses a button in his tank blowing up Patrick's robot. He emerges from his tank and sees Patrick inside his robot head] Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?
Patrick: [quietly] The question is... will you be!? [presses a button in his robot head. The robot flies into the air with SpongeBob still hanging on. SpongeBob looks down and sees how high up he is. He then slips and falls through the sky. Then he pulls a sand parachute and laughs] No fair!
SpongeBob: [Floating gently down] All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!? [presses a sand button. Falls into his jet waiting in midair. SpongeBob presses a button in his jet while chasing Patrick's robot head] Now let's have some real fun! [Missiles fly toward Patrick. Patrick screams as he turns his robot away from the missiles]
Beach Onlooker: [to the person next to him] What was that!? Come on, we got to get out of here! [More people on the beach scream and run away]
Patrick: [calm now] Oh, yeah? Two can play at this game! [Presses button. Patriot missiles emerge from the ground and fly toward SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [seeing the missiles] Jumping jellyfish! WHOA! [Turns the plane down, does a loop, and crashes the missiles into Patrick's castle. SpongeBob laughs. Patrick's robot meets SpongeBob's in the air]
Patrick: I wasn't going to do this, but you've left me no choice. [Patrick drops an atomic bomb on SpongeBob's castle]
Gryphon: [gasps] Let's beat it, dude! [He and another griffin fly away as the bomb explodes. Patrick laughs menacingly. Patrick is interrupted by SpongeBob flying his jet directly toward Patrick. Patrick screams loudly. SpongeBob's jet crashes into Patrick's robot]
SpongeBob: [laying on the ground in pain] Ohhhh.
Patrick: [also laying on the ground in pain] Ohhhh. What happened?
SpongeBob: I'll tell you what happened, Patrick... I got carried away.
Patrick: Me, too...was it worth it?
SpongeBob: No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson. [SpongeBob and Patrick hug]
Lifeguard: Let's also not forget who's going to clean this place up. [camera pans around showing the destruction caused]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Oooh, uhhhh, ahhhh...
Lifeguard: [gives Patrick a dustpan and hands SpongeBob a broom] Better get started! You've got a lot of work to do.
Patrick: I bet I can clean up faster than you!
SpongeBob: Oh yeah? I bet you can't!
Patrick: Yes, I can!
SpongeBob: No, I can!
Patrick: Oh, I can!
SpongeBob: I can!
Patrick: Hey, look at this!


SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy! [While knocking on her door, a spaceship comes up from underneath the ground at the left side of the tree dome] Wow! [Sandy peeks her head out of a spaceship window]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around.
SpongeBob: [Sandy rides an elevator on the bottom floor and meets SpongeBob downstairs] Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
Sandy: [pointing to a poster of the moon] I'm goin' to the moon, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: The moon! Can I go?
Sandy: No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird. [shown a graveyard of dead animals] Besides, there's not enough room for you.
SpongeBob: But I don't take up that much space! [squishes himself into a little square] See? [downsizes himself to fit into a little drawer] I can fit in here. [closes the drawer] Mmm, cozy.
Sandy: I need that drawer.
SpongeBob: Well, how about... [jumps into a test tube] This? [jumps into another test tube] Or this? [jumps into another test tube] Or this?
Sandy: SpongeBob, this isn't for fun. [shows her clipboard with math equations on it] See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways. [SpongeBob is behind a set of bars]
SpongeBob: Fine. [deep voice] Put me in the brig, I don't mind!
Sandy: That's the air vent, SpongeBob. [pushes a button to turn the air vent on that blows SpongeBob out of it] I need that, too.
SpongeBob: Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
Sandy: All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...
SpongeBob: [running around the ship] YEAH!!! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride, moon ride, moon ride!
Sandy: [grabs SpongeBob] But this time, just don't touch anything, okay? [Cuts to Sandy pumping a gun and SpongeBob comes to watch her]
SpongeBob: Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
Sandy: Aww, hush, silly. [shoots her gun and 3 gray nets cover a couple items] This is for harvesting moon rocks.
SpongeBob: Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
Sandy: Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores? [walks around and forms a circle around him and Sandy with his shoes] And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night? [sees a circle] Ah! There's one now!
Sandy: SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave your crazy alien notions behind.
SpongeBob: [trying to sleep. Checks the clock every few seconds] Oh, hurry up! [grabs two clothes pins and puts them on his eyelids] These oughta do the trick.
Patrick: [Sitting in the window] Hi ya, SpongeBob! [clothes pins shoot off his eyes]
SpongeBob: What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?
Patrick: Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.
SpongeBob: A present?
Patrick: No. Uh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?
SpongeBob: There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
Patrick: [shows a spray can] Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!
SpongeBob: Alien repellent? Let me see that. [looks at the can] New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the rocket]
Patrick: Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: It's pretty impressive, all right.
Patrick: Come on! [both head for the rocket]
SpongeBob: We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
Patrick: Wow. How do you think we get inside? [pulls a level that says "open"]
SpongeBob: We don't, we're just spraying the... [door opens on SpongeBob] ...windows.
Patrick: I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on! [both walk inside] Holy sea cow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
SpongeBob: Yeah, just don't touch anything. [Patrick starts playing with everything]
Patrick: Look, I'm winning!
SpongeBob: Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun... [SpongeBob turns around and looks at himself as thin in the mirror] ...house?
Patrick: WOO-HOO! WINNER! YEAH! HIGH SCORE!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
Patrick: I don't know! [notices a lever above his head] But let's see what this does!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think we should... [Patrick pulls a lever and the two launch off the seat out of the rocket]
Patrick: I like rockets. [both fall back into the rocket]
Patrick: More! More!
SpongeBob: No more! [Patrick presses a button and both shake a lot then stop] Okay, one more. [shake again] Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
Patrick: Hey, I think this one starts it! [SpongeBob stops Patrick from pushing a button]
SpongeBob: Stop, Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here. And I happen to know that that particular button is riiight over here. [presses the engine button and the ship starts up and is blasting off]
Patrick: You started the rocket!
Sandy: [wakes up and notices the smoke] ...Awwwww, Spongebob... [SpongeBob and Patrick hold onto each other while the ship is taking off]
Patrick: Hold on, buddy! [while screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick are falling down to the bottom of the ship. The ship enters space and both of them start to float] Hey, we stopped falling!
SpongeBob: Look! [points at the dark galaxy] We're in space now! Wee! [both float around in the ship]
Patrick: Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something! [SpongeBob laughs as the ship is going around the moon] Hey, SpongeBob, watch this! [squirts toothpaste into some peanut butter]
SpongeBob: Hey, you got your toothpaste in my peanut butter! [SpongeBob lifts a heavy weight on one finger] Patrick, I can do this! [the ship is landing back into the sea and the heavy weight hurls into the ground and flattens SpongeBob's hand]
Patrick: Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
SpongeBob: We must be landing.
Patrick: All right! [Sandy uses her jetpack to fly up to the moon]
Sandy: Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts. [the ship is now in Bikini Bottom. While Sandy searches for SpongeBob and Patrick on the moon, these two get out of the ship]
Patrick: Wow, it sure looks a lot like home. [Patrick sees Gary asleep] Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
SpongeBob: Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
Patrick: So you mean to say they’ve taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we’ve been thinking our thoughts we think we thought?! I think?
SpongeBob: Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it! [SpongeBob captures Gary with a gray net-like substance] Yeah!
Patrick: You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.
SpongeBob: Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me! [grabs Gary] Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier! [tosses Gary into the ship. Ship's number increases from 00 to 01; ding from "The Price Is Right"]
Patrick: Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
SpongeBob: Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them. "Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to!" [whispering to Patrick] Make sure your gun is pumped. [go in and see Squidward sleeping] Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting. [Squidward moves his arms and legs around then puts them back down. He mutters incomprehensibly and says, "Grandma"] It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis. [SpongeBob takes the covers off. Squidward is wearing a pink floral top]
Patrick: Wait! What's THAT? [SpongeBob takes a red bag out from underneath Squidward. It appears to be a hot water bottle] I think I'm gonna be sick.
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
Patrick: Stinky.
SpongeBob: No. It's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo. [Patrick puts flashlight under the so-called "egg sack" and SpongeBob's hands are under it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Twins! [Squidward rolls over in his sleep and his right tentacle sticks on Patrick's helmet]
Patrick: Pardon my French, but get this thing off me! [SpongeBob and Patrick try to get his tentacles off but they wake him up instead]
Squidward: Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
Patrick: It's awake!
SpongeBob: Let's capture the little phony! [Squidward screams]
Squidward: Get away from me! [runs away while SpongeBob and Patrick try to capture him. Outside, Mr. Krabs walks up with his pet worm and notices Squidward's house shaking. SpongeBob and Patrick come out with Squidward captured]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye? [laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick point their guns at his head] Wait! Don't shoot! Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!
SpongeBob: We don't want your money... moon man! [both capture Mr. Krabs and toss him and Squidward into the ship] Look at them squirming around in there.
Patrick: Eww, gross.
SpongeBob: Well, there's plenty more where those came from. [at Boating School]
Mrs. Puff: [grading some of her students' paper] SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late? [captured] Whatever this is... [inflates herself and has a deep voice] ...it's going on your permanent record! [Flats, Shubie, and Larry are captured along with all of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick are run out of room in the ship for everyone]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.
SpongeBob: There's no time for that! Just push harder. [Sandy is on her jetpack floating down]
Sandy: SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of... [SpongeBob and Patrick capture her]
SpongeBob: Nice try, Sandy.
Patrick: Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. Hahaha!
Sandy: Aliens? Is that what this is about? [SpongeBob and Patrick throw her into the ship] This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot-- [door is slammed shut]
SpongeBob: It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone. [both stare at each other and pump their guns] So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!
Patrick: I didn't even know!
SpongeBob: Yeah? Well, I got you now.
Patrick: Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's... [Patrick catches himself with the gray netting as it turns out he had his gun pointed the wrong way] ...me that's got me!
SpongeBob: Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face! [ship runs out of gas and stops on the moon] Sandy, I'm back! [peeks out the window] Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different. [sees the Earth and realizes his mistake] Uh-oh...
Everyone else: SpongeBob, we "aliens" would like a word with you!


[The episode begins at Squidward's house. Squidward is dancing along with the music from "The Nutcracker Suite." Squidward continues to dance and show off some of his moves. Just then, SpongeBob appears and joins in the dancing as well.]
SpongeBob: [whispering] You dance divinely.
[Squidward freaks out and clings himself to the ceiling with his suction cups. He loses his grip and falls to the floor. Patrick appears, removes the record from the phonograph, and places a different record on it. The record begins playing funky, rock music.]
Patrick: Shall we?
SpongeBob: Oh, I love this song!
[Patrick and SpongeBob dance to the rock music. Squidward gets really angry and removes the record from the phonograph.]
Squidward: Why are you nitwits in my house?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're bored!
Patrick: And we don't want to be bored!
SpongeBob: We wanna have fun.
[Patrick kicks the pillar holding Squidward's head sculpture. Squidward screams and catches the sculpture before it hits the floor. Squidward sighs in relief and his head shatters. SpongeBob is standing upside down and Patrick eats his pants.]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward. Give us something fun to do. Please?
[Squidward groans and Patrick's stomach grumbles.]
Patrick: Oh, let's play lunch!
SpongeBob: No problem. I'll whip up some grub.
[SpongeBob and Patrick run over to the kitchen and begin taking stuff out of Squidward's fridge and cabinets.]
Squidward: Leave my kitchen alone!
SpongeBob: Hm, there must be something I can scavenge up around here.
Squidward: [grins evilly and gets an idea] Oh! That's it. How would you two like to go on a... scavenger hunt?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Scavenger hunt?
Patrick: What's a scavenger hunt?
[SpongeBob takes out a dictionary from his head, turns the pages with his nose, and looks up the word, "Scavenger Hunt."]
SpongeBob: [reading] "A party game in which participants work in teams to collect a list of miscellaneous objects!" Scavenger hunt, yeah! What's first on the list, Squidward?
Squidward: Um, oh, uh, well, let's see. [takes out a roll of toilet paper and pretends to read something on it] Bring back the rare Desert Sandwich.
[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle and began searching all over the place to look for Squidward's "Desert Sandwich." SpongeBob looks for it in the phonograph.]
SpongeBob: Sandwich?
[Patrick looks for it under Squidward's picture.]
SpongeBob: [looks for it in Squidward's nose, which causes him to scream] Sandwich? Sandwich? [lets go of Squidward's nose]
Squidward: [straightens out his nose] Not in here! The sandwich is only found deep in the Bikini Badlands, out there!
Patrick: [he and SpongeBob stop looking] Oh.
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out and shuts the door] Phew. I am a genius.
[SpongeBob and Patrick stop at a sign pointing to the Goodlands and to the Badlands.]
SpongeBob: Goodlands, half a league.
[SpongeBob and Patrick observe the Goodlands. There, they see jellyfish swimming around, flowers and trees dancing, sun and rainbow shining down and a sea unicorn skipping along.]
SpongeBob: Badlands, 20,000 leagues?
[SpongeBob and Patrick observe the Badlands. There, they see a dried-up wasteland with a volcano, a cactus, and a skeleton with sea urchins crawling out. SpongeBob and Patrick are stunned, but they decide to go there anyway. The scene changes to them traveling the Badlands. They become exhausted from the high temperatures and are very thirsty since they had no drinking water with them. SpongeBob and Patrick collapsed from exhaustion.]
Patrick: So...thirsty. [rings SpongeBob's sweat and drinks it for water] Oh.
SpongeBob: [dried up and very weak] It's no use. We'll never find the rare Desert Sandwich.
[Suddenly, a sand tornado appears out of nowhere. SpongeBob and Patrick scream in terror and sand gets into their eyes. The sand tornado lifts them in the air and starts to carry them away. Meanwhile, back at Squidward's house, Squidward is in his bathrobe, dancing with "The Nutcracker Suite" again. The door opens and Squidward flies backward. SpongeBob and Patrick arrive.]
SpongeBob: Squidward! We did it! We brought back the first item!
[A sand tornado comes through the door and into the living room.]
Squidward: Sand? [sand is blown in Squidward's face]
[The sand tornado dies down, revealing a witch within it. The witch cackles.]
Squidward: [spits out the sand] Witch? [the witch cackles] Oh, good grief! Not that kind of sand witch! The Desert Sandwich has tomatoes and bread and—and—mayo.
Sand Witch: No worries, I used to work at an evil deli. [creates a sandwich with her magic] Ta-da!
Squidward: Oh, looks pretty good. [takes a bite and spikes poke out from his cheeks; he screams as the sandwich comes to life and bites his nose] Get it off! Get it off! [gets mauled by the sandwich monster]
[The sand witch cackles. The scene changes to the sandwich monster being locked in the refrigerator.]
SpongeBob: What's next on our scavenger hunt, Squidward?
Squidward: Hmm...oh. [sees a picture of a flower] Mm-hmm. Your next item is the Boxing Begonia! [spins the globes and points to the location] It only grows in the deepest canyon of the Mariana Trench.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh! [giggle as they run out the door]
Squidward: Ha. That'll keep them out of my hair. [rubs his head and it glimmers since he has no hair] Oh.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick looking down at the deepest canyon of the Mariana Trench.]
Patrick: It's so straight-downy.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. A scavenger is always prepared. [pulls out a rope, ties it to a nearby rock and goes to climb down, but the rope isn't long enough] The rope is too short! We need another one!
Patrick: [throws down a rope] Here!
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick! Where'd you get another rope?
Patrick: From that rock!
[Patrick slips off the edge and falls down into the canyon with SpongeBob, crashing into some stalagmites in the process. They both crash to the ground below the canyon.]
SpongeBob: Found it!
[The scene changes back to Squidward's house where Squidward resumes his dancing. SpongeBob and Patrick swing into his house through the window with the Boxing Begonia they found.]
SpongeBob: We're back!
Squidward: What? But—but it's not possible! [becomes amazed at the Boxing Begonia's beauty] Boxing Begonia? It's beautiful.
[The Boxing Begonia comes to life and starts beating up Squidward with boxing gloves.]
Patrick: The champ takes a swift uppercut to the jaw. [punches himself]
SpongeBob: Squidward is against the ropes. A left, a right.
Patrick: How can a man stand it?
[Squidward falls flat on the floor, knocking out his dentures.]
SpongeBob: Oh, and the champ is down!
Patrick: [holding up the Boxing Begonia] The winner!
[The scene changes to a beaten-up Squidward pacing back and forth.]
Squidward: How do you keep finding everything?
SpongeBob: [meditating] You have to keep your skull... numb.
Patrick: Yeah, we're numb skulls!
Squidward: [sighs and takes out a book] Your next mission is to find [points to the picture of the Loch Ness Monster] the Loch Ness Monster and bring him back...alive.
SpongeBob: Ooh, the Loch Ness Monster!
Patrick: Oh, so good! Oh, so good! [takes out a notebook and a pencil; he sharpens his pencil with his bellybutton] What color?
Squidward: [pushes the sofa] Doesn't matter! Good luck! [throws them out and grins evilly] They'll never find it. And if they do, it'll eat them. [laughs] It's a win-win. [yelps as the sofa falls on top of him]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick rowing their boat upside-down in the rivers of Scotland.]
SpongeBob: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
Patrick: How are we gonna find a monster in the dark? I can't see anything.
SpongeBob: We don't have to find it. It'll find us. [pulls out some bagpipes and plays music with it]
[As SpongeBob plays music with his bagpipes, a shadowy creature swims around and looms over them. SpongeBob and Patrick wail in fright. Meanwhile, back at Squidward's house, Squidward resumes his dancing and is playing with his clarinet while wearing a beautiful, purple hat and a scarf.]
Squidward: [sighs] I'm the greatest. [hears a knock at the door] And here comes the worst. [takes off his hat]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [enters] We're back!
[The Loch Ness Monster smashes through the wall above the front door with his head.]
Squidward: [shuddering] The lo—lo— The Loch Ness Monster! How did you find it?
SpongeBob: Oh, simple. [takes out his bagpipe] Bagpipes.
Squidward: [grabs the bagpipe] It likes bagpipe music? [the bagpipes blow air out]
Patrick: No, it hates it.
[The Loch Ness Monster roars, grabs Squidward with his mouth, and swallows him whole with the bagpipes.]
The Loch Ness Monster: Ahh...
SpongeBob: But it sure loves to eat 'em!
French Narrator: One very long digestive tract later...
[Squidward is completely worn out from nearly being digested from the Loch Ness Monster. SpongeBob and Patrick bounce on the sofa while Squidward sits in agony.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Give us another one! Give us another one! Give us another one!
Squidward: Oh, brother! [grins evilly and comes up with another idea] Brother...
SpongeBob: Come on, just one more.
Squidward: [pretends to act nervous] Well, all right, it's—it's impossible, but... [sniffles as he pretends to cry] if only you could find my long lost brother.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hold Squidward's hands] Brother?
Squidward: [chuckles wickedly as he grabs his picture and draws a mustache on it; he turns around and pretends to be heartbroken] I haven't seen him since he was a baby.
SpongeBob: Aww.
Patrick: Baby with a mustache.
Squidward: [rubs his head] He was an early bloomer.
SpongeBob: What was his name?
Squidward: Name, huh? Um...
SpongeBob: "Um?" Aw, what a pretty name.
Squidward: [pretends to be heartbroken] If I could just see him again... [pretends to cry] No.
[SpongeBob and Patrick fall for Squidward's cruel lies and they sob hysterically.]
SpongeBob: [hugs Patrick] That's so sad!
Patrick: Even my armpits are crying! [his armpits shed tears and he blows his nose]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, we've got some extreme scavenging to do!
Patrick: Yeah!
Squidward: [carries them out the door] Oh, thank you. [throws them down and slams the door] I'm free! [laughs]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick finding Squidward's "brother" in the streets of Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: Squidward's brother!
[SpongeBob looks for Squidward's "brother" in Jellyfish Fields.]
SpongeBob: [climbs up a tree with Patrick] Squidward's brother! [peeks into a jellyfish hive] Squidward's brother? [he and Patrick get stung by jellyfish]
[SpongeBob and Patrick pop out of an old lady's bathtub when an old lady was taking a bath.]
Patrick: Squidward's brother? [he and SpongeBob get whacked in the heads by the old lady]
[SpongeBob and Patrick go to look for Squidward's "brother" at Squidward's house. SpongeBob knocks on the door and Squidward answers it.]
SpongeBob: [gasps with Patrick] He's right here! Squidward's brother!
Patrick: The rascal shaved his mustache!
Squidward: [sighs] Good grief. [slams the door on SpongeBob and Patrick]
French Narrator: Six months later...
[SpongeBob and Patrick are completely tired and their voices have grown weak from looking for Squidward's "brother."]
SpongeBob: [weakly] Um! Squidward's brother!
Patrick: [weakly] Squidward's brother!
[SpongeBob and Patrick bump into a mailbox and it reads "Mrs. Tentacles" on it.]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Tentacles? [run up to Mrs. Tentacles' house and knocks on the door with his nose; Mrs. Tentacles answers] Mrs. Tentacles, you're Squidward's mother. You must know where Squidward's brother is.
Mrs. Tentacles: Brother? Squidward never had a brother. One of him was enough. [shuts the door]
SpongeBob: Aw, that's so sad. Squidward wanted a baby brother so badly he imagined one.
Patrick: Oh, man. Now it'll take even longer to find him.
SpongeBob: Hm? [a raincloud forms above his head] Oh, I'm getting a brainstorm!
Patrick: I've got you, buddy. [takes out an umbrella and puts it over SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, let it flow. [his body absorbs the raindrops from his raincloud] Ooh, I have a plan.
[The scene changes to Squidward playing his song "I Hate People" on his clarinet while dancing around and destroying everything inside SpongeBob's house. He enters SpongeBob's room and spins Gary around.]
Gary: [groans as he is annoyed with Squidward; he goes into his shell and puts earmuffs on] Meow!
[Squidward jumps outside and hops on top of Patrick's rock. It is revealed that while SpongeBob and Patrick had been gone for six months, he attached their houses onto his own house and made it into his own playground. He slides back into his house through the window and finishes his song.]
Squidward: Oh, I love my two new homes. And best of all, I haven't heard from those idiots in months! [laughs until SpongeBob and Patrick squish him with the front door as they enter]
SpongeBob: Squidward. We found your brother.
Squidward: [pulls himself off to the door and cruelly laughs at them] You urchin brains! I never had a brother!
SpongeBob: You do now!
Patrick: Two brothers! Us!
Squidward: What are you morons talking about?
SpongeBob: [takes Mrs. Tentacles by the hand and leads her in] Come on in, Mama.
Squidward: [stammering as he is shocked to see his mother] Ma—Ma—Mama?
Mrs. Tentacles: Isn't it lovely, dear? I've adopted your two little friends.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hold up their adoption papers] Brothers.
[Squidward begins to lose his sanity as he panics like crazy. He rubs his head until it explodes. The scene changes to a cameraman preparing to take a picture of Mrs. Tentacles, Squidward, SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Camera Man: Oh, what a beautiful family—yeee. Smile!
[Mrs. Tentacles, SpongeBob, and Patrick smile for the camera while Squidward groans in defeat. The camera snaps a picture of the "family", thus ending the episode.]


[The episode starts inside the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is counting money at the register until he feels a rumble coming from outside.]
Mr. Krabs: Here they come, lads!
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Squidward: Fantastic. [crowd comes rushing in running over Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you very much, madam. [Mr. Krabs pushes the key to open the cash register over and over] I feel so alive! ♪Cha ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaree. Money, oh money, how I love thee. Cha-ching. Cha-chong. Cha-changaroo. From pennies to dollars. Any amount will do. Cha-ching. Cha-ching. It's no contest. There's only one thing that I love the best from every sight I ever seen, to sweetest sound I've heard. I'd gladly give up everything for all the money that I've earned! Cha-ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed!♪
Squidward: Please don't do that again.
Howard: [walks in the Krusty Krab] I think the stain glass barstool can go over here. And the suede hand carved wooden sports flag display case can go over there.
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there, matey. Can I help you gentlemen with something?
Howard: I'd like to speak to the owner.
Mr. Krabs: Who wants to know?
Howard: Allow me to introduce myself. Howard Blandy: President of the Blandy Franchising Company.
Mr. Krabs: Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy? [gets on his knees] I worship you. [cries]
Howard: Get it together, little man.
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, it's just you're rich. [laughs] I'm Mr. Krabs. To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?
Howard: [slaps Mr. Krabs’ claw] What would it take to buy the Krusty Krab from you?
Mr. Krabs: Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon... [suitcase full of money is shown to Mr. Krabs] Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think, Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me.
Howard: Oh, there's a lot more than that. The rest is over there. [points to a boat full of suitcases with money]
Mr. Krabs: Jumpin' King Neptune! [gulps] Sold. Can I have my money?
Howard: Just one thing. If you can sign this contract. It just states that you relinquish the Krusty Krab and all proprietary ownership thereof. Along with its employees, merchandise, logos, and cash registers.
Mr. Krabs: Do I still get the money?
Howard: Of course.
Mr. Krabs: That'll be fine then. [signs contract] Here you go. Now gimme gimme gimme gimme. [holds suitcase up in the air] Whoo-ha! See ya around. [walks out of the Krusty Krab. Contractors &amp; painters come in remodeling]
SpongeBob: What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on?
Mr. Krabs: I'm retiring!
SpongeBob: Retiring?
Mr. Krabs: I'm free to do whatever I want. I can learn to ride that bicycle I got 30 years ago. Or go to the new hook museum downtown. Or even paint bowls of fruit. Aren't you happy for me?
SpongeBob: I sure am.
Mr. Krabs: So long, boys.
SpongeBob: Have fun, Mr. Krabs. [cries]
Squidward: Heaven knows I won't.
Carl: Hi, gentlemen, I'm Carl. I'll be your new manager.
SpongeBob: New manager?
Carl: I think you'll find working at the Krabby O'Monday’s to be a both learning experience and enjoyable one.
SpongeBob: Krabby O'Monday’s?
Carl: [takes away their Krusty Krew hats] You won't be needing these anymore. [hands them new clothes] Now here are your new uniforms and here are the... [hands them heavy books] employee manuals. See ya first thing tomorrow.
Mr. Krabs: [driving boat and smelling the air] Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop: the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll... [sees the Krabby O'Monday’s] Hey, the Krabby O'Monday’s? Not the name I would've chosen, but that's all behind me now. [later, Mr. Krabs is at the Hook Museum listening to the story narrator about a 3 prong hook. Then he is at his home painting a bowl of fruit, which he actually paints a bowl of Krabby Patties. Then he is playing golf] Wait a minute. I hate golf! [now laying in his bed at home, sucking drool back into his mouth] Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon.
Pearl: [on phone] Did you see the shoes she has on? So last year. [laughs. Notices her father in the doorway] Hold on, Gina. Yeah, Dad?
Mr. Krabs: How's it going?
Pearl: Fine.
Mr. Krabs: Whatcha up to?
Pearl: I'm talking on the phone! 
Mr. Krabs: Oh, really?
Pearl: Really.
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
Pearl: Dad, isn't there something you need to do?
Mr. Krabs: Actually, I was hoping you and I could do something together.
Pearl: [pushes him out] Get out! That's it, Dad. Get a job, get a hobby, or get some friends. Because I can't take it anymore! [slams the door offscreen]
Mr. Krabs: [using metal detector on the beach] Get some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says... [runs into a window with a 'Help Wanted' sign] Help wanted. [walks into the Krabby O'Monday’s]
Squidward: Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O'Monday’s.
Tyler: It's my birthday.
Squidward: Can I start you off with...
Mother: Will you sing the Krabby O'Monday’s birthday song to my special little man?
Squidward: Happy, happy birthday. [sighs, as the family frowns in disgust] Happy, happy bir...
Carl: Uhh, Squidward, can I talk to you for a second? What's our motto here at Krabby O'Monday’s?
Squidward: Sincere service with a smile?
Carl: Well, yes, but with the Krabby O'Monday’s spirit. Now, Squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources... [A big strong guy slowly steps out of the Human Resources doorway, punching his fist in his open hand, menacingly] ...would you? So, what's our motto again?
Squidward: Sincere service [slaps self; forcefully smiling] with a smile. [he draws his eyes back to the big strong guy who slowly goes back into the room]
Carl: Now you're gettin' it.
Mr. Krabs: [in kitchen cleaning dishes] Morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy. [whistles as he sees SpongeBob with a big smile] Uhh, okay, son. You're starting to creep my out.
SpongeBob: [clings to Mr. Krabs] I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, back to work.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not your boss anymore. Just call me Eugene.
SpongeBob: Aye aye... Eugene. [giggles, while Mr. Krabs makes a weird look]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, Squidward.
Squidward: Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you so happy.
Squidward: [looks at Carl with his teeth grinned] They're watching us.
Mr. Krabs: That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy? [laughs, as Carl looks suspicious]
Squidward: Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules.
Squidward: I really think you should look. [pointing to a message]
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Help me?
Carl: Hey fellas, [Squidward quickly slams the book closed] what's going on over here?
Squidward: Oh, hey, Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene of article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook.
Carl: Cut the chatter, and pick up a platter. [slaps him] Good job, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: What have you done to the real Squidward?
Carl: The less you know, Eugene, the better. [closes the door]
Mr. Krabs: What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob? [in the kitchen, Krabby Patties are being made in a different way through an oven and spray painted to make it look like a real Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [takes a Krabby Patty from the basket] Where's the love?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!
Mr. Krabs: This is obscene. [walks out of the kitchen] Carl, I need to have a word with...
Cash Register: Your change is $1.75.
Mr. Krabs: Automated cash register? Noo! [eyes roll back in his head] Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?
Carl: Look around you. Our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre. [customer falls asleep, snoring]
Mr. Krabs: That's because they don't know what they're eating. [grabs a pile of the gray sludge from the Krabby Patty making machine in the kitchen, then walks up to a customer] Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that Krabby Patty you're eating?
Martha Smith: No. [Mr. Krabs shows her a pile of the gray sludge. The customer screams and runs out]
Mr. Krabs: See that? Without all your smoke &amp; mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage.
Frank: What'd he say? Garbage? [customers notice what's in the Krabby Patties and everyone runs out]
Carl: Eugene, you're in violation of your contract.
Mr. Krabs: Rules! Here's a rule for ya: people can't eat stain glass barstools! [throws barstool into the big screen TV and takes the cash register to the kitchen] I'll show you automated!
Carl: Mr. Blandy? Code red! Free thinker!
[Mr. Krabs shoves the cash register in the Krabby Patty making machine]
Howard: Mr. Krabs, is there a problem here?
Mr. Krabs: You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt! [Krabby Patty machine inflates and about to blow up.]
Carl: Oh, my. [The garbage blows up from the kitchen and blows everybody away off the Krabby O'Monday’s including the employees. The restaurant blows up and got destroyed. Carl was seen floating away.] Does this mean I won't get that raise, sir?
Howard: [he looks at the restaurant which is destroyed by the gray meat] It's ruined!
Friend: We'll have to sell it. We'll be lucky if we get a fraction of what we paid for it. [Mr. Krabs drives up with boat full of suitcases]
Mr. Krabs: I'll buy it for full price.
Friend: Sold. We won't need your contract anymore. [rips off the contract] Nice doing business with you.
Mr. Krabs: Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant. [laughs while Howard and his friends walks away, leaving SpongeBob and Squidward.] Well, we did it, boys. [puts the hats on them] The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends.
Squidward: Really, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: No, not really. Get back to work! [He hands them Spatula and the Mop. SpongeBob was glad while Squidward was annoyed leaving Mr. Krabs, who now  pushes the key to open the register and ends with dollar signs.]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [kisses some dollars] Hmm, I love you. [kisses some dollars] And I love you. [kisses some dollars] And I love you. [kisses some dollars and stuffs them in his pants] Heh—heh—heh. [money pops out from behind] And I love you too. Oooh. [laughs as money flies out of his pants and putting them in his shell] I tell ya, Mr. Squidward, today's been our [pulls down profit chart] best day of business in years. [pulls up profit chart] Yep, profits are so good, there's nothing that could possibly ruin this perfect—what?! No!
Squidward: [gets hit by SpongeBob's eye] Augh! [gets stepped on by SpongeBob] Ow!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you okay? [jumps onto Mr. Krabs, knocking all of the money on the floor] What's a matter? Is there too much money? I'll get rid of the money. [picks up the money and stuffs them in his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: What are you— [sticks his hands in SpongeBob's mouth and pulls the money out] Quit masticatin' me moolah! [stuffs his pockets with the money] I ain't upset about the money, boy. I'm upset about him. [turns SpongeBob around and points to Old Man Jenkins outside]
SpongeBob: Old Man Jenkins? But I love Old Man Jenkins! He always has old and interesting smells, [Old Man Jenkins' horrible smell withers the plants] and his bones make such funny noises, [Old Man Jenkins' bones in his legs jiggle] and his eyes are the milkiest shade of white [his eyes turn milky], and—
[Mr. Krabs shuts SpongeBob up and carries him into the kitchen while unintentionally stepping on Squidward. Old Man Jenkins walks up to the register.]
Mr. Krabs: Every day, it's the same routine...
Old Man Jenkins: I'll have...[straightens out his finger] a small coffee. [snaps his finger]
Squidward: [gives Old Man Jenkins coffee] Hmm, that'll be 25 cents.
Old Man Jenkins: I don't think so, Charlie. I get the senior discount. [holds out a penny, cuts it in half, and gives the other half to Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: [peaks out the kitchen with SpongeBob] Then he hogs that table all day... [Old Man Jenkins slurps his drink really loud, annoying the other customers] And annoys all me other customers.
Old Man Jenkins: Ahh! [smacks his lips and pours ketchup, mustard and mayo into his beard]
Mr. Krabs: And he don't buy nothin' else neither. He just makes that disgustin' condiment soup and listens to his radio, all for free. [Old Man Jenkins bangs on the radio to turn it on and sips on his "condiment soup"] And anytime someone says somethin' to him, it's always the same response...
Frankie Billy: Excuse me, could you turn the volume down on your soup?
Old Man Jenkins: Respect your elders! [hits Frankie Billy on the head]
Frankie Billy: Yes, sir! Sorry, sir! [runs off crying]
[Old Man Jenkins resumes sipping his "condiment soup."]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, it just makes me so steaming mad! [growls as a pot of soup is steaming on his back until he stops]
SpongeBob: [takes the pot off of Mr. Krabs' back] Ooh. [sniffs the soup] Ahh.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I won't stand for it no more! [stomps out of the kitchen and grabs Old Man Jenkins] It's time to kick out the coot!
Old Man Jenkins: Eh? What's going on now?
Medley: Hey! If that's how you treat the elderly, then I'm never eating another Krabby Patty in here again!
Bikini Bottomites: [murmurs in agreement] Me neither. Give the poor old guy a break.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. Uh, it's okay. I—I was just...shaking the dust off him. See? [shakes Old Man Jenkins really hard until his skeleton flies out of his skin] Ahh! Uh, wait. Let's see here. [grabs Old Man Jenkins' skeleton and puts his skin back on upside-down] Heh, there. Heh—heh—heh.
Old Man Jenkins: Respect your elders!
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins tuning up his banjo and preparing to sing.]
Old Man Jenkins: ♪Oohhhhh! Elders are you betters 'cause we're older. So all you whippersnappers get in line! Y'all best be respectful of your elders or we'll whip you with a soup spoon every time! [hits everyone including Squidward with a big soup spoon]♪
Mr. Krabs: [growls angrily and his eyes boil hot red] Ahh! [steam comes out of his shell]
SpongeBob: Well, gee, Mr. Krabs. If you want Old Man Jenkins to leave, why not just try asking him nicely?
Mr. Krabs: I think you oughta be the one to ask him nicely. [pushes SpongeBob over to Old Man Jenkins; imitates SpongeBob] "Oh, hi. I'm SpongeBob, and I love you, but will you go home, please? Hee—hee—hee—hee." [imitates Old Man Jenkins] "I'm Old Man Jenkins, and I'm a jerk who likes to cost Mr. Krabs money." [sees SpongeBob hugging Old Man Jenkins] What the? [grabs SpongeBob and pulls him back into the kitchen] What is going on, boy-o? Why ain't Jenkins vacatin' me restaurant?
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs. I couldn't ask Old Man Jenkins to leave after hearing his story. His feet hurt, [shows his sore feet] and his grandson never calls, [shows a picture of Old Man Jenkins' grandson] and he has to take a pill that helps him to remember to take his other pills. [holds up some medical pills] Why, he takes so many pills, he's more pill than man. [morphs himself into a pill and reverts to normal]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, time to step it up...to passive aggression. [chuckles evilly as he heads to the thermostat] This'll make him uncomfortable. [turns the knob to "nuclear" heat]
Bikini Bottomites: [starting to feel hot and sweaty] Ooh. Whew. Ooh.
[One customer fans himself with a Krabby Patty and dumps his soda in his pants to stay cool. One customer's Krabby Patty melts from the heat and melts along with it. Squidward is sweating up a puddle in his register boat and bails it out with a bucket. Although the heat is making everyone hot and sweaty, Old Man Jenkins, on the other hand, thinks it's cold in the restaurant and is shivering.]
Old Man Jenkins: [shivering] Ehh...ehh…. It's too cold in here for my old blood! [takes his beard off his face and uses it as a sweater] Show a little respect for your elders and turn up the heat!
[Mr. Krabs gets so mad that his entire body bursts into flames.]
Old Man Jenkins: Thank you!
Mr. Krabs: [crumbles into ashes, but gets back up] So you can take the heat, but can you take...the beat? [holds up a tape cassette]
[Mr. Krabs chuckles evilly and puts the cassette in the tape recorder. He turns up the volume and turns on the recorder. The recorder plays really loud music that everyone including SpongeBob and Squidward are bouncing up and down. The loud music shook the restaurant. Mr. Krabs turns off the recorder. But unfortunately, Old Man Jenkins was sound asleep the whole time.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps and looks into Old Man Jenkins' eye] I don't understand. How did you endure that cacophony?
Old Man Jenkins: [wakes up] Eh? [holds out a deaf horn] You say something? I'm a little deaf in my ears!
Mr. Krabs: Really? Then what's with the radio?
Old Man Jenkins: [opens the radio and shows him a cheese cracker inside] I like to cook on the vacuum tubes. [through deaf horn] Now show some respect for your elders! [munches on the cheese cracker]
Mr. Krabs: [growls and snaps off his right leg] Jenkins, I'm putting me foot down! You're ruining me business, and you're costing me money! Whoo, whoa. [puts his foot back on] Now, get out!
Old Man Jenkins: It ain't legal to throw out the elderly in this town. So respect your elders! [whacks Mr. Krabs with his cane]
Mr. Krabs: Respect...my...elders, hmm?
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins trimming his toenails.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Old Man Jenkins, I've got someone I'd like you to meet.
Old Man Jenkins: Hm? What's this about now?
Mr. Krabs: This here is me father. [shows his father, Victor Krabs] And he is older than you. So you best respect what he has to say.
Victor Krabs: Ahoy there, Jenkins. Time for you to be hoistin' your sails and movin' on, son!
Old Man Jenkins: Oh, I don't thinks so. [grabs something under the table and reveals his own father, Very Old Man Jenkins Sr.] This is my father, Very Old Man Jenkins Sr. He's even older than your old man, Krabs.
Very Old Man Jenkins Sr.: And I say we stay. Both you young 'uns should respect your elders.
Mr. Krabs: And I say both you Jenkinses should respect your elder...[opens the door and reveals Grandpa Redbeard] me grandpappy.
Old Man Jenkins: Two can play at that game. [grabs someone and reveals his grandfather, Grandpa Jenkins] Meet Grandpa Jenkins. Ha-ha!
Grandpa Redbeard: I remember the day when Krabby Patties used to cost a dime.
Grandpa Jenkins: Oh, yeah? Well, I remember when they cost a nickel. Hm?
Mr. Krabs: Okay, let's not give anyone ideas about cheap patties. Now, out with the old, and in with the even older. [knocks down a barrel to reveal his great-grandfather krabs] Right, Great-Grandpappy Krabs? Ha-ha!
Old Man Jenkins: Wake up, Great-Grandpop! [lifts the barrel to reveal his great-grandfather Jenkins] Defend the family's honor! [lifts his great-grandfather and kicks him over to great-grandfather Krabs]
Great Grandpa Krabs: Ooh, respect...someone.
Great Grandpa Jenkins: Am I an elder?
Mr. Krabs: [growls and does a spiritual ritual on the floor] Oh, Great-Great-Grandpa Krabs, return to us! I beseech thee! [the ghost of his great-great grandfather comes to life] Ha! You're older than they are! Kick 'em out!
Old Man Jenkins: [takes out a board and does his own spiritual ritual] I want to speak with my Great-Great Grandpa Jenkins! [his shell spins around and the ghost of his great-great grandfather comes to life] Get 'em, Ancient-Great-Grand-Pop!
[Mr. Krabs rubs a crystal ball and a ghost of his great-great-great grandfather comes to life.]
Old Man Jenkins: [reads an ancient book BOOK OF THE FILlETED] Youthum Ignorami, Elderus Respecticus! [his book summons the magic within and the ghosts of his ancestors comes to life]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles wildly as he sucks the ghosts of his ancestors from the graveyard] Here we go. [sucks the remaining ghosts of his ancestors and heads back to the Krusty Krab] Ha-ha! [releases his ancestors' ghosts]
Old Man Jenkins: You best respect your elders!
Mr. Krabs: My elders will teach your elders a little respect! Get 'em, Krabses!
Old Man Jenkins: Jenkinses, attack!
Mr. Krabs and Old Man Jenkins: Ha-ha! [both fight and slap at each other like immature children]
Ulysses S. Krabs: [getting in between the fight] Hey. Hey! Uh, you guys are kind of bumming us out.
Elizabeth Era Jenkins: Yes, we don't get to visit the land of the living very often.
Caveman Era Jenkins: And we just want to party!
Ancient Egypt Krabs: You two party-poopers need to respect your elders and vacate the premises!
[All of the ancestors kick Mr. Krabs and Old Man Jenkins out and they party inside the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] Looks like it's gonna be a while.
Old Man Jenkins: What do we do now?
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and Old Man Jenkins staying at the Chum Bucket with Plankton. They are seen playing cards together, much to Plankton's discomfort.]
Plankton: Come on, guys. You've been sitting here all day! Doesn't anyone want to order some chum?
Mr. Krabs: I'll just have a small coffee, please.
Old Man Jenkins: I got this one, Krabby...[holds out half his penny] with my senior discount. Here you go, Jimbo. [flicks half the penny onto Plankton's eye]
Plankton: Ow! That's it! Both of you out!
Mr. Krabs and Old Man Jenkins: Respect your elders!


Version #1 (Original Airing/The First 100 Episodes Version)
Narrator: Ahoy, kids. It's time for SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special!
Pirates: Hooray!
Narrator: And now the host of You Wish. He's got puffier pantaloons than Captain Kidd, and fuzzier facial hair than Blackbeard. He's America's favorite Pirate, Patchy of Encino!
Patchy: [opens the door] Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to me quarters. Why don't come on back on the galley, I'm cooking up a little treat for you today. (walks inside, and to the kitchen) It's call-in-and-vote time. You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if you're technologically inclined. Now this cartoon is different from most cartoons in that-
Potty: Bawk! In what way?
Patchy: Well, if it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
Potty: Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Patchy: Argh... [Potty flies away] Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Where'd you go? [enters something] Potty? You in there, buddy? Potty? Potty?
[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window]
Potty: [laughing and squawking] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Patchy: Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Now, what was I saying? (Patchy walks to his desk with so many phones and sits down) Now, this cartoon ain't like most of your "land-lubbing cartoons". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to, call the number that's scrolling down there at the bottom of the screen: 1 (800) 624-4094 or go to Nick.com. ["1 (800) 624-4094" appears on the bottom of the screen (in the First 100 Episodes version, it says "Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!" instead). Phone starts ringing. Patchy picks up phone] No, not now! Don't call till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because- [More phones start to ring] You're not gonna make this easy, are ya? Quiet! I'm not there! Belate that ringing! Stop! It's driving me mad!
[episode starts]
SpongeBob: (yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward] Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
Squidward: [Looks at the anchor and annoyed at SpongeBob's idiocy]That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
Patrick: [Stupidly]Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
SpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?
Patrick: How about...
Squidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
SpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
Patrick: Clean...
Squidward: [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
SpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!
Patrick: Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
Narrator: A few inches later...
SpongeBob: [points up] Ship!
Patrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
SpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship![A giant green ship is seen. Patrick is shocked to see he was wrong while Squidward is not fazed.]
Squidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
Squidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
Squidward: All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says "owner" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
SpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?
Patrick: I don't know. Why?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
Patrick: Yes!
SpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says "property of the Flying Dutchman"]
Flying Dutchman: Rawr!
SpongeBob: No, no, it's not "rawr!"
Flying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob: That's it! [Stupidly]Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
Flying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
SpongeBob: [Oblivious]It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward as he waits for answer]
Squidward: [Nervously]I...no, I don't.
SpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
Squidward: [laughs nervously] I never said that.
Flying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
SpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
Squidward: [screams] Ow.
Flying Dutchman: [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back!
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
Squidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?
Patrick: Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: How 'bout now?
Patrick: Uhh...
Squidward: [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: Now listen. [takes out a "Ghost Rule Book"] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
Squidward: Will we be getting business cards?
Flying Dutchman: [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.
Squidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [holds up a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick watch Squidward disappear from sight with a clearly worried expression.]
Flying Dutchman: [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
SpongeBob: [Terrified]No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.
Patrick: [Terrified as well]We'll do anything you say!
Flying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
Patrick: And I got this hat!
Flying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
SpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
Patrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
SpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
Patrick: I don't get it.
SpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
Flying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
SpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?
Flying Dutchman: Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick are scared and start mopping]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
Flying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [bleats like a sheep]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
Flying Dutchman: [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [bleats like a sheep]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
[Very long and awkward silence]
Flying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
SpongeBob: Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy. The Flying Dutchman stares wide eyed, then nervously blows on the telescope, spinning it slightly to land on a little kid]
Billy: [sing-song voice] I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
Flying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
Patrick: Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
SpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
Flying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
Flying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confuse]
SpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
Flying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
Patrick: How does he do that?
Flying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!
Billy: Those guys are dorks.
Flying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
SpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Patrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
SpongeBob: Like movie passes?
Patrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
Flying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
SpongeBob: You're setting us free?
Flying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
Patrick: Wait, I have an idea!
SpongeBob: Really?! What is it?
Patrick: Let's leave!
SpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
Patrick: Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume. Someone even goes as far as removing Patrick's gas mask and spraying him in the face with perfume]
SpongeBob: [panting]I always hate going in there!
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
Flying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and sees SpongeBob and Patrick peeping on him before escaping.]
Flying Dutchman: [On the ship, SpongeBob and Patrick are running but the Dutchman pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
SpongeBob: Never!
Flying Dutchman: Okay, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No! [Sock begins to tear]
Flying Dutchman: [panicking]Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
Patrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Flying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
Patrick: Make it five.
Flying Dutchman: Four.
Patrick: Three. Take it or leave it.
Flying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
SpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
Patrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
Flying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [Taps Patrick on the shoulder]Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [Squidward is screaming as he falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]
Squidward: [Relieved]Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [disappears and re-appears on the ship.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back![Squidward looks around shocked.]
SpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
Squidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
Patrick: [Protesting]Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
SpongeBob: [Angrily]Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny-meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...
Voting Guy: All hands! All hands! Time to vote! It's voting time!
Patchy: Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good Ol' SpongeBob? Just dial the number below: 1 (800) 624-4094 or go to Nick.com and tell us who you be choosing. ["1 (800) 624-4094" appears on the bottom of the screen (again, in the First 100 Episodes version it has been changed to "Yikes matey! Original 800 number as aired has been retired to Davy Jones locker!")] My trusty crew is eagerly awaiting your call. [Potty is shown sleeping against phones and a quote bubble with "Z" slides in] So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, and we'll be right back to announce...the winner! [Commercial break (in the original version, this happens)] That's it, kids! Keep calling! It's almost time! Get those votes in! A-Ha-Ha! WHOO! Democracy! A-Ha-Ha! WHOO! This is Patchy. Please hold. Potty's not here. Well, not yet. A-HA-HA-HA! [After commercial break] Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because it’s time for you to walk the plank! [Screen reads: PLEASE STAND BY] Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner! [blows horn] But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter-ology, you didn't choose...Patrick. [An image of Patrick is shown, with a skull in front of him.] But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh god!
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] My mother told me to pick the very best one and you are it! [Stops on Patrick.]
SpongeBob: That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
Patrick: Um...
Squidward: Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time... [demonstrates the length of eternity as if it were a piece of string. Patrick's eyes look at each end] Understand?!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.
Patrick: Uhh...
SpongeBob: That's not gonna do it! Think harder!
Patrick: Uhh...
Squidward and SpongeBob: [overlapping] Come on! You can do it! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Think really hard! Put on your thinking cap!
Patrick: Uhh... [Inside Patrick's eye is a toaster that brings up some toast.] Okay! I've got it.
Flying Dutchman: Thy wish is granted.
Patrick: [Chewing on gum.] Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum? [SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked.]
Squidward: You wished for gum?
Patrick: Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
[Each take a piece of gum. Later, we see Flying Dutchman with a big belly while everyone is begging for out.]
Flying Dutchman: Ahh, minty.
Patchy: Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Malarkey! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh! [An image of Squidward is shown, with a skull in front of him.] It appears you didn't vote for Squidward! I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either. But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Meeny-Miney-Mo finger landed on Squidward!
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [Stops on Squidward]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!
Squidward: That's right! And you know what I wish?
Patrick: No!
Squidward: I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Flying Dutchman: So be it.
SpongeBob: Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.
Patrick: Hi.
Squidward: That's not what I meant!
Flying Dutchman: Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner. [Flying Dutchman appears with a big belly]
SpongeBob: And what did you say your name was?
Squidward: I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
SpongeBob: Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward. [Tries to pronounce it right] We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess. [Laughs.]
Patchy: And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because it's time to announce...the winner! The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well, what do you know? The winner is...SpongeBob! [A flag is shown with SpongeBob with the words "Winner" on the left side, Patchy sniffs the air] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
Potty: Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]
Patchy: And now, the most requested ending! Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor]
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
Squidward: Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house but you can only see their heads]
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Hooray!
SpongeBob: We're home!
Patrick: You did it, SpongeBob. We're safe!
Squidward: But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
Flying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. Fruit prevents scurvy! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast.]
Patchy: [sitting at the couch crying] Hold on! Sorry about that, kids! It’s just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lubbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now you're an official big time cartoon decision maker! [Cuts to a bunch of monkeys at a zoo] Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks, Potty! Potty!
Potty: Squawk! I quit! I quit!
Patchy: [growls] Well, that's it folks. Right now, I've got a little "employee management" to take care of. Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage!
Potty: Brawk! I don't think so!
Narrator: [while they argue] And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special. Thanks for voting.
Patchy: Ow!

Version #2 (Reruns)
Narrator: And now, it's time for Patchy's Pick. Hosted by: SpongeBob's number one fan, Patchy the Pirate.
Patchy: [opens the door] Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to Patchy's Pick. Why don't come on back on the galley, I got a little treat for you today. [walks to a red curtain and shows a large cue card with the title "Shanghaied" on it] We're gonna see me favorite show, "Shanghaied"! Ta-da!
Potty: Boring!
Patchy: Well, if it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
Potty: Bawk! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Patchy: Argh... [Potty flies away] Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Where'd you go? [enters something] Potty? You in there, buddy? Potty? Potty?
[Then the screen reveals that Patchy is in a cannon that is pointing outside the window]
Potty: [laughing and squawking] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Patchy: Get me out of here, you scurvy bird! [The cannon blasts Patchy out and Patchy screams; he lands in a neighboring house which sinks like a boat. Patchy returns, still smoking from the cannon blast] Well, roll the cartoon. [screen fades to black, episode starts]
SpongeBob: (yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward] Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
Squidward: That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
SpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?
Patrick: How about...
Squidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
SpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
Patrick: Clean...
Squidward: [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
SpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!
Patrick: Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
Narrator: A few inches later...
SpongeBob: [points up] Ship!
Patrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
SpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship!
Squidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
Squidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
Squidward: All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says "owner" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
SpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?
Patrick: I don't know. Why?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
Patrick: Yes!
SpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says "property of the Flying Dutchman"]
Flying Dutchman: Rawr!
SpongeBob: No, no, it's not "rawr!"
Flying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob: That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
Flying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
SpongeBob: It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward]
Squidward: I...no, I don't.
SpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
Squidward: [laughs nervously] I never said that.
Flying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
SpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
Squidward: [screams] Ow.
Flying Dutchman: [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back!
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
Squidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
Flying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?
Patrick: Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: How 'bout now?
Patrick: Uhh...
Squidward: [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
Flying Dutchman: Now listen. [takes out a "Ghost Rule Book"] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book] And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
Squidward: Will we be getting business cards?
Flying Dutchman: [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.
Squidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [shows a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick look at Squidward in blank worried faces.]
Flying Dutchman: [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
SpongeBob: No! We know our place now, Mr. Dutchman.
Patrick: We'll do anything you say!
Flying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
Patrick: And I got this hat!
Flying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
SpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
Patrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
SpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
Patrick: I don't get it.
SpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
Flying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
SpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?
Flying Dutchman: Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
Flying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [screams]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
Flying Dutchman: [howls like a wolf]
SpongeBob: [screams]
Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
[Very long and awkward silence]
Flying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
SpongeBob: Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it slightly to land on a little kid]
Billy: [sing-song voice] I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
Flying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
Patrick: Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
SpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
Flying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
Flying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confused]
SpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
Flying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
Patrick: How does he do that?
Flying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!
Billy: Those guys are dorks.
Flying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
SpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Patrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
SpongeBob: Like movie passes?
Patrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
Flying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
SpongeBob: You're setting us free?
Flying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
Patrick: Wait, I have an idea!
SpongeBob: Really?! What is it?
Patrick: Let's leave!
SpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
Patrick: Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
SpongeBob: I always hate going in there!
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
Flying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
SpongeBob: Never!
Flying Dutchman: Okay, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob, but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection] Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No! [Sock begins to tear]
Flying Dutchman: Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
Patrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Flying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.

Squidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
Patrick: Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
SpongeBob: Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny-meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on SpongeBob]
Squidward: Hurry, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish that the Dutchman was a vegetarian! [Flying Dutchman turns into a vegetarian and SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward re-appear in front of SpongeBob's house, but you can only see their heads]

Patrick: You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!
Squidward: But why have we been turned into fruits? [their bodies have been turned into fruits and they are in a blender]
Flying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. [slices some fruits to the blender] Fruit prevents scurvy! [he whistles as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward scream and bounce away in the blender] Hey, get back here with that! [Flying Dutchman chases them around the ship, which is now a hippie-themed Volkswagen with a main mast. Patchy reappears]
Patchy: Ahoy, children! I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls enjoyed the show because it's time for you to walk the plank! [Screen reads: PLEASE STAND BY] Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time for fan mail! [blows horn]
Old-time crowd: Hooray!
Patchy: And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, so get ready to blow milk out of your nose because we're gonna open a letter! [Potty flies to Patchy with the letter. There is a lit fuse on Potty's head] The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant.
Potty: Brawk, you're not welcome.
Patchy: [sniffs the air] Hey, Potty, do you smell something? [notices the fuse] Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
Potty: Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk! [Potty blows up along with Patchy; Patchy coughs up a feather and recovers from the blast]
Patchy: Well, that's it for Patchy's Pick. Hooray! [Potty collapses to the floor and Patchy frowns]

Different endings
There are various endings to "Shanghaied". Differences between each other are the different fates of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward, depending on who the Flying Dutchman picked. Below are the different endings:

[uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on Patrick]
SpongeBob: [worried] That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.
Patrick: Umm...
Squidward: Wait, Patrick. Listen, I do not particularly want to be trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time... [demonstrates the length of eternity as if it were a piece of string. Patrick's eyes look at each end] Understand?
SpongeBob: [rushes in] Patrick, you've got to think harder than you ever thought before.
Patrick: Uhh...
SpongeBob: That's not going to do it! Think harder!
Patrick: [thinks harder] Uhh...
Squidward: [simultaneously with SpongeBob] You can do it! Come on! Put on your thinking cap! Come on!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously with Squidward] Come on, Patrick! Yes, think, think really hard! [Patrick goes really intensely thinking] Yes, Patrick! You're doing good!
Patrick: [his head's toaster ejects bread] Okay! I got it!
Flying Dutchman: Thou wish is granted.
[Gum appears in Patrick's pocket. Patrick eats some gum.]
Patrick: Oh, I'm sorry... Want some gum?
[SpongeBob and Squidward are shocked]
Squidward: You wished for gum?
Patrick: Well, if we're going to be there forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
[SpongeBob and Squidward take a piece of gum each and chews some gum as well]
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward complain in the Flying Dutchman's belly]
Flying Dutchman: Ahh... Minty!

Squidward's ending

Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish.

[finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] You are it! [stops on Squidward]
SpongeBob: Squidward! You get to have a wish! A great big wish!
Squidward: That's right! And you know what I wish?
Patrick: No!
Squidward: I wish that I never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
Flying Dutchman: So be it. [magically makes SpongeBob and Patrick not know Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hi there. I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob and this is my associate Patrick.
Patrick: Hi.
Squidward: That's not what I meant!
Flying Dutchman: Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner. [grabs out a metal knife and fork]
SpongeBob: [in the Flying Dutchman's belly] And what did you say your name was?
Squidward: [also in the Flying Dutchman's belly] I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
SpongeBob: Oh, nice to meet you, Squid Ward. We have plenty of time to know each other, I guess. [laughs]

Version #3 (Without Patchy Segments)
 SpongeBob: (yawns) Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside! [checks in the cereal box but then a giant anchor comes crashing through SpongeBob's house] Holy shrimp! [runs out to Squidward]Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward! [Squidward pokes his head through his window] Squidward! The sky had a baby!
 Squidward: That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away! [Patrick comes over]
 Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
 SpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?
 Patrick: How about...
 Squidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away! [Anchor crashes into Squidward's house] Now look what you've done!
 SpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean! [SpongeBob and Patrick show their spotless hands]
 Patrick: Clean...
 Squidward: [on top of his house] Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
 SpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top? [Squidward starts to climb rope]
 SpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!
 Patrick: Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick start climbing rope also]
 Narrator: A few inches later...
 SpongeBob: [points up] Ship!
 Patrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
 SpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship!
 Squidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
 SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
 Squidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
 SpongeBob: Squid, wait! [all 3 reach the top]
 Squidward: All right, who owns this crate? [notices a door that says "owner" and begins to knock on it] Come on out! I wanna file a complaint! [SpongeBob looks around the ship]
 SpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?
 Patrick: I don't know. Why?
 SpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell? [Squidward rings the doorbell]
 Patrick: Yes!
 SpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name. [SpongeBob walks by a barrel that says "property of the Flying Dutchman"]
 Flying Dutchman: Rawr!
 SpongeBob: No, no, it's not "rawr!"
 Flying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!
 SpongeBob: That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
 Flying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
 SpongeBob: It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you. [Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Squidward]
 Squidward: I...no, I don't.
 SpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all? [Flying Dutchman glares angrily at Squidward]
 Squidward: [laughs nervously] I never said that.
 Flying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
 SpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship. [shoots fire out his nose frying up Squidward]
 Squidward: [screams] Ow.
 Flying Dutchman: [looks over to SpongeBob and Patrick] You're next!
 SpongeBob and Patrick: [jumps off the ship] That was a close one! [land back on the ship]
 Flying Dutchman: Welcome back!
 SpongeBob: [he and Patrick scream and jump off the ship] That was a closer one! [land back on the ship]
 Flying Dutchman: Welcome back! [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the ship]
 Squidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick land back on the ship]
 Flying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?
 Patrick: Probably. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
 Flying Dutchman: How 'bout now?
 Patrick: Uhh...
 Squidward: [covers Patrick's mouth with tentacle] No, no, they're not. Whew. [Flying Dutchman zaps Squidward]
 Flying Dutchman: Now listen. [takes out a "Ghost Rule Book"] Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! [closes rule book]And, uhh [opens rule book], ever. [closes rule book]
 Squidward: Will we be getting business cards?
 Flying Dutchman: [zaps Squidward] Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.
 Squidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! [shows a green jockstrap] Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea... [Dutchman picks up Squidward] Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... [Flying Dutchman unzips something in mid-air] Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act? [Flying Dutchman tosses Squidward into the Fly of Despair. Squidward screams as he falls inside the Fly of Despair. SpongeBob and Patrick look at Squidward in blank worried faces.]
 Flying Dutchman: [closes Fly of Despair] Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
 SpongeBob: No! We know our place now, Mr. Dutchman.
 Patrick: We'll do anything you say!
 Flying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! [hands them a mop and a bucket]
 SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
 Patrick: And I got this hat!
 Flying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
 SpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
 Patrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
 SpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
 Patrick: I don't get it.
 SpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
 Flying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
 SpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?
 Flying Dutchman: Get moving! [SpongeBob and Patrick start mopping]
 SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket] A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
 Flying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! [howls like a wolf]
 SpongeBob: [screams]
 Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
 Flying Dutchman: [howls like a wolf]
 SpongeBob: [screams]
 Patrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! [Flying Dutchman going to howl again, but Patrick cuts him off] Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
 [Very long and awkward silence]
 Flying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
 SpongeBob: Let's see who we can find. [spins telescope on ground] Captain, there's a guy we can scare. [telescope points to a big tough guy then Flying Dutchman blows on the telescope spinning it slightly to land on a little kid]
 Billy: [sing-song voice] I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three!
 Flying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
 Patrick: Moving behind the rocks! [ship moves scratches and tears up through the rocky parts of the sea]
 SpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.
 Flying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal. [Flying Dutchman scares Billy from behind a rock]
 Flying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [points to SpongeBob and Patrick who just get confused]
 SpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.
 Flying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out and SpongeBob does a little trick with his fingers]
 Patrick: How does he do that?
 Flying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.
 SpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!
 Billy: Those guys are dorks.
 Flying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks. [goes back to showing SpongeBob and Patrick steering through the rocks tearing up the ship]
 SpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman goes through Bikini Bottom terrorizing citizens while SpongeBob and Patrick do stupid tricks. Later shown the ship is still getting wrecked] You're good.. You're good. You're good. [Flying Dutchman scares another citizen while SpongeBob and Patrick figure- skate in purple tights. back on the ship] Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
 Patrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
 SpongeBob: Like movie passes?
 Patrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?! [both start bouncing insanely]
 Flying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! [both stop] This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
 SpongeBob: You're setting us free?
 Flying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream]
 Patrick: Wait, I have an idea!
 SpongeBob: Really?! What is it?
 Patrick: Let's leave!
 SpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department. [points to a room full of perfume and customers]
 Patrick: Let's do it. [they try to run through the department but get sprayed with all sorts of perfume]
 SpongeBob: I always hate going in there!
 Patrick: Yeah.
 SpongeBob: [hears something strange] Wait! Listen! [Flying Dutchman is in his room]
 Flying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen... [notices sock is gone and pops out in front of SpongeBob and Patrick] Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
 SpongeBob: Never!
 Flying Dutchman: Okay, then... [tries to zap SpongeBob, but SpongeBob holds up the sock as protection]Give it to me!
 SpongeBob: No! [Sock begins to tear]
 Flying Dutchman: Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
 Patrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.
 Flying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
 Patrick: Make it five.
 Flying Dutchman: Four.
 Patrick: Three. Take it or leave it.
 Flying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
 SpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?
 Patrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier! [clock goes backwards one minute]
 Flying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left. [Patrick smiles with embarrassment at an angry SpongeBob]
 SpongeBob: Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this! [falls through a hole in the Fly Of Despair and crashes onto his bed]
 Squidward: Boy, I'm glad all that's over! [re-appears on the ship]
 SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back!
 SpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I... [realizing] just used the second one.
 Squidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
 Patrick: Wait! I think it belongs to me! [everyone starts to argue] Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
 SpongeBob: Well, that's not right because... [their arguing devolves into incoherent yelling, babbling and shouting]
 Flying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish. [uses the eeny- meenie-minie-mo method] Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... [then one of the above endings.]


[Opens with SpongeBob lying in bed with his teeth chattering. He hears a crash and sits up, awake. He thinks he imagined it and sighs with relief, but then there's another crashing sound. He picks up the phone to call for help]
SpongeBob: Hello? Hello! [Realizes the phone line is cut] Huh? The line’s been cut. [Slams the phone down] Barnacles! [Puts on an army helmet and gets out a tennis racket] I guess I’d go better take a look. [Gets up and legs start shaking] [Shakes around tennis racket] Who's there? Stay back, I'm armed! [Slips on a toy fire truck] Whoa! Whoa! [Falls down stairs] Ha, hey! [Flicks on the light switch. Novelty teeth chattering] Aha, wind-up novelty teeth! How did you wind up down here? Dahaha! [Fancy boot runs in circles] What the heck is going on with my fancy boot? [Goes over to fancy boot] Hey, knock it off! [Boot goes in circles faster] Alright, I warned you! [Whacks boot. The racket comes back around and hits SpongeBob in the face] You're a dirty fighter... I got you now! Hiya! [Karate chops boot. Gary bounces out] Gary? [Heads towards a sand castle near the wall] Noooooooooo! [Gary crashes underneath bucket with soap in it] Gary! [Lifts off bucket] Hooa! [SpongeBob removes the soap from Gary’s mouth] Phew! Thank goodness. For a minute, I thought you were hurt. [pats his shell, which breaks] [shocked] Gary, I've - I've broke your shell.
Gary: Meoooow! [starts crying]
SpongeBob: Oh no, you're in pain! Don't worry, I'll make it better. [Gives Gary a tight hug and Gary screams] Sorry about that. Oh, I know, [Picks up the cracks from Gary's shell] here, just use a little tape and there ya go, good as new! [Shell breaks off] Oh. Well, that's alright, because we'll find a new shell for ya. [later] SpongeBob
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Yeah, you're right, too gaudy. [Pulls out a Santa hat] No, too last season. [Pulls out a gorilla mask] Well, I need that. Ahahaha, look, Gary! [Pulls out pair of SquarePants] Here, try this on for size.
Gary: Meow...
SpongeBob: Of course it's a shell. [Gary looks at SpongeBob sternly] Aw, come on, don't look at me like that. [The slime on Gary's back covers the pants and the wet pants go soggy]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, you're right, it's not a shell. [Starts thinking] Oh! [Comes back with a clear helmet over his head] Greetings, earthling, I am SpongeBob. I come from the future. Dahahaha. [takes off helmet] I bet this'll look great. [Puffy skin swirls up inside helmet]. Ew. I can see why snail shells aren't clear. [Takes helmet from Gary] Hmmm.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Here it is, Gary, your new shell! [puts on race driver helmet] Oh, you look ready to ride. [Gary throws magazine at SpongeBob] "Shell Spiffy". Great idea, Gare, I'll order you a new shell. Are there any you have your mind on, ol' buddy? [Shows Gary magazine]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, page 72. Here it is - wow! [Looks the same as Gary's old shell]. "This stylish fully insulated, dual coat ceramic shell comes with automatic rest-room facilities standard, and for the affordable price of just... 9595.95"!? Isn't there a place I can get a quality shell without spending a fortune?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Commercial? What commercial? [he looks at the TV, where a commercial is playing]
Commercial Voice: Uh-oh, now look what you've done. You've broke your snail's shell again.
Actor: Yeah. Now what do I do?
Angry Jack: You come on down to Angry Jack's Shell Emporium!
Commercial Voice: [Drop scene with shop name on it] Angry Jack's!
Angry Jack: I'm so angry about my massive inventory that I'm slashing prices like crazy.
Commercial Voice: Jack's angry!
Angry Jack: 99.99, buy this refurbished shell and I'm angry about it! [holds up a pink shell] Or what about this one? Brand new plastic shell, super gloss coat, only 39.99. [The price flashes in front of his eyes] Hey! Get those numbers outta my face! DID I MENTION I'M ANGRY?!?!
Commercial Voice: He's seething with rage!
Angry Jack: The wife's gone for good, so I'm gonna sell sell sell all these shell shell shells! So come on down to Angry Jack's now!
Commercial Voice: Jack is real mad! Don't bring your kids.
Angry Jack: And remember, I'll match or beat anyone's advertised rage or is absolutely – [Notices SpongeBob] Hey, what are you doing in my commercial?
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Angry Jack. Gary here needs a new shell, and we knew you would help us find one. Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at me right now?
Angry Jack: Nah, I just do that to make my commercials louder. And louder is the same as better! Now, let's see if I can't get you into a new shell. Hmmm. [starts scanning shelves] There she is! [Takes the same shell as Gary's old one] There you are, little guy.
Gary: [happily] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, it's perfect! Just like the old one hey, buddy? [Shell falls off and breaks] Now, it... really looks like the old one, eh, buddy?
Gary: [irritably] Meow.
Angry Jack: Hey, accidents will happen. Why don't we try this one? [Picks up yellow shell with orange patches]
SpongeBob: Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it. But first I've gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off, eh, buddy? [SpongeBob pushes down shell so hard it cracks and breaks. Angry Jack looks at SpongeBob angrily] Oops. Hey, what about that one? [Walks to a shell with purple and orange stripes on it. Turns around to take to Gary, but whacks it on Angry Jack] Oops, sorry, Jack. Hey, how much is that one? [Picks up shades of pink stripes. Trips over lace and drops shell]
Angry Jack: Why don't you just hold your snail? I'll take care of the shells.
SpongeBob: Good idea, Angry.
Angry Jack: So, how do ya like this one? [Puts on very bright-lighted shell]
SpongeBob: Well, it certainly is shiny.
Angry Jack: It's our most reflective model.
SpongeBob: Oh, that is bright. [stumbles backwards] Can't... see! Ow, what was that? S'cuse me. [Bashes into shell shelves and knocks them over one by one. Shelves knock each other over like dominoes. Some shell shelves spell 'oops'] Why – can't – I – stop – breaking – shells! [Screams and falls off shelf he was running along. View from outside Angry Jack's store] Whoops. Say, Jack, I don't suppose you have any more to show me?
Angry Jack: I do have one more available. It's the only certified indestructible shell I've ever seen, but I'm sure you'll find a way.
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait. Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first, [shoes pop from under shell bits] shoes are tied. Hands are dry. [pulls out a roll of bubble wrap] And now, a thick layer of bubble wrap. [starts wrapping shell in bubble wrap. Picks up shell, but the actual shell falls out of the bubble wrap layer and breaks] You, um, you sure you don't have any more in the back?
Angry Jack: The back? There is no back anymore.
SpongeBob: Well, look on the bright side. I reduced your inventory for you.
Angry Jack: Reduced?! You destroyed everything! And now, you're gonna have to pay.
SpongeBob: Are you really angry or ya just trying to sound louder?
Angry Jack: I'm really angry!
Commercial Voice: Blistering fury!
Angry Jack: And I demand immediate payment!
SpongeBob: [Takes about 40 cents out his pocket] Take it, it's all my savings.
Angry Jack: This? This isn't enough to repay my fortune! I'm gonna need more.
SpongeBob: Sorry, that's all I got. Honest.
Angry Jack: No, it's not. You've got two arms and two legs, dontcha?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Angry Jack: Gimme one of each.
SpongeBob: Okay. [does so]
Angry Jack: I'll also need some internal organs. [SpongeBob hands one over] And an eyeball. [SpongeBob gives him an eyeball] And your dothes. [cut to SpongeBob walking in Bikini Bottom carrying a still shell-less Gary]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Oh, Gary. How I wish your shell could grow back like my appendages. [sees box] Hey, I've got an idea! [SpongeBob draws a shell pattern on the box]
Gary: [angry tone] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, it's not that bad! Square looks good on anybody! [Gary starts to cry, so SpongeBob does, too] Oh, who am I kidding? It looks terrible on you! I know, Gary, I ruined your life! Do you have to rub it in?!? [Mr. Krabs pokes his head of of the dumpster behind them]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's with all that sniveling?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I just, - oh - well, um… never mind that, boy. What's your problem?
SpongeBob: I destroyed Gary's shell, and now I can't find a replacement, so I guess he'll just spend the rest of his days as a lowly slug! [he bawls]
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: There there, boy, there there. It's not that bad. I'm sure you'll think of something.
SpongeBob: [suddenly gets an idea] Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'd be honored to help you and your snivelin' snail during such desperate times, 'cause I love helping others, like helping myself. Now, how much ya got?
SpongeBob: Nothing, Mr. Krabs. I'm broke.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. I see [walks away disappointed]
SpongeBob: Wait, Mr. Krabs! If you help me get Gary a shell, I'll, work for free for the rest of the year.
Mr. Krabs: Only if I get to cut your health benefit for ya.
SpongeBob: Deal! [they high five. Cut to SpongeBob's house; his teeth are chattering, and he wakes up again] Another bad dream. [he sees a scary silhouette] Aaargh! [he shines a flashlight at Gary] Mr. Krabs?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, I'm not used to your new shell. [something pink and fleshy enters through SpongeBob's bedroom window]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy, I need to borrow a blanket.
SpongeBob: There ya go, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, boyo. Now I'm all toasty.
SpongeBob: Ahh. I guess all's shell that ends shell, huh, Gary? Dahahah! That's a good one. [Gary goes furious and crawls back, Gary slams the door locking SpongeBob out] Gary? [pounds on the door] Gary? [Gary turns off the bedroom light] Gary?


[episode starts at the Krusty Krab at night]
SpongeBob: [Flips sign from "open" to "closed] Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Closing time already?
SpongeBob: I just served a Krabby Patty to the last customer.
Mr. Krabs: Well, have a good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, is it okay if I buy a Krabby Patty to go for my pet snail Gary?
Mr. Krabs: I thought those things ate mostly kibble.
SpongeBob: It's a special treat. Just to get him ready for tomorrow...
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Right! Okay, that makes- Wait, what's tomorrow?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, did you forget?
Mr. Krabs: Probably.
SpongeBob: Tomorrow is "Bring Your Pet To Work" day!
Mr. Krabs: I don't need a special day for that. Squidward's here every day!
Squidward: [Stood in the doorway] Nice. [Walks away] REAL NICE!
SpongeBob: Umm... Can I buy that patty?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. Sure.
SpongeBob: Alright! Gary's gonna be so excited!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob! I almost forgot. The price is double for pets because they're so special.
SpongeBob: Good idea! [Gives Mr. Krabs some change] Thanks again, Mr. Krabs! [Leaves, then pops out of nowhere] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:  Whoa, what?
SpongeBob: [speaking gibberish]
Mr. Krabs: What, what?!
SpongeBob: We're all out of Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Did you check the freezer?!
SpongeBob: I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!
Mr. Krabs: What about the freezer in the attic?
SpongeBob: We don't have an attic.
Mr. Krabs: No attic?!
SpongeBob: You sold it, remember?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah.
[Plankton and Karen are spying on Krabs and SpongeBob from the Chum Bucket with a telescope]
Plankton: Now what are they saying, Karen? Karen?!
Karen: I have no idea.
Plankton: What? I thought you said you could read lips!
Karen: I can, but you took my telescope away!
[Plankton gives the telescope to Karen]
Mr. Krabs: [In the telescope] Well, that settles it, SpongeBob. We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: A fresh batch?
Mr. Krabs: That's what I said. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
Plankton: Okay, now what's he saying?
Karen: He said that they're going to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
Plankton: A fresh batch of—ooh, this is good. This is really good!
SpongeBob: When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What?
Plankton: Okay, what'd he just say?
Karen: What?
Plankton: I said, "What'd he just say?"
Karen: He said, "What?"
Plankton: I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he just said!
Karen: I know that, and I'm saying he said, "What?"!
Plankton: I know that! Wait... oh, he said, "What?".
Karen: Yes!
SpongeBob: Wow, a whole new fresh batch of Krabby Patties! Gary's gonna go crazy!
Mr. Krabs: You know, SpongeBob, heh, might not be such a good idea bringing a dirty snail into the kitchen. I think we might just want to reschedule "Bring Your Pet To Work" day.
SpongeBob: No! Mr. Krabs, I promise that Gary will be sparkly clean. I'll give him an extra long bath tonight!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, okay. Just make sure he's healthy and clean!
Plankton: Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties? Ooh, I think I smell a plan!
[Bubbles change the scene showing SpongeBob's House]
SpongeBob: Gary! I brought you a delicious treat!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: There you are, Gare-bear. I brought you some kelp fries. [Holds a bag and shakes it upside down. A plate of kelp fries falls out and Gary sniffs them] I was going to bring you a Krabby Patty, but we ran out! I'll go get your bath ready, while you enjoy those. [Gary gets scared and runs away while SpongeBob fills the bath tub] Gary! Your bath is ready! Gary? Gary? [Eats a kelp fry] Gary? [Walks in the kitchen] Gary?! [He sees Gary hiding under the counter] Gary, not again. Come out of there, it's dirty! [Grabs Gary] Gotcha! Come on, Gary, quit messing arou.... [Tries to pull him out but accidentally trips and Gary flies into a pot on top of the refrigerator and is covered in mud]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [Upset] Great, Gary, just great. Now you're gonna need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not gonna come down from there, are you?
Gary: Meow. [No]
SpongeBob: Ugh! You win, we'll bathe you in the morning. [Flicks off the light and leaves.. Bubbles change the scene. Gary hears a knock on the door and comes to answer it]
Plankton: [In a disguise wearing a wig and has a suitcase] Good morning, sir! My name is Sheldon R. Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited. Can I ask you a question? Are you tired of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of...
SpongeBob: [Offscreen] Gary! I'm going to start the bath!
Plankton: Look, I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?
Gary: Meow.
Plankton: Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. For not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here![Opens suitcase and a large poster pops out] At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself, this could be...
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Gary! The bath is ready!
Plankton: ...all yours! Now I know what you're thinking, but I got you covered! [Shows Gary an orange inflatable shell] A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge, of course.
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Gary! Your bath is ready!
[Gary immediately puts on the shell and leaves]
Plankton: Have a pleasant stay! Bon voyage! [Closes the door and takes off the disguise, goes into Gary's real shell, and puts small balls on his antennas, making him look like Gary. He laughs] If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet, I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula and destroy Krabs once and for all!
SpongeBob: [Appears walking next to Plankton in the shell and mistakes him for Gary] Ah-ha, there you are, Gare-Bear! [Picks him up and walks up the stairs] Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for "Bring your pet to work" day! And today is the day! [Goes to the bath tub and drops "Gary" in the tub] First, I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!
Plankton: Wha...? [Gets squirted with the gel and is covered in shampoo]
SpongeBob: Oh, smells nice, doesn't it?
Plankton: Ugh...
SpongeBob: [Takes "Gary" and holds him above his head] Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime! [Scrubs Plankton by dragging him back and forth like a sponge]
Plankton: [screams]
SpongeBob: [Stops scrubbing him] Bet that feels good, huh?
Plankton: [Coughs and Chokes] Curses! I mean... meow?
SpongeBob: [Nervous] Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?
Plankton: I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow! [Soap washes off and reveals his body to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [Worried] Gary! You're turning green! And talking!
Plankton: No, I'm not.
SpongeBob: [Rushes down the stairs holding "Gary"] We gotta get you to the pet hospital!
Plankton: Pet hospital?! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!
SpongeBob: You're right! I'll call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late. Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick. [Bubbles change the scene showing the hospital. To Sadie] Excuse me, nurse. My snail has been talking and turning green. Is he sick?
[Sadie takes a look at "Gary"]
Plankton: [Afraid she might notice it's him] Meow? [Sadie throws bottles of medicine on the ceiling while shrieking in horror]
SpongeBob: Is that yes? Or no?
Sadie: I have never seen such a drastic case! Rush this snail to the intensive care unit stat!
Plankton: Intensive care unit?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary. These are professionals.
[Bubbles change the scene and Plankton is sitting on a bed]
Plankton: [Sees a large computer, thinking it's Karen] Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.
Sadie: [Walks in the room] Don't worry. We're just going to subject you to a series of invasive tests. It'll be over before you know it. [She pulls a curtains and we hear Plankton screaming in pain while the screen shows the hospital. SpongeBob breathes heavily thinking about "Gary"]
Jennifer-Millie: Sir, all the doctor is saying is that your snail is still in the intensive care unit, and we just need to run a couple more tests.
Purple Doctorfish: [To Jennifer] That's not what I'm saying at all.
SpongeBob:  Oh, Gary! [crying]
Purple Doctorfish: [To SpongeBob] Yes, I'll be honest with you, son, we've tried everything we can. We just can't find out anything wrong with him. I've never seen anything like it.
SpongeBob: Please try to save him, doctor!
[Cut to Plankton]
Plankton: [Sleeps on the bed, then wakes up paranoid] No! No more! Please! I-I-I-I...
Sadie: Relax, Gary, the tests are over. I'm just here to give you a little pill.
Plankton: Whew! That's a relief.
Sadie: [Takes out a giant pill bigger than Plankton] Now, open wide. [Plankton screams as Sadie puts the pill in his mouth]
Sadie: That wasn't so bad, was it? [Plankton has the pill in his mouth, tears up, and spits out the pill all over her] That's not good. [Cuts to SpongeBob still crying] Uh, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: [stops crying and heads over to "Gary" who is covered up in bandages] Gary!
Sadie: The doctor says there's nothing more we can do. It's best to take him home and let nature take its course.
SpongeBob: You're- you're saying that he's... that he might... oh. [Sadie walks away] Nurse? Nurse?! Oh, well, Gary, this looks like it might be...[sniff]... the end. [wails]
Plankton: If I could just have a... [cough cough] Krabby Patty before I go...
SpongeBob: Sure thing, little buddy, sure. [sniffs] Y'know, it's... it's really poignant.
Plankton: What is?
SpongeBob: Well, now that you can talk, we're... we're running out of time to say I love you! [continues wailing and crying]
Plankton: [sighs] Oh, boy...
[Bubbles change the scene to the bus Gary is on]
Tourist: So, once again, we'd like to thank you for choosing Club Shell, and we hope to see you again real soon.
SpongeBob: [Carrying "Gary"] Just a little further, Gare-Bare.
Gary: [Looks out window]
Plankton: Yes!
[Gary pulls busline angrily and slithers over to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [Puts "Gary" down on the floor next to the grill] Buddy, you just stay right here, and Daddy's gonna go get the secret formula and whip you up the best batch that we ever whipped up. Be right back, Gare-Bear. [Walks away gloomily]
Plankton: Yes, SpongeFool, come right back with your complete undoing and victory will be mine!
[Gary slithers to Plankton angrily and growls at him]
Plankton: Mommy? Hey, wait!
[Gary beats Plankton up, while Mr. Krabs hears this, and he sees Plankton running out the door] 
Mr. Krabs: Plankton? [Finds out Gary beat him out of the restaurant and has an idea. Bubbles change the scene. Gary is at the Krusty Krab door letting people in, then Plankton, in a costume, comes up to Gary]
Plankton: Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare. [Gary Growls] Whoa, there, fido! [screams and runs away] I'm going! I'm going already!
SpongeBob: Wow, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer, huh, Mr. Krabs? Really earning his pay.
Mr. Krabs: Well, he takes after you, boy. [surprised] Pay?!


SpongeBob: [putting the meat on the patty] Easy... [takes all the condiments and throws them in the air. They all land nicely stacked on top of the patty] Perfection!
Squidward: Is number 5's order ready yet, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now. [sniffles, starts to tear] You grew up so fast, I... [Squidward looks bored] Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this. [gives the order to Squidward] Just take it Squidward, take it away. [cries]
Squidward: Oh, brother. [into microphone] Number 5. Number 5!
SpongeBob: [shows a slip with the number 5 on it] That's me! [takes Krabby Patty and eats it] Mmm. My compliments to the chef! [laughs himself into the kitchen, where he notices something] Hello, what's this? [gets close to the window of the door where his eyes and Mr. Krabs' eyes meet]
Mr. Krabs: Come out here, boy.
SpongeBob: [walks outside] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob and drags him under the dumpster] Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole.
SpongeBob: [whispering] What's a hidey-hole?
Mr. Krabs: It's where I hide me treasure. [pushes the dumpster aside and throws SpongeBob out of the hole] Catch! [throws a treasure chest at SpongeBob] Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!
SpongeBob: What's in this thing? Treasure?
Mr. Krabs: A treasure trove of sorts. It's me memory chest from my years in the navy.
SpongeBob: Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Well, my navy buddies and I are having a reunion. And I wanted to wear me old uniform. [opens chest]
SpongeBob: Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh! [takes out a tattoo] It's me first tattoo.
SpongeBob: Neat.
Mr. Krabs: And this is me 'Manly Toughness Trophy'. [shows a trophy with an arm at the top]
SpongeBob: How'd you win that?
Mr. Krabs: By being the toughest of the tough!
SpongeBob: Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys? [pointing to a picture with 5 sailors in it]
Mr. Krabs: Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's "'Ol Iron Eye", [shows guy with iron for an eye], and "Mutton Chop", [shows guy holding a wrench], me, [shows Mr. Krabs in a navy suit], "Torpedo Belly", [shows big guy with torpedo in his belly], and "Lockjaw Jones". [shows guy with a big jaw &amp; leaning on an anchor]
SpongeBob: Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Of course! I was called "Armor Abs Krabs".
SpongeBob: You were?
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: Well, I guess you were thinner back then.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, really? [takes his navy suit] This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds. [rips navy suit while trying to put it on] Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch.
SpongeBob: You want me to punch you in the stomach?
Mr. Krabs: Not in the stomach! In me armor abs!
SpongeBob: [punches Mr Krabs in the abs, but his arm breaks into little pieces] wow, my entire arm disintegrated.
Mr. Krabs: I still got it. Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape. And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir! [opens kitchen door] Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around! [point to potatoes] To battle stations. [pouring fries into the grease fryer] All hands on deck! [puts 10 Krabby Patties on the grill] Set course for full flavor. [turns knob on stove to the right] Ketchup and mustard off the port bow. [stepping on ketchup and mustard containers] One Krabby Patty ready to set sail. [holding krabby patty up]
Mr. Krabs: No! [SpongeBob drops his Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs. [knocks once on Mr. Krabs door and it opens] Hello? Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs is shown head down on his desk] You alright? Are you sleepy? [pokes Mr. Krabs body knocking it to the floor, revealing an empty shell] Mr. Krabs! [sniffs his arm] I don't smell his pulse. [in the background, a fleshy and pink Mr. Krabs rushes past SpongeBob] What's that? [figure is behind a barrel] Is somebody there?
Mr. Krabs: Don't look at me! Leave me be!
SpongeBob: [throws barrel away] You're alive! And naked...
Mr. Krabs: [crying] It's true. I've molted.
SpongeBob: What's molted?
Mr. Krabs: It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!
SpongeBob: Wow.
Mr. Krabs: 'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this. All pink and soft and unmanly. I'm all flab and no ab! [sobs]
SpongeBob: Barnacles!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Who cares how silly, pink &amp; fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp &amp; soft you are. How... [Mr. Krabs cries] ...oops.
Mr. Krabs: I can't go anywhere ever again. Stupid, no good... [kicks shell into the wall which ricochets back at SpongeBob. He screams. The shell lands on his hand and he runs around, screaming. Then he falls over and goes in his shell]
SpongeBob: Wow, it sure is dark in here. [pokes head through the shell] Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're a genius.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not about what's on the outside. It's what's on the in...
Mr. Krabs: No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me.
SpongeBob: I get to be a navy buddy?
Mr. Krabs: Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality.
SpongeBob: Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, show me what you got.
SpongeBob: [pulls nose out to look like Mr. Krabs' then imitates his voice] Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money.
Mr. Krabs: Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad.
SpongeBob: I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.
Mr. Krabs: That's me. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story. [pulls covers over the wallet] Goodnight, wallety. [kisses the wallet]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, okay, I get the point.
SpongeBob: Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That'll do, SpongeBob.
[At the reunion]
SpongeBob: Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them! [at the reunion, a tough man is shown lifting Nancy on a treasure chest]
Mr. Krabs: [hiding in a coral plant] No you're not. Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I won't let you down, sir.
Mutton Chop: Armor Abs Krabs. Come join your navy buddies in a toast.
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Coming! [runs over to the table]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what have I done?
SpongeBob: Okay, boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here.
Mr. Krabs: I've created a monster.
Lockjaw Jones: Here's some grog. You still like pineapple, right?
SpongeBob: Like pineapple? I live in one. [everyone laughs]
Torpedo Belly: That Ol' Krabs is manly as ever.
Mr. Krabs: I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off.
Mutton Chop: Hey, Armor Abs, Ol' Iron Eye here has been itching to punch your legendary gut.
SpongeBob: Well, if you think you're man enough.
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh, this could be bad.
SpongeBob: Fire the torpedoes. [Iron Eye punches SpongeBob. He bounces around in the shell then comes up dizzy]
Mutton Chop: What do you say, Krabs? Just like old times. [SpongeBob spits out a tooth]
Lockjaw Jones: A tooth.
[SpongeBob spits out two more teeth]
Torpedo Belly: Teeth. Now, that's manly.
[SpongeBob coughs out his skeleton and everyone gasps then cheers]
Mr. Krabs: He did it.
Captain: Alright, me swabbys, it's time to award the trophy of manly toughness. To a man who's toughness has stewed the test of time. And that man is: Eugene Armor Abs Krabs! Come up here , Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: This is the best night of my life. Me naval buddies still think I'm manly. And I didn't have to shed myself.
Naval Buddies: Armor Abs! Armor Abs! Armor Abs!
SpongeBob: Thanks for the trophy, everybody. [laughs]
Naval Buddies: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
SpongeBob: I...uhh...
Mr. Krabs: Say something.
SpongeBob: Let me spin you a manly yarn.
Mr. Krabs: 'Atta boy.
SpongeBob: So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields.
Mr. Krabs: I'm doomed.
SpongeBob: Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble...
Mutton Chop: Did he say Jellyfish Fields?
Iron Eye: Blowing bubbles?
Mutton Chop: Uhh, what were you doing in Jellyfish Fields?
SpongeBob: Why, jellyfishing, of course.
Naval Buddies: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Phone call for Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob is confused] [quietly yelling] Get off the stage.
SpongeBob: Oh, well, I gotta go. Uhh, thanks. [runs off the stage]
Torpedo Belly: Where do you think you're going? Everybody knows there's two things Ol' Armor Abs Krabs would never do.
Mr. Krabs: Oh no.
Lockjaw Jones: Number one, is spend a penny.
Torpedo Belly: And the other one, is leave without giving Ol' Torpedo Belly one of your world famous steely belly butts. Haha
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean, [Mr. Krabs' voice] arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all.
Mr. Krabs: I can't watch. [SpongeBob &amp; Torpedo Belly butt each other in the belly and sends SpongeBob flying]
Torpedo Belly: Armor Abs? [SpongeBob flies into a sign and then back into Torpedo Belly breaking the shell. SpongeBob is revealed and everyone gets angry]
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville, boys, uhh, men.
Mr. Krabs: No! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am. [everyone gasps] Alright, lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable. [cries] But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: None taken, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, lad, let's go home.
Mutton Chop: Wait a minute! You've forgotten something. [hands trophy to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: I don't understand.
Mutton Chop: Admitting you lost your shell is the toughest thing I've ever seen. And, uhh, I have a confession. [rips off sideburns] These are fake! [SpongeBob &amp; Mr. Krabs gasp]
Torpedo Belly: Over here.
Mr. Krabs: You, too, Torpedo Belly?
Torpedo Belly: Actually, I had my torpedo removed long ago.
Lockjaw Jones: And these aren't the same choppers that I had in the navy.
Iron Eye: My iron eye is actually made of Formica. [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back. [both laugh]


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs takes the paper containing the secret formula out of the bottle and looks at it. He writes down stuff on another piece of paper and puts the formula back in the bottle.]
Mr. Krabs: [gives SpongeBob the paper] Alright, take this, boy-o. And study it very carefully.
SpongeBob: [looks at the paper] Right! Oh-ho! Ha. Mr. Krabs. [shows a drawing of money wearing a bikini and a whistle sound effect]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Not that side! [turns paper around]
SpongeBob: [studies the paper] Oh. Huh. A shopping list?
Mr. Krabs: We're running low on secret ingredients. I need you to go shopping.
[As Mr. Krabs talks to SpongeBob, the Chum Bucket is hearing the conversation outside through a giant stethoscope while Plankton is listening through headphones attached to a monitor.]
Mr. Krabs: But be careful not to lose the list. If you-know-who gets his hands on it, he'll know what goes into the Krabby Patty. You know where that leads. Total apocalypse!
[Plankton's monitor shows an atomic explosion on the screen.]
Plankton: More like "funpocalypse"! [cackles] I'll just follow that yellow nitwit and the secret ingredients will be mine!
[Suddenly, the monitor begins to hear SpongeBob's laughter. The screen shows the image of SpongeBob's face laughing and Plankton screams as it electrocutes him through the headphones. The monitor short-circuits and explodes. The scene changes to SpongeBob walking down the street with the shopping list.]
SpongeBob: ♪Shopping spree! That's for me! A list of goodies from the sea! Shopping spree! That's for me! A list of goodies from the sea! Shopping spree! That's for me! A list of goodies from the sea!♪
[As SpongeBob sings and dances down the street, Plankton, who was hiding in a pedestrian's face, follows. SpongeBob dances over Fred and his boat. Plankton hides in the boat's wheel, peeks out and follows. Plankton is on the rooftop of a nearby building. He shoots a grappling hook down and ties it to a pipe. He swings down and goes to reach for the list, but he misses when SpongeBob goes in a different direction. Plankton crashes into a stop sign and falls flat on the ground. He goes to get up but gets stepped on by SpongeBob's shoe. He screams in agony as he continuously gets stepped on by SpongeBob. The scene changes to SpongeBob looking at the list as he walks.]
SpongeBob: Wow. The stuff on this shopping list is pretty exotic. I'm not gonna find any of this at Barg'N-Mart.
[SpongeBob bumps into an acorn-shaped submarine Sandy is working on and spins over to Sandy.]
Sandy: [removes her wielding mask] Whatcha got there, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [still spinning] Hold on. [stops spinning and shows Sandy the shopping list as he whispers] Something super secret.
[Plankton, who is disguised as the anchor design on SpongeBob's Krusty Krab hat, leans over and listens.]
Sandy: [looks at the paper] Yeah. I guess you'd want to keep this secret. [shows the drawing of money wearing a bikini from before]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not that side. [turns paper around to show the shopping list]
Sandy: Holy moly! You're gonna have to go to tarnation and back to get all these things.
SpongeBob: Well, what do I do?
Sandy: Ah, no worries. I just souped up old Matilda here.
[SpongeBob rubs Sandy's submarine and it revs up.]
Sandy: I think she likes ya.
[SpongeBob blushes and giggles with shyness. The scene changes inside the submarine. Sandy is setting up the coordinates for the locations of the items on the list. Plankton hops off of SpongeBob's hat and hides in the tool box. SpongeBob begins to sweat and gasp since the submarine has no water in it. SpongeBob's body then dries up.]
SpongeBob: [wheezes] Sandy, does it seem a little dry in here? [his finger snaps]
Sandy: Huh? Oh, possum pits! How could I forget? [puts on her helmet]
[Sandy opens the hatch and lets water into the submarine. SpongeBob's body soaks up and SpongeBob starts breathing again.]
SpongeBob: [gasps and sighs] Thanks.
Sandy: Buckle up!
[Sandy and SpongeBob buckle their seatbelts. Sandy activates the submarine and it swims off away from the treedome. The submarine swam too fast that it knocked over some rocks. SpongeBob and Sandy's faces flatten as the submarine speeds up. The tool box slides back with Plankton inside.]
Plankton: [hits his head against the interior of the tool box] Ow! What? [screams as incoming tools fly straight at him]
[Plankton dodges the incoming tools until they stopped.]
Plankton: Whew! [screams as an incoming hammer squishes him, leaving him crushed]
[The scene changes to Sandy flying her submarine over snowy mountains. There, a snowman as well as tombstones of Dirty Dan and Pinhead Larry are shown.]
SpongeBob: The first item on Mr. Krabs' list is...hair from a yeti crab?
Sandy: Well, that hairy hermit dwells right here on this mountain top.
[Sandy parks her submarine near the opening of the yeti crab's cave. SpongeBob and Sandy exit the submarine and enter the cave. They find the yeti crab sound asleep on a rock.]
Sandy: [gasps] Look, there he is!
[SpongeBob and Sandy tip-toe quietly towards the yeti crab. Sandy sneaks over, takes out a pair of scissors, pulls the blanket back, and clips some of the hair off the yeti crab's butt.]
Sandy: [gives the hair to SpongeBob and whispers] He lives alone. He'll never know it's gone.
[Plankton, who is clinging on a stalactite, watches from above as SpongeBob and Sandy leave the cave.]
Plankton: Krabs puts yeti hair in the Krabby Patties? Ew! Why didn't I think of that?
[The yeti crab shivers and pulls the cover back before going back to sleep. Plankton lowers himself down and prepares to mow the hair off the yeti crab's head with his lawn mower. This, however, wakes up the yeti crab and he roars at Plankton. He shakes Plankton off and sees his head bald. Plankton gets up and sees the yeti crab's shadow looming over him.]
Plankton: Uh-oh! [gets bashed and flattened by the yeti crab's rolling pin] Ow! Uh, ah, ooh, ah, oh, hey!
[Plankton is completely flat like a piece of paper. The yeti crab then folds Plankton into a little paper hat to cover his bald spot.]
Plankton: Could've been worse. Could've been a ten gallon hat.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Sandy flying over seaweed and jellyfish float by.]
SpongeBob: The next item is milk from a giant fangtooth fish.
Sandy: [drives the submarine down the abyss] The deep ocean floor is the only place it inhabits. Keep an eye out.
[SpongeBob sticks his eye through the submarine's telescope and sees a giant green fangtooth fish in front of them.]
SpongeBob: I found it! [pulls his eye back through the telescope] But how do we milk it?
Sandy: We'll have to distract her first. Deploy kibble!
[Sandy flips the switch and pours food down for the fangtooth fish to eat. The fangtooth fish kneels down and starts eating the food. SpongeBob and Sandy exit the submarine and rush over to the fangtooth fish's udder.]
SpongeBob: Is one udder better than another udder?
Sandy: We'll just have to milk them all! [gives SpongeBob a bucket]
[Sandy pulls up a stool, cracks her hands, and begins the milking process. Sandy milks some of the milk in the bucket and fills SpongeBob up with the milk. She pulls out a milking device and sticks it onto SpongeBob to spew the milk into the bucket. She pulls the device off of SpongeBob and puts it away.]
Sandy: Whoa, nelly! Good girl.
[The fangtooth fish moos like a cow and eats her food while SpongeBob and Sandy leave with the milk. Plankton, who was hiding behind some coral, giggles and flies over to the fangtooth fish's udder. He attempts to milk the milk out, but it wouldn't work since it was too big for him to pull.]
Plankton: Huh? Don't you run dry on me, baby! [punches the udder]
[Plankton's punching gets the fangtooth fish's attention.]
Plankton: [continues punching the udder] Come on! Flow already!
Female Fangtooth Fish: [sees Plankton] Huh? [growls]
Plankton: Uh, nice fishy-fishy. I—I don't suppose you like chumsicles. [pulls out a chumsicle and laughs nervously]
[The fangtooth fish swaps the chumsicle away and Plankton runs for his life. The fangtooth fish fires the milk from her udder and sprays it onto Plankton. Plankton takes out a bucket and gets some of the milk.]
Plankton: [giggles] Yeah! Thanks for the fish milk, Ugly! [laughs as he attempts to leave, but ends up getting swallowed by a orange male fangtooth fish]
Male Fangtooth Fish: You're not ugly, darling. You've got character.
Female Fangtooth Fish: Aww! [rubs the male fangtooth fish's chin and giggles]
Plankton: [shakes the bucket off while inside the male fangtooth fish's mouth] Oh, shrimp! Guess I'll have to take the long walk to the back exit. [goes down the male fangtooth fish's throat]]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Sandy flying the submarine to the Flying Dutchman's ghost ship.]
Sandy: SpongeBob, what are we doing here? The Flying Dutchman's about as welcoming as an outhouse breeze!
SpongeBob: It's on the list. [pulls out the list and points to the last item] See? Ghost dandruff.
[SpongeBob and Sandy hear the Flying Dutchman laughing. The scene goes to the Flying Dutchman looking at himself in the mirror.]
Flying Dutchman: [laughing] With my face, I can say anything and make it sound scary! [makes a scary face in the mirror and laughs] One large skinny pumpkin latte with soy milk, please? [laughs and forms a chainsaw on his face]
[SpongeBob and Sandy sneak into the Dutchman's ship through an open window. Sandy throws a lasso and ties it up to the ceiling. SpongeBob and Sandy climb up while the Flying Dutchman continues to admire himself in the mirror.]
Flying Dutchman: [forms a more hideous face] Forty percent chance of rain tonight as we head into the weekend. [shakes his head and laughs]
[SpongeBob and Sandy tip-toe quietly above the Flying Dutchman. They lower themselves down to where the Dutchman is having dandruff. Sandy brushes the dandruff into SpongeBob's bucket with her tail.]
SpongeBob: [whispers] Got it!
[SpongeBob and Sandy quickly climb back up and quietly leave. Plankton sneaks into through the hole on the floor. He throws the grappling hook and climbs up the Dutchman's back. He takes out a little vacuum and goes to suck the dandruff. But the vacuum accidentally sucks up the Dutchman's hair and it pulls really hard, causing the Flying Dutchman to feel pain.]
Flying Dutchman: Ah! Ow! Uh! What the?! [sees Plankton and grabs him] How dare you steal my dandruff! I've been drying me scalp for centuries in order to achieve the perfect dermatitis flakes! [points to his scalp with dry flakes on it]
Plankton: [hold up dandruff shampoo] Maybe some skull and shoulders would help?
[The Flying Dutchman growls angrily and blasts Plankton out of his ship with his powers. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Sandy flying over Jellyfish Fields with all of the items they've obtained from the list. Sandy is brushing the dandruff off her tail.]
SpongeBob: Well, we got everything on the list. [pulls up the bag of ingredients and spins the seat] Oh, Mr. Krabs will be so proud of me!
Sandy: I hope so, because that's the craziest group of ingredients I ever—Whoa!
[Suddenly, the alarm blares and the submarine shakes. It appears that Plankton is having the Chum Bucket plunge SpongeBob and Sandy out of the submarine. Plankton pops out.]
Plankton: There is one more thing I needed to get on my shopping list. Everything! [cackles] Thanks for doing it for me! So long, chumps!
[The Chum Bucket flings SpongeBob and Sandy away, grabs the submarine, takes it inside and pulls out the bag of ingredients.]
Plankton: [laughs evilly] At last! The Krabby Patty secret ingredients are in my hands!
[SpongeBob and Sandy land in a bush.]
SpongeBob: Aw, my ingredients!
Sandy: [cries] My submarine!
Yeti Crab: [appears next to them and growls] My hair!
[SpongeBob and Sandy scream in terror.]
French Narrator: Later…
[The scene changes back to the Krusty Krab. The yeti crab walks to the restaurant with a brown wig. He lets SpongeBob and Sandy off his back.]
Yeti Crab: Thanks for the wig.
Sandy: No problem! [sighs as she sees her tail completely shaved off] It'll grow back.
[The yeti crab turns and leaves.]
SpongeBob: And you even had enough to cover his buns. [points to the yeti crab's butt all covered up with Sandy's fur]
[Mr. Krabs is bathing in a tub of money in the restaurant. SpongeBob and Sandy enter the restaurant and sulk over to Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs gasps and hides in the tub] I got all the secret ingredients on your list, but Plankton stole them all! I made the apocalypse!
[SpongeBob cries a fountain of tears and spray them all over the restaurant, which hits Mr. Krabs. Sandy gets drenched on by the tears and activates the windshield wipers on her helmet.]
Mr. Krabs: [plugs SpongeBob's mouth with a cork] Now, now, son. You didn't make the apocalypse. I couldn't afford to have Plankton following me while I was getting the real ingredients at the Barg'N-Mart, could I?
[Mr. Krabs pushes the button on the table Fred is eating on and it flips over showing a shopping cart containing the real Krabby Patty ingredients.]
Fred: [screams] My leg!
SpongeBob: So, my list was a fake? So, no apocalypse?
Mr. Krabs: No apocalypse.
SpongeBob: I saved the world! [laughs and dances around the restaurant while Sandy glares angrily at Mr. Krabs] No apocalypse! No apocalypse! No apocalypse! No apocalypse!
Mr. Krabs: Let's not go too far.
Sandy: [rolls up her sleeves] You mean you sent my best friend on a dangerous wild goose chase just so you could go shopping?! [backs Mr. Krabs into his office] Excuse us, SpongeBob. [closes the door while wearing her karate glove] This is for my tail!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, Sandy, I was—
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops Mr. Krabs really hard] This is for almost getting us killed!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, Sandy!
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops Mr. Krabs really hard again and comes out with a bag of money] And this is for my submarine, Matilda!
[Mr. Krabs come out and is completely beaten up.]
Sandy: [kicks the plank Mr. Krabs is standing on] Hi-yah! Hi-yah! [karate chops Mr. Krabs and sends him flying through the roof]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I guess I had that coming.
[Meanwhile, at the Chum Bucket, Plankton is fixing up a batch of Krabby Patties with the fake ingredients.]
Plankton: Can you believe it, Karen? After all these years, the secret ingredients are finally here! And the final ingredient: [pulls out a bucket of ghost dandruff from the bag] ghost dandruff!
Karen: [backs away] I wouldn't add that last one.
Plankton: [adds ghost dandruff to the batch] Ha, ha! I can't wait to see the look on Krabs' face!
[Plankton stirs the fake ingredients all together. Then all of a sudden, the Chum Bucket explodes and sends Plankton flying in the sky.]
Plankton: [screams until he sees Mr. Krabs] Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton.


Patrick: [reading a comic book. Screams] No, no! [starts crying then stops] Yay! [laughs]
Nerd: Well, if only Inaudible Lad were here right now.
Patrick: Oh. [eats comic book] Nothing satisfies like a good story.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Patrick with a stack of comic books] Are ya ready to go, Patrick?
Patrick: [screams] Get back, I wasn't going to eat all of you!
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me!
Patrick: Sponge-- [burps and a piece of paper lands into SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Ew, what's this?
Patrick: [takes the piece of paper] Well, whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it! [inspects the piece of paper and gasps] SpongeBob, what do all these words say?
SpongeBob: It's an ad. [talks in an announcer tone] Dear Comic Book Reader.
Patrick: That's me!
SpongeBob: [continues as announcer] Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?
Patrick: I never thought about anything!
SpongeBob: [continues] Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit! [uses regular tone of voice again] Can we go now? My arms are getting tired.
Patrick: I want to send in a poem, and everyone would love it, and I would be a star!
SpongeBob: You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all! [makes a disgusted face] Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100. [SpongeBob's wallet falls out of his and struggles to pick it up] Patrick, could you get my wallet? [Patrick picks up SpongeBob's wallet]
Patrick: Hey, look. [pulls out $100 bill from wallet] I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my comic book money!
Patrick: [indignant] It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Patrick. [the comic book store clerk shows up]
Comic Book Store Clerk: Hey, you going to pay for those comics? [SpongeBob's arms fall off with the comics]
SpongeBob: No. [gets kicked out] Ow! Can I have my arms back? [cut to SpongeBob's house]
Patrick: I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob, for I am about to erupt with a masterpiece. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Good luck. [doorbell rings] Coming-- [Patrick slams door against SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work? [cut to Patrick at the desk]
Patrick: [hovering the pencil over the paper] SpongeBob! This pencil is broken! Why won't it make words?
SpongeBob: You have to think of the words yourself. [walks away with the laundry]
Patrick: I think I wrote a poem once. [flashback to Patrick's childhood]
Young Patrick: A Poem, by Patrick Star. Roses are blue, violets are red, I have to go to the bathroom. [eats his poem and then burps and takes a bow]
Gym Teacher: How many times do I gotta tell ya, this is gym class! [blows whistle and everyone starts throwing dodgeballs at Patrick, who takes cover]
Patrick: [present time] Ohh, dodgeballs.
SpongeBob: [shadow figure of himself holding a dodgeball and wearing an evil grin] Oh, Patrick!
Patrick: [screams] Don't hit me with a dodgeball! [hides under the desk and SpongeBob turns on the lights and Gary pops out of his shell]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?
Patrick: I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once.
SpongeBob: [gets shocked] No!
Patrick: Wait! There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball! [starts crying] Whyyyyyy?! [dramatic music plays]
SpongeBob: [stops Gary's record player] You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?
Patrick: I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs.
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?
Gary: [saying no suspiciously] Meow.
Patrick: If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain.
SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window. [cut to SpongeBob's house with an opened window with Patrick struggling to write the poem]
Patrick: [tapping his head with the pencil] Come on, you stupid brain! work! [Patrick's brain starts working and smoke comes out] It's working! [struggling as he starts writing]
SpongeBob: [knocking] Patrick, don't strain yourself. [Patrick continues struggling as Squidward opens the window]
Squidward: Now, what's going on? [looks disgusted] What is that horrible smell? [SpongeBob comes out] Is Patrick thinking again?
Patrick: I'm making art!
Squidward: Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died.
Patrick: That's the creative process at work! [Squidward closes the window] Ready to go to the post office? [shows a letter with his poem in it] I need to mail in my masterpiece.
Narrator: The next day... [cut to Bigshot Records]

SpongeBob: I don't see any dodgeballs here buddy. Just an artist and his work.
Patrick: Yeah! And me too! Now sit down and get comfortable.
SpongeBob: [sits on his arm chair, while Patrick pushes a big stereo in front of him] Uh, Patrick?
Patrick: [on top of the stereo] SpongeBob SquarePants! Are you ready to rock?! Whooo! [SpongeBob screams as Patrick lands on the chair and turns on the music]
SpongeBob: [covering his ears] It's really loud!
Patrick: You need it louder? Okay!
Lead singer: [singing Patrick's poem] ♪Twinkle, twinkle, Patrick Star. I made myself a sandwich. My mommy named it Fred. It tastes like beans and bacon. And smells like it's been dead. Writing stuff is hard so I use a pointy pencil. Pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, point. P.U., what's that horrible smell?♪

Patrick: That was awesome! Did you like it or did you really, really like it? Give me your completely honest opinion of how great it was.
SpongeBob: [looking like he wants to insult it] Oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard!
Patrick: Do you really think so?
SpongeBob: We need to get that song on the radio!
Patrick: Then let's go right now, come on! [takes SpongeBob's arm off]
SpongeBob: Darn, I just got that arm back. [cut to the radio station where SpongeBob and Patrick are going to put the song on the radio]
Patrick: I can't wait to see look on their face once they hear this. [they go inside and employee screams and kicks them out and closes the door]
SpongeBob: Did you see the look on his face?
Patrick: Yeah. Did you see his ears?
SpongeBob: I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio?
Patrick: What record? [they see the antenna]
SpongeBob: I got an idea! [cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof. Wind howls as SpongeBob and Patrick shiver] We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna.
Patrick: Carry me?
SpongeBob: Huh? Patrick-- [Patrick lands on top of SpongeBob and SpongeBob picks him up, struggling]
Patrick: Tally ho! Mush! Onward and upward! [SpongeBob is struggling to get to the top of the antenna] Faster, SpongeBob! Faster! [Patrick sees a satellite go by. They get to the top of the antenna. Patrick stands on SpongeBob's face, takes out his record player and then puts it on the top of the antenna, the record player wobbles and falls off and Patrick catches it] Oh! Hmm-- this record won't stay put.
SpongeBob: [mumbling inaudibly]
Patrick: Good idea. [takes out bubble gum and throws it in his mouth and chews on it, while making noises and he blows a bubble]
SpongeBob: [mumbling impatiently.] [Bubble pops and sticks to Patrick's mouth]
Patrick: Oh, yeah. I forgot. [pulls gum off and sticks it to the bottom of the record player and puts it on the top of the antenna and turns on the music. Ralph is walking past a radio in a store]

Fred: Let's get 'em, boys! [they start chasing them. SpongeBob &amp; Patrick found a cure. they beat them up but SpongeBob and Patrick play with instruments wildly. Patrick plays with a guitar, while SpongeBob plays with a chainsaw and a tambourine. They pant heavily while they got rid of the mob]

[Episode opens on a shot of the Chum Bucket. The camera then cuts to interior of Plankton's lab. Karen is attached to the wall in this episode. The camera zooms in on a small entrance with a button, outlet, and miniature coat hanger by it. The panel covering the entrance slides up, revealing an exhausted Plankton wearing a hat and carrying a briefcase. He enters the Chum Bucket and the panel automatically closes]
Plankton: [sighs. Plankton walks over to the coat hanger, about to hang his hat]
Karen: [speaking right when Plankton grabs his hat, causing him to grow frustrated] Plankton, is that you? Welcome home, honey.
Plankton: [mutters to himself as he hangs up his hat and puts down his briefcase. When Plankton removes his hat, a green odor is shown to be coming from him. It begins approaching three holes in the ceiling right above Karen's monitor]
Karen: How was your day? [smells the odor through the holes in the ceiling and coughs as an alarm sounds] Dear Neptune, Plankton! [closes the holes in the ceiling] What is that smell?!?
Plankton: The aroma you speak of, Karen, my computer wife, is the stench of failure.
[The word "FAILURE" comes out of Plankton, along with the continuous odor]
Stench: [in a whispering tone] Failure.
Plankton: And now, the smell of defeat so deeply penetrates my soul that my very skin is permeated with its foul stench. [sighs and starts walking away, then pauses and speaks in a sarcastic tone] Thanks for asking. [starts walking away again] 
Karen: Well, it smells horrible! You're not coming in here smelling like that! [grabs Plankton with one of her robotic arms]
Plankton: Hey! What are you—?
[Karen holds Plankton up to an air duct which vacuums off his skin, leaving him looking like he normally does, except his color is pink and he's in his underwear. Plankton looks at himself and, seeing he's naked, screams an unusually high-pitched scream and covers himself. Karen begins moving Plankton somewhere else]
Plankton: Stop that at once! You—!
[Karen puts Plankton into a bucket of water which rests next to a mop, creating a large splash and several bubbles. She takes him out]
Plankton: [gasps for water] I command you to—!
[Plankton's words are made incomprehensible when Karen puts him back in the bucket a second time. She takes Plankton out again and, with another robotic arm of hers, holds up a scrub brush]
Plankton: [moves his legs around like he's trying to run away] Oh, no!
[Karen scrubs Plankton with the brush and puts him in the bucket of water a third time. When she takes him out once again, she blows a hair dryer at Plankton while he screams. She grabs a new pair of skin for Plankton which is on a rack among other pairs and puts it on him while he sits on a stool. Karen holds up a mirror for Plankton and buffs him up with pink powder, creating a large cloud of dust which blocks the view of the camera. When the dust clears, Plankton is clean and has a SpongeBob-like look on his face]
Karen: There you go. Now. don't you feel better?
Plankton: [looks in the mirror] Although I do look ravishing, it's not enough to mask the ugliness I feel inside.
Karen: Did I miss a spot? [scrubs the inside of his mouth with the scrub brush. Plankton is very frustrated now, and begins to grow veins on himself]
Karen: Don't blow a gasket, dear. Today's a special day!
Plankton: [as his veins disappear] Special day?
Karen: Yes. We're celebrating your biggest accomplishment ever!
Plankton: [smiles] Really? I accomplished something? What is it?
Karen: It has something with you asking a certain someone to spend the rest of her life with you.
Plankton: [confused] What?
[Cut to shot of Karen]
Karen: [sighs a quick sigh and, while showing a gold ring on her robotic hand, speaks a little faster] We each wear rings in memory of this moment.
[Cut to shot of Plankton looking at a gold ring that he's wearing around his arm]
Plankton: [moves his arm behind his back and back in front of him, making the ring disappear] Enough with the riddles, woman! Just tell me what this proud moment in my life is!
Karen: Oh, you selfish, green twit! It's our wedding anniversary!
Plankton: [disappointed] Oh, that. [sarcastically rolls around an imaginary noise maker with his finger] Yippee. [walks away]
Karen: [sobs] You forgot! And I got you the perfect gift! [holds out a bottle with a piece of paper and a pink bow tied around it inside]
Plankton: [screeches to a halt and turns around, seeing his gift] The Krabby Patty Formula?!? [immediately perks up, jumps up onto the bottle and gives it two kisses] How did you get it?!?
Karen: First I went to the Krusty Krab...
[Camera cuts to a shot of the ordering area of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is in the boat. Karen, who is for some reason portable now, rolls on her wheels in front of it.]
Karen: [in flashback] One Krabby Patty, please.
[Squidward holds out a plate with a Krabby Patty on it and Karen picks it up. She pushes what she can of it into a slot on the side of her. Displayed on her screen are the words "Secret Formula" and a picture of Krabby Patty. She sucks in the rest of the Krabby Patty, prints out a piece of paper with the formula on it, and puts it in a bottle]
Karen: [in flashback] Thank you. [rolls away]
Squidward: [in flashback] Whatever.
[The camera fades back to Plankton still kissing the bottle with the formula in it]
Plankton: What? Sorry. I wasn't listening. [jumps down holding the formula] Well, you can tell me later. [begins to walk away with it]
Karen: [as she takes away the bottle with the formula in it to Plankton] You're not getting this until you get me a gift.
Plankton: [groans]
Karen: From your heart.
[Plankton sighs and walks away to the entrance seen in the beginning of the episode. The door automatically opens, thus making its placement seem rather pointless. He grabs his hat from the coat hanger, gives Karen one last look, and leaves the Chum Bucket. Bubble into a shot of SpongeBob and Squidward walking together]
SpongeBob: And that's the story of how I got my head stuck in the fry vat. [Changes expression as if he notices something]
Squidward: That story gets better every time you tell it, SpongeBo—
SpongeBob: [lifting his hands up and knocking Squidward to the ground] Hold on! Did you hear that? It sounds like...
[Plankton groans]
SpongeBob: ...despair.
Squidward: That was probably me.
SpongeBob: No. No. Not bitterness. Despair. And it's coming from over... [turns around and points] this way. [goes down on the ground and sniffs like a dog, finding Plankton groaning] Plankton! What's wrong, Plankton?
Plankton: Wha—? SpongeBob? Ah...there's nothing wrong. Don't worry. [crying] I'm...fine.
SpongeBob: Come on. Tell your Uncle SpongeBob.
Plankton: Oh, it's nothing. It's just that today is my wedding anniversary.
SpongeBob: Aww...what present did you buy your wife, huh? What'd you buy her?
Plankton: Uh, I didn't buy Karen anything.
SpongeBob: [gasps] We've got a [the words appear on the screen with a heart as he says them] love emergency! [through a megaphone] Attention everyone, we've got a love emergency! [the Bikini Bottomites look at SpongeBob awkwardly] Please stand back. Love emergency. Thank You. Love emergency. Plankton, there's only one thing you need to do. You need to give her a present from [puts his hand over his heart] in here.
Plankton: What? Like a kidney?
SpongeBob: No, from the heart. That's where your love grows.
Plankton: My what?
SpongeBob: Your love.
Plankton: My loove?
SpongeBob: Love.
Plankton: Loop?
SpongeBob: Luh...vuh!
Plankton: Lump.
SpongeBob: Say it with me. L...
Plankton: L...
SpongeBob: ...uhh...
Plankton: ...uhh...
SpongeBob: ...vvvv...
Plankton: [produces lots of spit] ...vvv...
SpongeBob: Llll...uhhh...vuh!
Plankton: Llll...uhhh...vuh!
SpongeBob: That's it! You've taken your first steps into the hall of luh-uv. Now, tell me more about your Karen [bubble to a shot of SpongeBob's House]
SpongeBob: [camera zooms in on SpongeBob's house. The scene changes to SpongeBob's Library] So, what's your favorite thing for you and Karen to do together?
Plankton: Well, we like to take long walks on the beach, and...uh...we talk about our dreams. Uh...our dreams of conquering all of Bikini Bottom and become supreme overlords of all creation [Plankton starts stomping his feet] and to trample our enemies beneath our feet. [laughs evilly] Yeah.
SpongeBob: [as he starts writing it down of a notepad] "Trampling enemies". [talks back to Plankton] Now, tell me about Karen.
Plankton: Well, she's a Mark II Surplus U.N.I.V.A.C. with 256 gigs of RAM, and...uh...there's the cutest mole on her CPU and the way she processes data. Ah ha. Ooh, mama.
SpongeBob: Does she have any hobbies?
Plankton: Uh...well, uh... [scratches his head] she does make a lot of beeping sounds.
SpongeBob: Interesting. Does she ever go "Ding!"?
Plankton: Now that you mention it, she does go "Ding!". At least once a day.
SpongeBob: [as he writes it down] Ooh. A music lover. I think we have our solution. You need to serenade her.
Plankton: Who? Me? I can't sing.
SpongeBob: Not to worry. When you finish, you'll be as [lowers his voice and sings] golden voiced as me.
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Plankton outside of SpongeBob’s pineapple]
SpongeBob: Repeat after me. ♪Me me me me me me meeeee...♪
Plankton: [clears throat] ♪Me me me me me me me...♪ [clears throat again] ♪...Me me me me me...♪

Plankton: [continued] ♪...me me meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee♪ [Squidward's glass cracks] EEEEEEEEEEEEEE [it shatters and the drink splashes in Squidward's face] EEEEEEEEE [cut to Sandy walking by] EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE [her helmet cracks and shatters] EEEEEEEEEEE....

Plankton: EEEE! Whew!
SpongeBob: [picks up Plankton] Oh, you are ready!
Plankton: Ready? But what do I sing?
SpongeBob: Oh, when the time comes, you'll know. The music she'll love comes from inside.
Plankton: Why are you so obsessed with my internal organs?
[Bubble transitions to SpongeBob and Plankton walking into the Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: This is it, Plankton.
Plankton: I don't think I'm ready.
SpongeBob: Oh, you just got butterflies in your tummy.
Plankton: No, I'm just nervous. I don't know what flying insects have to do with it.
SpongeBob: [laughs and opens the door for Plankton] Get in there and sing, you single-celled Romeo, you. [Plankton walks in] Ah, love.
Plankton: [clears throat] Karen?
Karen: Plankton? I don't see any present.
Plankton: Oh, I have it. It's right here in my kidney... I mean, heart! [clears throat] Me me me meeee...me me meee... [pulls out maracas and starts singing and dancing] ♪Oh, my Karen. Oh, my Karen.

Oh, my computer wife, Karen. I was blinded.♪ [SpongeBob and Patrick put their hands over their eyes] ♪Yes I was blinded. I was blinded by the light of your cathode ray. Oh, I built you.♪ [SpongeBob screws on Patrick's head and Patrick points to it] ♪Yes, I built you. I built you in the, uh....♪ [SpongeBob shows Plankton a picture of a cube with the word "cube" below it] Um... ♪In the shape of a cube. Oh, my Karen. Oh, my Karen. You'll never know how much I love your vacuum tubes♪ [Plankton hugs one of Karen's lightbulbs. Karen smiles, Plankton, SpongeBob, and Patrick bow, and the song ends]
Karen: [sobs] That was so beautiful.
Plankton: You really liked it?
Karen: I loved it! But not as much as I love you, Plankton.
Plankton: I l...l...love you, too! [Bikini Bottom citizens, including SpongeBob, rush in and say "Aw."] So, can I have my present now?
Karen: Of course, my little overlord. Now loading the Krabby Patty Formula...
SpongeBob: They're such a lovely couple. [sniffs before he suddenly gasps] The Krabby Patty Formula?!?
Plankton: Yes! You porous kitchen utensil! By helping me woo my computer wife, you've just doomed the Krusty Krab! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: Oh, no! I've got to stop it before it's too late.
Karen: 45% Loaded.
SpongeBob: [presses several buttons on a computer keyboard] Control, Alt, Delete.
Karen: 55% Loaded.
SpongeBob: [smashes against the computer keyboard] How do ya turn this thing off?!?
Plankton: Get your hand off my wife!
Karen: 65% Loaded.
SpongeBob: [gasps] The plug. [Plankton gasps] Ha! You lose, Plankton.
Plankton: [sarcasticlly] Oh, no. You unplugged the coffee maker, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [gulps] I am so fired.
Karen: Loading Krabby Patty Formula...
Plankton: Here it comes!
Karen: Oh, Plankton, you've made me so happy.
Plankton: That's fantastic. Where's that formula?
Karen: [cries happily with tears of joy] I'm crying. What's going on? [Omatic starts to spark electric sparks]
Plankton: Karen, what's wrong? Have you sprung a leak?
Karen: No. I'm just so happy that I'm crying with tears of joy.
Plankton: But you're shorting out.
Karen: I'm just--. The Krabby...Patty...Formula...loading...completed.
Plankton: Yes!
SpongeBob: No! [The text on the screen blurries and the word "ERROR" appears on the screen]
Plankton: No!
SpongeBob: Yes! I'm saved! Your wife exploded! [puts up his arms with victory] [Plankton makes a serious face] Um...happy anniversary, you guys. [scratches his head, shrugs, and leaves]
Karen: Rebooting... Loading E.M.I.L.P....
Plankton: E.M.I.L.P.? What's E.M.I.L.P.?!?
Karen: Emergency Mother In-Law Program.
Plankton: Oh, no.
E.M.I.L.P.: Plankton, what have you done to my daughter?! You made her cry! You know, she could have been with an ATM! Someone with money! But she chose you! I don't know why!


[Outside the Krusty Krab, a man is knocking on the doors.]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, some guy in a suit wants to come in before we open.
Mr. Krabs: What? Guy in a suit? No, it's a tax collector! [jumps inside SpongeBob’s mouth] Hide us, SpongeBob! [takes the register in with him] Now we'll walk nonchalantly to the rear exit. [Mr. Krabs legs stretch out of SpongeBob, and Mr. Krabs starts walking with them, lifting SpongeBob off the ground. The man knocks on the door again and holds up his business card]
Squidward: He's got a card. [reading business card] R.A. Penny Pincher: Vending Supplies.
Mr. Krabs: What? My machine has arrived?! Oh, let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in! [gets out of SpongeBob, who returns to his normal shape and size]
R.A. Penny Pincher: Bring it in, boys. [a worker brings in the machine, while another worker looks around the place]
Mr. Krabs: That's it, set her down easy.
R.A. Penny Pincher: Here are the keys, Mr. Krabs. [as he hands Mr. Krabs the keys.] Happy vending!
Squidward: What is it?
Mr. Krabs: Only the greatest money maker since the Krabby Patty. [as he reveals the machine covered up with a blanket] Gentlemen, meet Skill Crane!
SpongeBob: Ooh. Skill Crane.
Mr. Krabs: At a quarter a pop, this thing will pay for itself in no time. Which reminds me, step up, boys. First one's free. [takes out two golden coins]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [takes coin]
Squidward: No, thanks, I'll pass.
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, Squidward, you know you want to.
Squidward: [sighs] Okay, if you insist. [takes coin and puts it in his pocket] Thanks.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! In the machine!
Squidward: All right, all right. [puts coin in machine and moves crane] Oh, boy, what fun. [crane almost pulls out a dinosaur]
Skill Crane: You lose!
Squidward: [Suddenly goes berserk] Did you see that, SpongeBob?! I almost got that on my first try!
Mr. Krabs: [Satisfied] My work here is done. [walks away]
Squidward: They don't call me Squidward 'Manual Dexterity' Tentacles for nothing. [moves his tentacles up and down and so does SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Well, why don't I give it a try? [as he pulls out the quarter and puts it in the machine]
Squidward: Haha, good luck. You'll…
Skill Crane: Winner!
SpongeBob: It's a bear! I'm gonna call you Beary.
Squidward: Hmph, beginner's luck. Now it's the master's turn. [puts another coin in and grabs a cat. He mashes a button that says "Grab" but the crane drops the cat]
Skill Crane: Loser!
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, you flipped him over! [as Squidward looks at SpongeBob] That takes an awful amount of skill.
Squidward: Well, thank you for saying so.
SpongeBob: Beary says he's getting lonely. Don't worry, Beary, I'll get you a friend. [enters a coin in Skill Crane]
Squidward: Ha! If you think you're winning that thing again…
Skill Crane: Winner!
SpongeBob: There ya go, Beary. [shows a pink, fat cat with her tongue sticking out]
Squidward: Oh, I loosened that one up for you. You would've never won that without my skill.
SpongeBob: Wow, thanks for your help, Squidward. [walks off]
Squidward: Hmph. I bet I win at this thing the very next time I try. Now all I have to do is… [thought bubble with Mr. Krabs in it appears above Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: [echoing] At a quarter a pop, this thing pays for itself in no time.
Squidward: Ha! I'm not falling for that malarkey. [later, Squidward is behind the register]
SpongeBob: [Skill Crane makes the sound of a winner. SpongeBob walks by with a blue prize animal from Skill Crane] Hey, Squidward. [he sighs as Skill Crane makes the sound of a winner. SpongeBob walks by with a rabbit from Skill Crane] Hey, Squidward. [he sighs again as Skill Crane makes the sound of a winner. SpongeBob walks by with a two-headed pink prize animal from Skill Crane] Hey, Squidward. [laughing from the kitchen] Okay, Mrs. Wiggles, order up. Beary cooked this one all by himself. Oh, he makes me so proud.
Skill Crane: [distinct scratchy voice] Squid…ward. [crane swinging back and forth] Squid…ward.
Squidward: [sighs] Oh, what the… Alright. Let's get this over with.
Mr. Krabs: Need some change? [Squidward hands him the dollar, swipes it out of his hand, and gives him four coins in exchange] There ya are.
Squidward: Gee, thanks.
Mr. Krabs: No, no, Mr. Squidward. Thank you. [Squidward inserts coin in machine]
Skill Crane: You lose.
Mr. Krabs: Need some more change? [gives Squidward more coins but Squidward keeps on losing over and over, dollar after dollar]
Skill Crane: You lose!
Mr. Krabs: Need some change?
Squidward: No...
Mr. Krabs: What? Why?
Squidward: [softly] Because... I'm... all... out... of... [yelling at Mr. Krabs] MONEY!!
Mr. Krabs: All out of…? Hmmm. [later, comes out of his office] Boys, it's payday!
SpongeBob: [gasps] But, Mr. Krabs, today is Monday!
Mr. Krabs: What the... No. It's payday, me boy. Here's your check, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Money, money, money, money, money!
Mr. Krabs: I took the liberty of turning your paycheck... [as he shows Squidward the bag of quarters] ...into quarters. Just in case you wanna... oh, I don't know, do laundry or [as he jiggles the bag] buy a soda or... something.
Squidward: Very funny, Mr. Krabs. If I can't win one of those stupid things with this quarter, I'm walking away.
Narrator: [reading time card] Six hours later…
SpongeBob: [Squidward sitting on ground with empty bag over head] Pardon me, Squidward. SpongeBear, Jr. here wants me to win him a little brother. [Squidward scoots to the side while SpongeBob inserts a coin into the machine]
Skill Crane: You are a winner! [two prizes come out]
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Two in one quarter? That's not fair. [puts in one of the prizes] What's that, clown frown? Oh, you'd rather sit next to lovely lion? [takes the crane and moves the prizes around] There you are, nice and cozy. See ya later, Squidward.
Squidward: [scoots his way into his house and then sits on his couch and sighs] A little mind-numbing television ought to help me forget about that stupid machine. [tries to pick up the remote but every time he tries, he fails because of the crane coming into his mind. He then uses his eye instead to press a button on the remote] Yeeowwww! [he slides off the couch. Now he's in bed] You've had a rough day, Squiddie. But that doesn't mean tomorrow won't be better. [tries to pull his covers but he can't because of the crane coming into his mind] Ooh, phooey! [he shivers for a few seconds, gets up and then tries to pick up the glass of water by his bed but drops it and breaks it] I GOTTA WIN THAT CRANE!! [he runs through his closet door and gets the piggy bank, which cries a teardrop. He then runs to the Krusty Krab. Later, SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab and freaks out at what he sees when he enters] Just once! Please, oh, please, let me win one time!
SpongeBob: Squid, I think you have a problem.
Mr. Krabs: No, he doesn't. You don't listen to him, Squidward. You keep playing until you win! [takes out all the quarters that were put in the machine and pours them into a bucket. A piece of rolled paper drops into the bucket] What's this?
Squidward: The deed to my house.
Mr. Krabs: Okey-dokey, then. Carry on.
Squidward: [bawling] If I can just win once, I'd never play again! [wailing]
SpongeBob: Hey, you want me to tell you the secret of how to win on this machine?
Squidward: [gasps] SpongeBob! There's a secret?!?!
SpongeBob: Mmhmm.
Squidward: Tell... me... [as his eyes get bigger] the... secret.
SpongeBob: Are you ready to be a winner?
Squidward: Yes.
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Squidward: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Yes?
Squidward: Yes!
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Squidward: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Yes?
Squidward: SpongeBob! The secret?!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, okay. I face the crane. Deposit my quarter. Then I close my eyes.
Squidward: Close your eyes?
SpongeBob: Quiet, Squidward. I'm being the crane.
Squidward: Oh, that's ludi...
Skill Crane: Winner!
SpongeBob: See? Now you try.
Squidward: This is ridiculous, if I close my eyes, how will I know where the...
SpongeBob: Squidward, do you wanna win or not? 
Squidward: [presses face against machine] YES, YES, I DO!!!!!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, put your quarter in.
Squidward: But this is my last quarter.
SpongeBob: In the machine, Squidward.
Squidward: Okay, okay. [he puts the quarter in the machine]
SpongeBob: Close your eyes. [Squidward does] Now be the crane. [while SpongeBob is telling him this, Squidward is playing the game] Be the crane... be the crane... be the crane.
Skill Crane: Winner!
Squidward: Whoo-hoo! Yeah! I knew I could do it! [laughs] I'm a winner!
SpongeBob: You're a winner!
Squidward: I am a winner, aren't I? [jumps up and down] Winner, winner, winner! [twirls] Wiiiiiinner! [over loudspeaker] I'M A WINNER, EVERYBODY!!! YOU HEAR THAT!?! [cricket chirps in the empty restaurant. Squidward goes into Mr. Krabs' office, holds the teddy bear] I'm... a winner!
Mr. Krabs: That's funny. Last I checked, you were a cashier.
Squidward: Yuck it up all you want, Mr. Krabs. But just remember, you're yucking in the presence... of a winner! [shoves the bear in his face] HA! [runs out the door]
Mr. Krabs: I'll try to remember that. [as he counts all of Squidward's quarters] 3,498 of Squidward's quarters... 3,499 of Squidward's quarters.
SpongeBob: Triple decker, on deck.
Squidward: [slams door in SpongeBob's face] Make way for the winner! [door opens to SpongeBob having the triple decker hanging out of his mouth like an accordion]
Skill Crane: You lose! [Billy sighs]
Squidward: You didn't win the prize?
Billy: No...
Squidward: You know what that means?
Billy: No, what?
Squidward: It means, you have no skills and you're a loser! HA! Hahahaha! I'm a winner, see my prize, you're a loser who sits and cries! [he laughs, then Billy kicks him in the shin] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! [later, Squidward and SpongeBob are walking out of the Krusty Krab] Did you see how I handled that crane?
SpongeBob: I sure did.
Squidward: I think I had the magic touch.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Squidward: I just closed my eyes and became the crane.
SpongeBob: [getting exasperated] Oh, yeah, you're the man.
Squidward: SpongeBob, look. [a real crane is just a few yards away. Squidward runs to it]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Squidward, I don't think the same principles apply.
Squidward: Be the crane...
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward!
Squidward: Be the crane... [picks up an I-beam]
SpongeBob: He did it. Yay, Squidward!
Squidward: Be the crane... be the crane... be the…
Construction Worker: You know this guy?
SpongeBob: Yeah, that's Squidward. He's got the magic touch. [pokes the construction worker] Ding. [Squidward knocks a bunch of buildings over with the I-beam; a sign reads "Your New Mall". The construction worker is twitching in fury] Tada! [notices the mess] Ah! Squidward, open your eyes!
Squidward: [opens eyes] Oh, uhh, be the crane. Be the crane. [can't control crane; he whacks the workers with a beam] Look out, SpongeBob. I can't stop! [crane chases after SpongeBob and the workers; SpongeBob's eyes bug out so he runs away on them] Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. Okay, don't be the crane! Don't be the crane!! [Everybody runs in terror into the Krusty Krab. The crane spins around fast and heads towards the Krusty Krab and as the workers and SpongeBob duck, Squidward destroys it]
Mr. Krabs: What the?
Squidward: Oh, my. Ohhh, my. Uhh... time to go, Teddy. [bumps into large construction worker]
Milt: Just where do you think you're going, crane master? [All workers surround Squidward, ready to beat him up]
Gerome: You ain't going anywhere.
SpongeBob: [whistles] Hang on, buddy. I got ya. [uses crane to get Squidward, but instead gets his prize] I guess I can only pick up toys.
Squidward: [workers growl] Uh-oh!


SpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary. [takes off shoes and socks but socks still standing up but when SpongeBob throws them on the floor, the socks go down and Gary puts them on his eyes]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary. [pulls socks off Gary's eyes] You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. [snores and a dream cloud appears with the background of Krusty Krab stuff. SpongeBob eyes appear then his shoes and then his mouth on a rock] Hey! Over here! [laughs while his arms wiggle on the ground. Both arms attach to the rock and the rock moves over to the other items. SpongeBob's arms grab the eyes and puts them on the rock, his pants start appearing, and then his legs come out and put his shoes on and his body is seen. A car comes over SpongeBob and sits him in it. SpongeBob's nose grows out] Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! [driver's license appears] Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! [Car starts to move crazily] I sure take a good picture. [drives through a sign that says "Road Ends"] Darn! I should have grown a mustache. [the boat starts bumping up and down rapidly; SpongeBob is now driving off-road, hitting bumps in the sand; he smashes into a rock and flies out of the boat, still holding his license] How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. [flies over the Krusty Krab] Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. [Mrs. Puff floats up to him] Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
Mrs. Puff: [takes his license and tears it up] Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
SpongeBob: No! [flies through the dream cloud and on SpongeBob's real bed] Ouch! Where am I? [walks and looks up to his real self] Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
Gary: Meow. [snoring] Meow.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Gary's dream cloud] This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. [jumps into the dream cloud. He falls down into a library] Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. [walks past a pile of books] Gary! Huh? [sees Gary, who is now taller and wearing a cape, reading a book. He walks up to him] Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? [Gary turns around]
Gary: [gasps] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gary?
Gary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
SpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!
Gary: [sighs] In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Gary: Come. [they walk down an aisle of books] For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. [picks up a book and reads from it] "Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again." Emily Dickinson wrote that.
SpongeBob: Who?
Gary: [flips a few pages] Here's one you might know. [clears throat] There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
Gary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. [starts walking away]
Gary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
SpongeBob: [jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window] I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. [Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring. SpongeBob runs over] I can't resist! [laughs and jumps into the dream cloud. Inside, he opens a door to see Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride amidst the blank, white scenery] Hey, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [walks over] You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. [transforms into the shape of a skyscraper] Going up! Eh? [sees that Patrick is unresponsive and frowns, then perks up again] I can make... [changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself] A million of me! Eh? Eh?
Patrick: Yup. [the clones disappear] 
SpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. [leaves]
Patrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob. [kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away] Oh! [the quarter falls into a grate] Shoot, that was my last quarter. [sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good! [inflates himself with air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head] Psst! Squidward! [waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing] Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
King: Ahem! [sitting in the balcony above the stage] Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Squidward: Yes, Your Highness. [Squidward resumes playing, but SpongeBob tells the king a joke. The king laughs and Squidward stops playing again. He angrily stands up] SpongeBob!
King: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! [giggles, turns to SpongeBob and nudges him with his elbow] Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
Squidward: [growling, pressing down on his clarinet] Sponge- [accidentally breaks the clarinet. The audience gasps] Bob...
King: [angry] I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
Squidward: [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: [as a clarinet] Squidward! [points to himself and winks] Huh? Huh?
Squidward: [throws his broken clarinet pieces off-stage. Speaking with his back turned] No way.
King: Ahem! [glares down at Squidward]
Squidward: [sighs and picks SpongeBob up] Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.
SpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward. [Squidward blows into him]
SpongeBob: [off-key] La la! La la la la la la la! [The audience gasps again]
Squidward: [stops playing] SpongeBob!
King: [crying] Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
[Squidward smiles and SpongeBob winks at him]
SpongeBob: [continues singing off-key]
Fish: [crying] His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
[crowd cheers]
Squidward: [bowing] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [the crowd knocks him aside into a fruit wagon and a fish grabs SpongeBob]
Fish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
SpongeBob: [turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him. Squidward has climbed out of the wagon and is a mess] So long, Squidward! [Squidward starts to growl at him, but the audience members push him back into the fruit wagon and chase after SpongeBob. The King follows, too, laughing. SpongeBob runs out the door and flies away.]
Squidward: [starts tossing and turning in his bed, mumbling in angered pain]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands on the top of the tree dome] Hey! I'm at Sandy's! [Sandy sleeps in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door] Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... [falls out of the plane and screams]
Sandy: [surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?
Sandy: [turns upside down] Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. [a target is shown on the ground. SpongeBob and Sandy spin around]
SpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!
Sandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
SpongeBob: Okay! [gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate]
Sandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! [turns upside-down again]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger]
Sandy: Not a parakeet! Para- [Lands in a truck of clam manure, parachute inflates out of time] medic...
SpongeBob: [screams as he crashes through the target, breaking the ground and flips on the real-life ground] Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. [sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house] H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. [climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream. Shows a view of various girly decorations, other girly features and boyfriend portraits.] Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Pearl: Hello, SpongeBob! [sits at a table with a green rabbit toy and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup]
SpongeBob: [waves] Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Pearl: You're just in time for the tea party!
SpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Pearl: [Frowns] Oh. He's next door. [Rolls eyes, then shakes head in disappointment] Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
SpongeBob: Bye! [gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs on the right side of the screen] I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. [peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs’ boat]
Krabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon! [inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod] You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. [SpongeBob hops into the boat]
SpongeBob: Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Krabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. [Moby Dollar appears from the water, caught on the fishing hook] It's the mighty Moby Dollar! [Starts reeling in, making the Moby Dollar come closer and closer.] Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes! [Moby Dollar starts spitting out pennies] There she blows!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
Krabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
SpongeBob: [grabs a small jellyfishing net] This one?
Krabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
SpongeBob: [reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it] Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Krabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
SpongeBob: [opens up the wallet] Net ready, sir!
Krabs: [pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet] I did it! [gets excited] I finally did it!
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. [puts down the wallet to shake hands with Mr. Krabs, but the wallet starts bouncing away toward the back of the boat]
Krabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
SpongeBob: Huh?
Krabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! [SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat]
SpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!
Krabs: No! [dollar hops out of wallet and jumps like a dolphin away in the ocean]
SpongeBob: [grins nervously as Krabs glares at him] This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: [ties SpongeBob up with a rope tied to a plunger sticking out of a gun] You're fired! [Fires the gun, shooting the plunger and tossing SpongeBob with it]
SpongeBob: [screams as he gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building. The plunger is stuck onto a building.] Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: Zap! [zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out] I see you. [stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self] Zap! [shoots a green laser out of his eye]
Fred: My leg!
Plankton: I see you. Zap!
SpongeBob: Plankton! [tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle]
Plankton: I see you... [SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground] Zap! [zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on, then walks to the Krusty Krab. People continue to scream in panic] Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. [stomps on it] Crush! [picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it as if it were a lollipop and walks off] Lick, lick!
SpongeBob: This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary: Meow! Meow!
SpongeBob: [Stops and looks. Appears more and more worried.] Gary! Gary! No!
Gary: Meow! [Plankton still coming towards Gary making giant step sounds]
Plankton: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
SpongeBob: Gary! [jumps over to Gary and hugs him] I've got you, Gary!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! [steps on SpongeBob and Gary] Yeah! Huh? [lifts his foot from pain] Yow!
SpongeBob: [looking like a thumbtack] I think he's got the point. [laughs]
Plankton: [Starts shrinking.] Waaaaaah! [as he screams his voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal, puny size. Three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad] Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? [Burned Fred lifts his foot to step on him] No! No! No! Not the face! [gets squished. Wakes up screaming and his dream cloud pops, making dream SpongeBob fall to the ground]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping] Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. [goes to sleep] Ah... [wakes up after hearing his friends voices and faces hovering around his head]
Squidward: [his head starts circling SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [The heads of Mr Krabs, Sandy, Gary, Plankton, Pearl and Patrick start surrounding SpongeBob]
All: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tossing and turning in his sleep] What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! [Squidward taps him and he wakes up.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams, then sees his friends stand around his bed, except Patrick] Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
Squidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!
Sandy: Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!
All except Patrick: [grumble in agreement]
Plankton: Take a hike!
Squidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Gary: [In anger] Meow!
Patrick: [walks in] Does anyone have a quarter? [all stare at Patrick]


Squidward: Well, Squidward, ol' boy, all that's left is to go win that dancing trophy and give it a home. After all, nobody ever worked harder to get it than you. [flashback to him dancing with some other fish] All those years of training with the masters. Your tireless effort to keep your instrument supple. [flashback to him getting his legs twisted and stretched] Not to mention your weekly thigh waxing. [pulls some hair off his leg as a scream is heard] And now, it's time to go get it. So, let's do it. Whoo...! [runs out of his house and into a bar of bamboo]
Patrick: Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Want to give me a ruling, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win.
Squidward: What? What are you two doing?
SpongeBob: We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.
Patrick: We're gonna win the trophy.
Squidward: Ha. The two of you? Don't make me laugh. Come here... see that? That's where the trophy's going. [shows them the trophy case]
SpongeBob: You built us a trophy case for when we win? [both hug Squidward] Oh, you are a true friend.
Squidward: No, you twits. I built that trophy case for me when I win. I'm going to ace the tryouts today and then I'm going to the finals tomorrow and win the trophy. I am going forth to meet my destiny. Good-bye. [runs out but runs into the limbo bar again]
Patrick: Ruling, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I think we better raise the bar. [cut to the tryouts where Squidward sits down on the bench]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Hiya, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh, great. The flying Gyvonne Brothers. Just ignore them, Squidward.
Female: [over loudspeaker] Contestants 51 and 52 to the stage, please.
SpongeBob: We're up, Patrick. Wish us luck, Squidward.
Squidward: Do I know you?
SpongeBob: [laughs] You kidder. Let's go, Patrick.
Squidward: Poor boobs, they don't stand a chance. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward.
Squidward: You actually got in?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Squidward: Humph, if those two nitwits made it then I'm a shoo-in.
Female: [over loudspeaker] Contestant 53 to the stage, please.
Squidward: Look out, dancing world, here comes your future. Music, please. [dances]
Judge: Next.
Squidward: Excuse me?
Judge: You're done. You know, next contestant. You didn't make the cut, sorry, Mac.
Squidward: But, but, but, but, you don't understand. I already build a trophy case with the cutest little plaque. If I could just touch it...
Judge: Hey!
Squidward: But I, hey... Unhand me, you brutes. Ah! [cut to Squidward crying into his house and walking into a limbo bar again]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward.
Squidward: Doh, help me up.
SpongeBob: How'd the audition go, Squidward?
Squidward: [gets choked up] The audition? My trophy? [sobs uncontrollably] I mean, uh, uh, yeah, the audition. [chuckles] Evidently, I'm such a great dancer that I've been banned from the competition for life.
Patrick: Whoa.
SpongeBob: Impressive. [gasps] Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?
Squidward: What? I've got better thinks to do than help you two dopes.
Patrick: Like polishing your empty trophy case?
Squidward: Fine. But I keep the trophy when we win, deal?
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Deal.
Squidward: Ok. Show me what you got, Patrick.
Patrick: Ok, here I go. Watch me now. [goes under the limbo stick but gets a butt cramp before going all the way through] Cramp! [screams and rolls around. Squidward opens the door and Patrick rolls outside]
Squidward: Well, I guess that just leaves you, SpongeBob. Show me your stuff. Ready, and... [turns on some music. SpongeBob laughs and wiggles his arms and legs all around the room. Squidward grabs his arms] Having fun?
SpongeBob: Yes, yes I am.
Squidward: SpongeBob, dancing isn't supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be art and art is suffering! Now, we'll start with some ballet. Watch my feet and follow my lead. Ready, and...plié. [SpongeBob and Squidward bend their knees] Relevé. [twirl around on their toes] And now grand jeté. [Squidward slips on the limbo stick] Where am I? See if I can find the lights. [turns on the light and sees a giant SpongeBob face. Squidward's head is stuck inside SpongeBob's body] Wait a minute. [feels around] This gives me an idea. [Squidward's body is now inside SpongeBob's] Ready, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [salutes] Ready!
Squidward: A one and a two, and... [SpongeBob dances] Plié, jeté, relevé - [SpongeBob's legs get tangled in a knot] No, no, no. This will never work. You've got two left feet.
SpongeBob: [takes off feet] How'd you know? [he wiggles both of his left pair of toes]
Squidward: Gimme those. [takes SpongeBob's legs and puts his own legs through SpongeBob's pants] That's better. Ok, let's go. SpongeBob, what are you doing? [SpongeBob's arms are in the air wiggling] Why are you moving your arms like that?
SpongeBob: [laughs] I guess they're happy.
Squidward: Argh, hand 'em over. [SpongeBob hands Squidward one of his arms] And the other one, come on. [Squidward breaks off the other one then uses his arms as SpongeBob's] Ah, now that's more like it.
SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help.
Squidward: Are you questioning my leadership.
SpongeBob: Well, I just...
Squidward: Ok, hand it over. [SpongeBob hands his mouth to Squidward]
SpongeBob: You know what, Squidward?
Squidward: What's that?
SpongeBob: I think I'm suffering for my art now. [cut to the dance recital where Pilar is already dancing] Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.
Squidward: Oh, please. Just wait until you see my brilliant moves.
[Pilar who is dancing falls on his face. The crowd gasps as the judges give him a total score of 5. The next dancer is a whale balancing a ball on its head. The judges total score is 23.5. The next dancer is a giant sea horse, then a dancer who can balance coins on his arms while jumping up and down. The judges score him a 29.5]
SpongeBob: Oh my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent.
Squidward: Quit groveling. Where is your dignity? [gets SpongeBob up and slaps him] These losers are here to worship us. I mean me. By the end of the night I'll have them on their knees just begging for more.
Female: [over loudspeaker] Now that's what I like to call a hard act to follow. Next up, we have SpongeBob SquarePants.
Frank: Oh, man. I can't wait. I am so stoked on dancing right now.
SpongeBob: Now, before I begin, let me just thank you all for coming out tonight. [Squidward grabs SpongeBob's mouth]
Squidward: Will you stop it? And let my dancing do the talking. [dances]
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent.
Squidward: Of course they have. They are in the presence of a true artiste.
Frank: What's he doing?
Nat: Is he hurt?
Nathiel: I don't know man, but it's hurting my eyes.
Clay: I think I'm gonna be sick. [throws up]
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward?
Squidward: Ha. If they think that's good, wait till they see... [gets a knot in his leg] Cramp! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! [bounces around on the floor on his headwhile everyone leaves. Fred was asleep wakes up and is about to walk out the door. All grumbling and leaving, except blue man]
Fred: Hey, guys, wait up. Huh? What's this? [sees SpongeBob dancing] That's kind of nice. Hey guys, come check this out.
Squidward: Must finish dance... on other... [gets another cramp in the other leg]
SpongeBob: Um, Squidward, is this part of the act?
Squidward: [screams] The pain! [crowd cheers and throws flower onto the stage]
Judge #2: By unanimous decision, we have a winner.
Squidward: [gasps] Mine! [grabs the trophy and hugs it] I won, I won!
Judge #2: Never before have I seen such zest, such joie de vivre.
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, you're too kind. But I couldn't have done it without a very special someone. [grabs Squidward]
Squidward: Wait, SpongeBob, no! [is pulled out from SpongeBob's body]
Judge #2: The rulebook clearly states "A single dancer must perform without any further assistance from a partner." Therefore, you're the winner. [hands trophy to coin balancing dancer]
Fish #6: Oh man, the jig's up, Pedro. We're going home. [rips his wig in half and shows Pedro inside of it]
Pedro: It's all right, I'll go call a taxi.
Judge #2: Merciful Neptune. Are there any more cheaters?
Fish #7: [takes off the sea horse costume] Ah, crud, we're two dancers.
Scottish Octopus: We're nine dancers, actually. [lifts his kilt up to show 8 little ones around his legs]
Pilar: [takes Frank out of his pants] Does this count?
Judge #2: Isn't there a single dancer here who is not assisted by a partner?
Judge: Uh, what about number 52 over there? [Patrick is moving around on the ground screaming]
Judge #2: Is he alone?
Judge: Well, let me see. [looks inside Patrick's mouth] Why, yes, he is a single dancer.
Judge #2: Oh, well, then. I guess he wins. [Patrick screams some more as everyone else, except Squidward cheers]
SpongeBob: I love your new dance, Patrick.
Patrick: Thanks.
Narrator: Epilogue.
Norma: Tommy? I've got a fresh load of laundr- [screams as she thinks Tommy is having a seizure on the floor] Tommy! Oh! Oh, dear me, no! [dials phone numbers] Hello, it's an emergency! My son! He's-
Tommy: [scoffs] Mom, calm down. [stops music] I'm just doing "The Cramp"!
Norma: [hangs up phone] Oh, oh you kids and your crazy dance fads. [she laughs and is soon joined by Mr Krabs, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward]
Patrick: Hey, everybody, let's all do "the cramp"!
All: Yeah! [Norma sets up the music. Everybody dances "the cramp" and scream]


[episode starts with SpongeBob sweating and his foot makes a slurping sound]
Squidward: [sweating] If it gets any hotter in here, we're gonna have to put fried calamari on the menu.
SpongeBob: It's a good thing that new ceiling fan Mr. Krabs installed is still working. [The fan stops]
Mr. Krabs: Were you talking to me, Squidward?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs. The f-f...
Mr. Krabs: Good word, boy! Don't sneak up on me like that.
SpongeBob: The fan... it...
Mr. Krabs: You're not wearing shoes, lad. You're not going Section 8 on me, are ya?
SpongeBob: I was wearing shoes. They... It's so hot, they melted off.
Mr. Krabs: Melted off?
Squidward: The fan stopped working.
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you didn't... forget... to pay the power bill again, did you?
Mr. Krabs: Of course not! Here. Just fan yourself with some of this junk mail I keep finding in me mail box. [gives SpongeBob the "junk mail," which says: Power Bill Final Notice]
SpongeBob: [fans himself]
Mr. Krabs: That reminds me. Where are all me customers?
Squidward: Probably out enjoying this beautiful day where it was meant to be enjoyed.
Mr. Krabs: Could you be a little more specific?
Squidward: They're at the beach.
Mr. Krabs: Boys, I forgot to tell ya! Close up shop. We're going to the beach today!
[SpongeBob rips off his squarepants revealing a blue swimsuit, innertube, waterwings and snorkel. The scene cuts to Goo Lagoon]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy there!
Nat: Whoa!
Mr. Krabs: My name is Eugene Krabs and I would like to know if I could interest either one of you in a fresh, delicious...
SpongeBob: [picks up a Krabby Patty with his spatula]
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patty, fresh off the grill!
Frank: Are they free?
Mr. Krabs: Yes! Today, they're only three dollars! Each.
Frank: Sounds great. But I left my wallet up on the sand.
Squidward: I told you!
Sandy: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
SpongeBob: What?
Sandy: -eeeeeeeeeeeeeee-
Frank: [shrugs]
Sandy: -eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-haw! I love the beach!
SpongeBob: Oh, that noise was Sandy.
Sandy: Y'all be careful! Looks like some big waves a-comin'!
Squidward: Who are you?
Mr. Krabs: Either you buy a patty, or get off me wave!
Sandy: Cowabunga!
Squidward: What next?
Patrick: [pops up from underwater]
SpongeBob: Aloha, Patrick!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, there, young feller! How'd you like to be our first customer in over seventeen working days?
Patrick: I'd love to!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, show him the menu.
Squidward: [holds up the menu]
Patrick: Uh, I can't quite see it from here. I'll just have to climb on board.
SpongeBob: Ha, ha, ha! That's a good one Patrick: on-board! Whoa!
[Patrick is trying to climb onto the surfboard]
Mr. Krabs: Careful! You're gonna capsize us!
Patrick: Almost up! [shaking the board all over the place]
Squidward: You idiot!
Patrick: [waving arms uncontrollably. This moves the surfboard] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Eeeeeeee!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Look out!
Sandy: [riding a wave] Locals only!
Patrick: What'd she say?
[all crash]
Mr. Krabs: Aaaaaaaaahhhhh! [hugs his cash register] Aaaaahhhhhh!
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [hug Squidward] Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Sandy: Wipeouuuuuuuuuuuuuut! [lands on an island]
Mr. Krabs: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! [lands in the middle of the ocean] Wha? Where'd the beach go? These waters are calm. Too calm. [Dark clouds fill the sky] Black sky. [Blood shoots out of the water] Water spouts.... of blood. [Three donuts fall from the sky. Krabs takes a bite of one] Jelly donuts falling from the sky. What could this mean? There's only one logical answer. I've landed right in the middle of Dutchman's Triangle. Right above Davy Jones' Locker. In the Devil's Galley. [another donut falls from the sky. The scene cuts to an island. Not the one Sandy landed on, but an island]
Awesome Eddie: Guys, look!
SpongeBob: [uses seaweed to draw in the sand]
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing with that seaweed?
SpongeBob: Just dragging it around.
Twitch: Hey there, home-dads.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Twitch: Welcome to our remote island.
SpongeBob: Island?
Squidward: Island?
[Patrick is snoring]
Twitch: That's right, kemo sabe. Island. Although, we sometimes refer to it as an... island.
SpongeBob: We were just at Goo Lagoon selling Krabby Patties when this big wave hit us. Now we're on an island?
Twitch: The ocean works in mysterious ways.
Awesome Eddie: And waves.
Twitch: Mysterious waves.
Island wanderers: [fold hands] Om. [except for Silent Stan but he does put his hands together]
Patrick: [folds hands] Om.
SpongeBob: How did you guys get here?
Twitch: Oh, we've been here since we dropped out of junior college. This is Awesome Eddie, Big G...
Chip: Hi.
Twitch: Chip, and Silent Stan.
[Silent Stan makes a "Shocka!" sign since he can't talk]
Twitch: And I'm Twitch.
SpongeBob: Why do they call you Twitch?
Twitch: [twitches] What?
SpongeBob: Never mind.
[The scene cuts to either later that day or a few days later]
SpongeBob: So what did you say this house is made from again?
Twitch: Guano.
Squidward: Great.
SpongeBob: Well, it's been fun hanging out with you guys, but Mr. Krabs didn't give us the day off. So we gotta get back to Goo Lagoon.
Twitch: Yo, you're miles from the tourist track now, dude.
Awesome Eddie: Yeah. The only way back is to surf there.
SpongeBob: [scared] O-only way.... back... surfing.... Bikini Bottom? [screams] Aaaaahhhhhh! [starts running in circles around the fire] I don't know how to surf! [starts crying]
Awesome Eddie: Whoa, chill out, little dude. We can teach you.
SpongeBob: [stops running and crying] Cool!
[The scene cuts to a scene where Twitch is teaching SpongeBob and Patrick to surf. A narrator speaks]
Narrator: Ah, learning how to surf. To some it comes as easily as eating an ice cream cone on a hot day.
[Twitch gives SpongeBob and Patrick each a surfboard]
Narrator: Others...
[SpongeBob and Patrick take bites out of their surfboards]
Narrator: ... to them, it's like eating an ice cream cone... on a cold day. Sometimes, in surfing, it's the approach that's most important.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [throw their boards into the water]
Narrator: And sometimes, it's the retreat.
[SpongeBob and Patrick's surfboards get hit by a wave and are knocked back to shore. Everyone runs away from the flying surfboards, screaming.. SpongeBob, Patrick and Twitch are sitting on surfboards]
Narrator: Once in a life-time, that perfect wave comes along. Not too big, not too small, and the surfer has to act fast...
Twitch: Go!
Narrator: ... or he stands to miss the ride of his life.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! Wanna see something cool?
Patrick: You bet!
SpongeBob: Down here! [goes underwater with Patrick] See? It's a picture of Squidward!
Patrick: Wow.
Narrator: But all in all, in life, it's not whether we win or lose, but whether we get totally stoked.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [running around while yelling, "Loo, loo, loo!" over and over again.. The scene cuts back to the house made of guano]
Twitch: Well, dudes, I give up.
Awesome Eddie: What?
Twitch: These ho-dads are impossible to teach. [twitches] Especially the one on the end over there. [points to Squidward, whose head is wet and has seaweed on it. Big G coughs]
Awesome Eddie: What's that?
[Big G coughs again]
Awesome Eddie: Oh, no. There's no way, dude. He'd never do it.
[Big G coughs again]
SpongeBob: What's he saying?
Twitch: He reminded us that there is one dude who could possibly teach you. If you can find him.
SpongeBob: Who?
Twitch: His name [twitches] is Jack Kahuna Laguna. Or JKL, for short.
Awesome Eddie and Chip: Amen. [Big G coughs]
Twitch: We say that legend says that JKL was last seen up-river at the Kahmamoku Cove, where every wave is perfect.
Patrick: Will there be nachos there? [Squidward looks angrily at him. The scene cuts to the river that SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are about to go into]
SpongeBob: Thanks again for letting us borrow these surfboards, Twitch.
Twitch: [twitches] No problem. And just keep following the river straight up until you hit Kahmamoku Cove. Can't miss it.
SpongeBob: How far up stream did you say it was?
Twitch: Well, we don't know cause we've never ever been there.
Awesome Eddie: We're definitely afraid of this river and wouldn't even set foot in it if you paid us.
Twitch: Yeah, interpret that any way you want.
[On the TV version, commercials are shown. When they end, Sandy is shown lying on a beach]
Sandy: Oh, where am I? Where is everybody? I'm stranded. SpongeBob, where are you?!
[As a song plays, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward paddle themselves slowly up-river. Eventually, they come across a waterfall. Patrick takes a picture of it and SpongeBob stares at it, admiringly. Squidward sits, bored. Then, they go down a waterfall. They scream and land. At the bottom SpongeBob and Patrick laugh while Squidward sits, bored]
♪I'll make a beeline for the treeline. Getting back to nature always does me good. I'll make a beeline for the treeline, I just can't wait to get back in the woods. And if I need to close my eyes and dream, Of some quite mountain or stream, That's when I make the beeline for the treeline.♪
SpongeBob: Could you pull over here? I gotta tie my shoe.
Squidward: Again?!
SpongeBob: [walks through a bush and comes across a sign that says, Welcome to Kahmamoku Cove, Home of J.K.L., ESO] Welcome to Kahmamoku Cove! JKL! Guys! Guys! I found the Cove! [giggles]
Squidward: I bet this guy won't even be here. If he's anything like that last group of dirty drop-outs.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Squidward. He'll be here.
Squidward: You've never even seen him!
SpongeBob: You've got to stop judging people by the way they look. [close-up on his face. He is very ugly]
Squidward: [grossed out] You're right.
Patrick: [pointing to a hut] Look!
[a really long surfboard begins to emerge from the hut]
SpongeBob: It's him!
Squidward: [sighs. The surfboard continues to come out. It is revealed to be huge] Oh, my- [faints. A man emerges from the hut]
SpongeBob: It's JKL! [Gulps] Hail O great swami of the Gnarly Pounders! We seek audience with thee.
Patrick: Plus, we wanna talk to you.
SpongeBob: Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home? [JKL says nothing]
Patrick: Uh...
Squidward: Look, surf-boy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day?
Patrick: I kinda like staring at him.
[Jack Kahuna Laguna jumps into the water with his surfboard. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward stare at him. Dolphins jump near the back of JKL's surfboard. SpongeBob and Patrick start to tear up]
SpongeBob: I've never seen anything more beautiful. Have you, Patrick?
Patrick: Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake.
JKL: That... was your first lesson. [returns to his hut]
Squidward: What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!
JKL: [magically returnes to the water. we then see him playing his drums] Just keep breathing.
[The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs sitting on half a surfboard in the middle of the ocean. He has put a piece of seaweed on the top of his cash register. He has also grown a gray beard] [makes gibberish noises]
Mr. Krabs:  [pulls a shell out of the water] Look, Cashy! [breaks the shell in half and connects them to the sides of the seaweed] Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesn’t appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy? [Cashy's drawer shoots out and hits the Flying Dutchman in the head who's flying by]
Flying Dutchman: Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Arrrgh! It's the Flying Dutchman!
Flying Dutchman: [drops his groceries] Aaahhh! It's some guy I've never seen before! Argh! Who be disturbing the Flying Dutchman's walk home from the convenience store? You even spilled me milk!
Mr. Krabs: Well, there ain't no use crying over it. [Lightning bolts shoot everywhere] Yah! Don't worry, Cashy! I’ll protect ye!
[The scene cuts to the island where SpongeBob and his friends are. They are sitting around a fire]
SpongeBob: Isn't Jack Kahuna Laguna the most totally awesome surf guru you've ever met, Squidward?
Squidward: I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is...
[JKL walks by the fire and sits down with his drums]
Squidward: [sarcastic] Oh, wonderful.
SpongeBob: Quiet, Squidward! I think we're about to receive another lesson.
JKL: [plays his drums. Eventually, he stops, lifts his hands to the air, then plays the drums again] Just... keep breathing. [returns to his hut]
Squidward: That's it?! I just wanna go home! [buries his head in his lap]
SpongeBob: Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?
Squidward: Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob walks away, then immediately returns] Well, did you talk to him?
SpongeBob: Yup.
Squidward: And?
SpongeBob: He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed.
Squidward: We're gonna be stuck here forever!
[The scene cuts to Sandy's island]
Sandy: Well, Sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. You've built a five star hotel, a steam-powered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. I almost don't wanna leave. But I miss Bikini Bottom. Now I can find SpongeBob and the gang and fly us right back. [climbs into and activates her helicopter] Acorn 1 to Tower. Request clearance.
Dennis: Roger, Acorn 1. You are clear for take-off.
[Sandy flies away. The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs, the Flying Dutchman, and Cashy]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!
Flying Dutchman: Well, normally, I wouldn't mind, but I'm a little low on cash this month, and I have no way to pay for more. Unless you have some money I can borrow.
Mr. Krabs: No, I... [Dutchman grabs Cashy] Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!
[The scene cuts to one of the islands. A wave washes up on Squidward]
Squidward: Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [tired from staring all night] Okay...
Squidward: All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna...
JKL: You obviously didn't stare into the fire all night like your friends over there.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are knocked out]
JKL: Those dudes are gonna make awesome surfers. [A storm of lightning starts. JKL runs away]
SpongeBob: Where's he going?! Come on! [chases after JKL. Patrick and Squidward follow SpongeBob. SpongeBob and Patrick are running, but Squidward is walking. SpongeBob and Patrick climb up a cliff]
SpongeBob: [gets shocked by lightning] [screams] Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Patrick: Look! He's on top of that big... drinking fountain!
[Squidward climbs the cliff. SpongeBob and Patrick climb the pyramid. Squidward follows]
SpongeBob: JKL! Is this the next part of our training?
JKL: [hands in the air. He says this in a strange, echoing voice] Uh...
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: [screaming in some way]
JKL: These clouds. They can only mean one thing.
Patrick: Increased chance of precipitation? [it starts raining]
JKL: Yes. Every thousand years or so, the planets align in such a way that a perfect wave is formed.
SpongeBob: A perfect wave?
JKL: The world's biggest, fastest, longest, gnarliest, most totally awesome, perfect wave. They call it.... the Big One.
Patrick: Hey, that's what they used to call me!
JKL: It's probably the only wave big enough for you to ride all the way back to Bikini Bottom. You'll have to catch it, or you'll be stuck here... forever. [Huge lightning bolts flash] The Big One is almost upon us.
[The scene cuts to Mr. Krabs and the Flying Dutchman fighting over Cashy]
Mr. Krabs: Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!
Flying Dutchman: Ya promise?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yes. I promise on my dear Aunt Sally's false teeth.
Flying Dutchman: [angry] Liar! [Huge lightning bolts flash. Storm clouds hover and waves emerge from the water]
Mr. Krabs: What?
Flying Dutchman: Your Aunt Sally doesn't wear false teeth!
Mr. Krabs: How do you know?
Flying Dutchman: Because I dated her in high school!
Mr. Krabs: [Gasp!] No! [Dutchman takes Cashy]
Flying Dutchman: Whoops! [accidentally throws Cashy]
Sandy: This weather sure is dangerous! I better be careful! [Cashy hits the helicopter's windshield] May Day! May Day! I'm goin' down! Repeat: Down!
Flying Dutchman: And now, just to make sure this never happens again, I'm gonna send you on a little trip down the- [Sandy's helicopter hits him in the head] -Ooh ow, ooh ow! Ooh!
Mr. Krabs: Uh... where is that, exactly? [Dutchman lands on him. They both go underwater]
Sandy: [spinning out of control] May Day!
Mr. Krabs: [pops up from underwater] Oh, all alone again. [Cashy pops up from the water] Cashy!
Flying Dutchman: [lands at the bottom of the ocean. A sock lands on his face] Oh, what the... a tube sock? But that means...
Davy Jones: Yeah, that's right, baby! Welcome... to my locker! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! ♪For a day-dream believer and a homecoming queen!♪ [throws a sock at the Flying Dutchman. That same song plays. The scene cuts to Kahmamoku Cove]
JKL: Get ready, dudes. It's coming.
SpongeBob: JKL, thanks for teaching us how to surf.
JKL: Little dude, I didn't teach you anything you didn't already know.
Squidward: Here it comes!
SpongeBob: Well, JKL, I guess this is good-bye.
JKL: Wait. There's something I forgot to tell you. In return for its awesomeness, the Big One always demands a sacrifice. And one of you... will not return.
Squidward: I volunteer SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward surf toward the Big One]
SpongeBob: Keep paddling, Patrick!
Patrick: This wind feels like broken glass mixed with razor blades!
SpongeBob: It's... the Big One!
Big One: Ha ha ha ha ha! [grabs Patrick's surfboard]
Patrick: No!
Big One: [puts salt on the surfboard and takes a bite of it] Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggg!
Patrick: Hey, I was gonna eat that!
SpongeBob: Patrick, grab on!
Big One: [stares at Squidward]
Squidward: [panics] Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! [jumps on SpongeBob and Patrick's surfboard]
SpongeBob: Hang on, Squidward! This is it!
Patrick: Time for those lessons to pay off!
Squidward: Look! That's Mr. Krabs down there!
Mr. Krabs: You like it when I comb your hair, don't ya, Cashy?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Hop on or you'll be stuck here forever!
Mr. Krabs: Who said that? [gets buried by the Big One]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! I never even got a chance to tell him that I...
JKL: [on his huge surfboard] Looking for this?
SpongeBob: JKL! And Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: And Cashy! [jumps on the other surfboard. Then, he drops Cashy] Cashy!
[JKL dives off his surfboard]
SpongeBob: JKL!
[Cashy lands in the Big One's mouth. JKL follows]
SpongeBob: No!
JKL: Little dude... I was born to do this. [winks, waves good-bye, and is swallowed]
Big One: [burps]
Squidward: I guess the Big One prefers a high-protein meal.
Patrick: Now what are we gonna do?
SpongeBob: [plays JKL's drums. The storm clouds clear away and reveals a picture of JKL's face. The scene cuts to Goo Lagoon, where Nat and Shubie are lying on beach towels]
Nat: You hear a noise?
[Sandy crashes down in her helicopter]
Lifeguard: Everybody, look! A You-foe! [meaning UFO]
Jimmy-Gus: A spaceman!
Harold\Bill: [holding a pitchfork] Don't make any funny moves, spaceman! You're not conquering our world without a fight!
Sandy: [slaps the pitchfork] I'm not a spaceman, you dunder-head! It's me, Sandy! SpongeBob's friend.
Beach goers: [act bored]
Sandy: Shucks. Now I'll never find SpongeBob and Patrick.
Gus: Who?
Sandy: My friends. They went surfing and never returned.
Gus: Is one of them, like, a little square dude with big teeth?
Sandy: You some kinda mind-reader?
Gus: No. [points at SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs]
People: Welcome home! [cheering]
SpongeBob: Hey, Twitch!
Twitch: [twitches] Grab a guitar, dude! Let's party!
Big G: [coughs. Then, music starts]
Patrick: I love this song!
Mr. Krabs: [laughs]
Squidward: Look!
[JKL surfs in on a giant wave]
SpongeBob: JKL!
JKL: Just keep breathing. [holds up Cashy]
Mr. Krabs: Cashy!
SpongeBob: Turn it up, Chip! [Chip plays his saxophone harder. The episode ends with everyone dancing at the beach.]


[Episode starts in Jellyfish Fields, with a clam on top of the sign. He then gets out a breath spray. As soon as the sun rises, he coughs, instead of crowing. We now see SpongeBob and Patrick waiting at the main entrance.]
SpongeBob: [looking at watch] Just two more minutes, Patrick.
Patrick: [looking at watch, although he doesn't have one] Yup!
SpongeBob: Look! Here he comes! [The jellyfishing ranger passes them]
Patrick: Who?
[The jellyfishing ranger man switches the "closed" sign to "open." He looks at SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Ranger.
Patrick: Yeah, thanks. [both breathing]
Ranger: Yes?
SpongeBob: Aren't you forgetting something?
Patrick: Yeah, something.
Ranger: [grabs eyeballs and lets go of them] Please show me your-- [SpongeBob and Patrick show him their jellyfishing licenses] jellyfishing licenses.
[SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and go in, ignoring the "Open/Closed" sign they knocked over]
SpongeBob: [catches a three-spot jellyfish] Patrick, look! I caught a rare breed a glowing three-spot.
Patrick: Hey, I caught one, too! This one's a five-spot. [although it is a one-spot]
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Patrick, guess what?
Patrick: You like it here so much, you feel yourself being moved to a song?
SpongeBob: Yes, yes, how did you guess?
Patrick: Well, I kinda feel the movement coming on myself.
SpongeBob: Let's just start with the song.
Patrick: You mean "The Jellyfishing Song"?
SpongeBob: That's the one.
[both breathe in deeply, throw off their goggles and nets, and then start to sing in silly fashion]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: ♪Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jellyfishing song!♪ [jellyfish claps]♪Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, everyone sing along!♪ [jellyfish claps. Patrick picks up SpongeBob, starts spinning him around, &amp; throws him through the air; next scene shows SpongeBob and Patrick hanging onto a jellyfish's tentacles, while still singing the Jellyfishing Song'. they are singing on a desert island, surrounded by jellyfish clapping in rhythm, in calypso]♪I go jellyfishing in da' morn'in,♪
Patrick: [singing in calypso]♪I jellyfish all da' night!♪
SpongeBob: [singing in calypso]♪jellyfishing in da' afternoon,♪
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [singing in calypso]♪Jellyfishing make me feel all right!♪
[next shows them running through Jellyfish Fields, singing the Jellyfishing Song]
Coral: [sings in deep opera voice]♪Everybody singgggggggg♪ [A jellyfish performs a drumroll and Patrick and SpongeBob rise out of his mouth]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: ♪Everyone sing along!♪ [jellyfish beats on drum]
SpongeBob: Isn't it great that these majestic creatures have Jellyfish Fields to call their home?
Patrick: You bet! And it's highway convenient too, according to that big sign!
SpongeBob: [turns around and jumps when sees big billboard for Shelly Super Highway] Big sign? I didn't see a big- Jumping Jellyfish! That's a big sign!
Patrick: [reading board] It says, "Future site of the Shelly Super Highway."
SpongeBob: [horrified] Super highway!? Do you know what this means?!
Patrick: Well, it’s sorta like other roads, except there's no sto-
SpongeBob: I know what a superhighway is! I mean for all this jellyfish! For us! For Jellyfish Fiel-[is pulling on Patrick's skin, and accidentally rips off two pieces]-ds, uh sorry.[sticks the pieces back on]
Patrick: So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single species of flora &amp; fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?
SpongeBob: Well yeah, that's a simplified version, yeah, something like that, [angrily takes off goggles] which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, "Shelly Super Highway," from ever being built!
[Scene now takes place in Goo Lagoon, with Larry the Lobster lifting on a barbell.]
Larry: 1,397, 1,398-- [SpongeBob appears on one of the weight plates of the barbell] Whoa!
SpongeBob: Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!
Larry: Can't right now, bro. I got about 4,098 more reps to do. [SpongeBob slides out of the barbell, causing the other weight plate to lose Larry's balance.. Another scene takes place outside Shady Shoals, with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy sitting on a bench]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy! Certainly with superpowers like yours, we can stop this superhighway! [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy still in silence. APATHY! appears, then switches back to the scene] Hmmm.
[scene now outside Squidward's house]
Squidward: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I actually would like to help, but I'm just too busy right now.
SpongeBob: Too busy doing what?
Squidward: I'm too busy telling you, "No!" [slams door, with SpongeBob all in pieces.. scene in the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is seen cleaning the tables, while whistling. He then notices SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Private SpongeBob! Ahoy!
SpongeBob: [depressed] Captain Mr. Krabs, ahoy.
Mr. Krabs: Why SpongeBob, that's not your usual four-fingered salute.
SpongeBob: I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields. [sniffles]
Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this. Is there anything I can do to help?
SpongeBob: Really, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, why not?
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs! I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!
Mr. Krabs: [puzzled] Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?
SpongeBob: Yeah, why?
Mr. Krabs: Uh well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built.
SpongeBob: [gibberish, possibly trying to say "no" or "what?!", while pulling on his eyeballs]
Mr. Krabs: [smiling, walks over to a poster with charts and maps on it] Yes! I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished. You can see for yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!
SpongeBob: [sniffles, brushes away a tear] Charts and dia-[eyes widen, horrified] Mr. Krabs! Didn't you see!?
Mr. Krabs: What?
SpongeBob:  This. [folds out the rest of the diagram map] According to these plans. After the Shelly Superhighway goes right through Jellyfish Fields, it goes right over the Krusty Krab! Look, there you are, decrepit and living in a cardboard box! Then, it goes through a loop-de-loop for some reason, and goes right through the front door of the Chum Bucket!
Mr. Krabs: [horrified, then furious] What!? Who approved this plan!?
SpongeBob: [starts to read off the map, while Mr. Krab's eyes widen] "Plan approved by &amp; sponsored by Sheldon J. Plankton Enterprises, a division of No Fun Incorporated!"
Mr. Krabs: [angrily punches his claws together] C'mon, boy! Let's you and I go over and show that Plankton a piece of our minds!
SpongeBob: [smiling, rips off a corner of his head and hands it to Mr. Krabs] Think this piece will get the point across?
[cut to them walking over to the Chum Bucket]
Mr. Krabs: [yells] Alright, Plankton! It's Eugene Krabs, here, with, What's-His-Name! Now c'mon out!
Plankton: I can't.
Mr. Krabs: C'mon outside, and take what's coming to ya!
Plankton: I really can't come outside!
SpongeBob: Why not!?
Plankton: [shows him literally right in front of them, and yells angrily] Because I'm already out here, you bumbling barnacles! Open your eyes, for cryin' out loud!
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob look down and see Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, right.
Plankton: Now what's this all about, anyway?
Mr. Krabs: Don't play coy with us, Shelly. We both know you've been up to no good. Now start talking.
Plankton: All right, so I've been stealing your mail for the past five years, big whoop.
SpongeBob: Not that!
Mr. Krabs: What? You've been what?
SpongeBob: We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields. Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid.
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute. You've been what?
Plankton: Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle.
SpongeBob: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know.
Plankton: Forget it. Even if I wanted to stop the Shelly Superhighway from being built, it would be impossible.
SpongeBob: Why?
Plankton: Because the whole city has already approved it! See for yourself, through this conveniently-timed flashback.
[the scene now takes place in the Bikini Bottom Town Hall &amp; Fun Center, where the voting for the superhighway is held]
Mayor: Order. Order. Order in the Meeting Hall. [pounding gavel on one of the guard's heads. Guard puts his hat back on his head when mayor stops] Now all those in favor of paving over Jellyfish Fields and building the Shelly Superhighway, raise your right fin and say "aye."
Everyone: Aye!
Mayor: Now everyone else, just sit there, quietly.
Fish 1: I like highways.
Fish 2: I like things that are super.
Mr. Krabs: And I like saying, "aye."
[scene is back at the Chum Bucket]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, why did I say "aye"?
Plankton: Seems as though the ayes have it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to. Toodles!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs now walk towards the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: What are we gonna do now, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm gonna do the only thing I can do when me character is tested by insurmountable odds: lie on me back and sob loudly.
SpongeBob: Normally, Mr. Krabs, I would lie on my back and sob loudly too, but I am not giving up! There's still one citizen in Bikini Bottom who won't sit still in the face on this outrageous injustice!
[bubble transition to the song Give Jellyfish Fields A Chance, with SpongeBob and Patrick handing out fliers on Jellyfish Fields to two fish, but they just throw them away]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing while showing several different cards that look like their descriptions] ♪Chum Bucket, sludge bucket, highway fly away! Lilly liver, pizza giver, mashed potato, kelp tomato!♪ [next scene shows them protesting in a circle, and to be revealed they're on a car, which speeds up, making them fall off]♪All we are trying to say, is give Jellyfish Fields a chance!♪ [they each then put, "Save Jellyfish Fields" pins on their shirts or skin, and start singing with their cards again like earlier] ♪Ketchup bottle, net and goggle, tollbooth, rotten tooth, freeway plan, toast and jam, Mermaid Man, garbage can! Citrus fruit, combat boot, give a hoot, gorilla suit!♪ [next scene shows them making a poster on the Pineapple that says, "Buzz-In Tonight" to Squidward, who walks to his house] ♪All we are trying to say is give Jellyfish Fields a chance!♪ [next scene shows them pointing at, doing, associated with, or showing what they're singing as they run through town] ♪Plankton's eye, ham on rye! Larry's thigh, battle cry! Ketchup squirt, long-sleeved shirt! Self assert,♪ [duck from a flying boot] ♪Hit the Dirt! Krusty Krab, smash and grab!♪ [Mr. Krabs squishes Plankton with a hammer to reclaim his secret formula] ♪Barg 'N' Mart! Grocery cart!♪ [SpongeBob offers a “Save Jellyfish Fields” t-shirt to Taylor, but he shows he has a “Shelly Superhighway is Super” t-shirt. SpongeBob then forcefully takes the “Save Jellyfish Fields” t-shirt out of his hands] ♪All we are trying to say, is give Jellyfish fields a chance!♪ [next scene shows SpongeBob and Patrick passing Save Jellyfish Fields stickers on buildings, but Patrick accidentally puts one on a tough guy's back, and then runs away. SpongeBob turns around just as the tough guy turns around and pushes him into the ground; the town pointing process than starts again] ♪C.E.O's! Gary's toes! Squidward's nose! Pantyhose! Rocking chair, wash and wear! Empty stare, Patrick's hair! Green trees, Sandy's fleas! Rise and shine, lemon lime!

All we are trying to say, is give Jellyfish Fields,♪ [shows them dressed in hippie outfits and with a sitar and a tambourine] ♪a chance.♪ [song ends as an angry mob throws trash at them] It's working, Patrick! They're booing the highway! Looks like our message has really gotten through to the people! Let's play a song while their hearts are open! [a sheet of paper flies in his face] Hey wait a minute. This is one of our fliers! They're pelting us with our own pamphlets! [to Patrick] What does this mean!
Patrick: I, couldn't tell you.
Nat: I'll tell you what it means! It means this! [grabs the tambourine and stomps on it]
SpongeBob: [confused] It means, you hate tambourines?
Fish: No! It means-[is interrupted by police who come up in their car]
Police Fish #1: Alright, you guys the highway haters?
SpongeBob: Yes sir, but with good reason. You see, without Jellyfish Fields, jellyfish will have to find a new home and- [he and Patrick are put in handcuffs]
Police Fish #2: Alright, you two. You're under arrest!
SpongeBob: What for?
Police Fish #1: Unlicensed use of a sitar!
SpongeBob: [confused] But, my grandma gave me this sitar! It didn't come with a license.
Police Fish #2: [raises baton] Yeah well, neither did this! [SpongeBob and Patrick are dragged away by police while crowd behind them yells, "Highway! Highway!"] [cut to the police car getting driven out of town]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I'll never forget what my great-Uncle Cletus said right before he was arrested during a freedom march.
SpongeBob: What was that?
Patrick: It's when a bunch of people go walkin' on the street, an-
SpongeBob: [annoyed] I know what a freedom march is Patrick! I mean, what did he say?
Patrick: Oh, [chuckles]. He said, "Let not your heart walk away from you, let your mind grow legs and follow it."
SpongeBob: [impressed] Wow. Your uncle sounds like a pretty smart guy, Patrick! What happened to him after he was arrested?
Patrick: I don't know, he was ever heard from him again. [SpongeBob looks nervous. the police car stops in the middle of nowhere and throws SpongeBob and Patrick out, and then drive away, kicking up dust and blowing away their clothes, leaving them in their underwear]
Police Fish #1: See ya later, longhairs! [drives away]
Patrick and SpongeBob: Bye!
SpongeBob: See you later!
SpongeBob: Thanks for the lift!
SpongeBob: [horrified] They left us, out here in the middle of nowhere!
Patrick: Oh, this isn't the middle of nowhere; We're actually on the edge of nowhere! [points to a sign that says: "Now entering Nowhere. Population: 0]
SpongeBob: [smiles weakly] Well, at least it isn't raining!
[a single small thundercloud in the entire sky starts to pour rain right above where SpongeBob and Patrick are. A scene cuts to a miserable SpongeBob and Patrick sitting in a rain puddle. Rain stops as one of SpongeBob's fliers float by, remotivating him]
SpongeBob: [angrily] I'm not ready to give up just yet!
Patrick: [gleefully] I am!
SpongeBob: If we could just come up with a better way to reach the people, something everyone can see and hear!
Patrick: You mean like a parade?
SpongeBob: Oh a parade! Patrick, how did you come up with such a brilliant idea?
Patrick: [points to the left] There's one going by right there. [shows two fish with a banner saying "Shelly Super Highway"; followed by a marching band; followed by a float and the circus; followed by Santa on a tropical island on a limo; followed by a herd of senior citizens being whipped at by the two wrestlers from Krusty Krushers: followed by a group of Scottish fish playing bagpipes; followed by some clown fish and a cat parade balloon: followed by a choir: and finally followed by a heavy metal rock band].
SpongeBob: That certainly is a parade!
Patrick: [points] Look!
SpongeBob: [gasps at Plankton in a complex paver/bulldozer hybrid following everyone] Plankton! Driving a big tractor! This doesn't look good at all, Patrick.
Patrick: Does this?! [flexes his back]
SpongeBob: C'mon! Let's go follow them! [he follows the parade. Patrick still flexes, the parade stops, and Plankton gets out a loud speaker]
Plankton: People of Bikini Bottom-[crowd starts to murmur and ignore him, until a Scottish fish points at him]
Scottish fish:  Look, up there.
Plankton: Today marks the new- [is cut of again by the crowd] STOP MURMURING! [everyone is silent] Thank you. And as I was saying, today marks the beginning of a new- [is interrupted by the crowd singing, "For He's A Jolly Good Fellow"] [angrily] Shut up! [crowd stop immediately] Today marks a new beginning for Bikini Bottom! [crowd cheers and confetti falls] Now, it’s time to pave our way down the road to success! [starts the paver/bulldozer hybrid while the band plays, and starts to make the highway, which makes all of the jellyfish pack their bags and fly away; he laughs evilly. sniffs the air, and then sighs] Ah, I love the smell of hot tar in the morning! Yeah baby! [stops in front of a matador/band member with his hat covering his face] Hey you there! Are you trying to get yourself crushed!?
[takes off his hat, revealing SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [furious] I won't let you do it, Plankton! If you're going to pave over Jellyfish Fields, you're going to have to pave over me first! [shows he and Plankton dramatically locking eyes, and quickly shows some surprised members of the parade]
Plankton: [simply smiles] Ooh! Your wish is my command, Sponge! [angrily pushes levers forward, crushing SpongeBob. shows SpongeBob crushed, clearly in agony]
SpongeBob: [weakly] Is that all you got? [is then immediately covered in tar; next scene shows the parade continuing, Plankton still paving, the jellyfish moving, and Jellyfish Fields being transformed into a desolate, lifeless wasteland. SpongeBob gets out of a manhole, looking very sad, and sees Patrick playing a trumpet]
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Knock it off, Patrick.
[next scene shows the Shelly Super Highway going through Jellyfish Fields into a severely polluted Bikini Bottom, and shows the graffiti concrete pillars holding up the road arch over the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [miserable] I used to dream of a restaurant that have an "easy highway access!"
SpongeBob: [looks sad too] Yeah, but this is more like "highway excess!"
Squidward: [shows up] Well, I'm going to go soak my tentacles. [shivers] It's cold in here under all this concrete!
Mr. Krabs: [looks hopeful] But Squidward, we can't leave! What if we have, a customer?
Squidward: [sarcastically] Really. We haven't had a customer since the day this highway was built!
SpongeBob: [sheepishly] uh, Squidward, it's technically its a super-highway.
Squidward: [angrily] I don't care what it is! I'm out of here!
SpongeBob: [shocked] But Squidward- [is interrupted by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [looks sad] No, no SpongeBob. Squidward's right. [gets up and walks to his office] I think it's high time we started accepting facts. [SpongeBob runs over to a fax machine and pulls out a new one]
SpongeBob: [smiles] I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [annoyed] No boyo! Not that kind!
SpongeBob: [confused] Mr. Krabs, what are you saying?
Mr. Krabs: [darkly] The Krusty Krab can't stay in business. Not like this.
SpongeBob: It can't?
Mr. Krabs: No SpongeBob. It's time to activate Plan Zed-9er9er.
SpongeBob: Zed-9er9er!? [is horrified, and his eyes nearly shoots out of his head, and faints landing in Squidward's hands]
Squidward: Eugene, what is plan Zed-9er9er!? And more importantly, how does it affect me!?
Mr. Krabs: Plan Zed-9er9er is, [Truck passes over] I'm-[is interrupted by traffic honking and driving] I'm-[is interrupted again, and than yells quickly during next honks] I'm selling the Krabby Patty secret formula to Plankton!
Squidward: [shocked] Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: [sadly] I have no choice. And stop calling me Eugene. [walks out of Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Tell me I'm dreaming! [moans]
Squidward: [looks sad] Not this time, little fella. [sniffles. It shows Mr. Krabs outside, and changes the "Open" sign to say "Closed" as he sobs. Cut to the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is rich, successful, and getting a back massage from Karen, via an electric plug]
Plankton: Uh, lower, a little lower, yeah, that's it! [doorbell hang rang, and Plankton rides to the door on a segway] Now who could that be during my hour of triumph? [shows a miserable Mr. Krabs holding the Secret Formula] How appropriate. [snickers]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, I'm ready to negotiate a price for me secret formula.
Plankton: Oh, goody! [gets out a large pocketwatch] Let me just wind my watch!
Mr. Krabs: [very sad] What for?
Plankton: [gleefully] 'Cause I'm gonna love every minute of this! [a faint buzzing is heard] Did you hear that? Karen is that you?
Mr. Krabs: [points up to a vent] Up there! [a massive amount of jellyfish come out of it] Whoa nelly!
SpongeBob: [outside] First I lost Jellyfish Fields, and- and......
Squidward: And what?
SpongeBob: [in a sobbing mess] And now I lost the only job I ever wanted! [cries]
Squidward: Look at it this way, I don't have to see you every day now! Ha this could be the start of something beautiful! [a jellyfish stings him] OW! What in the name of-!
SpongeBob: [gleefully]Squidward Look!
Squidward: What am I looking- [screams]
SpongeBob: All the jellyfish who used to live in Jellyfish Fields are coming to Bikini Bottom!
Squidward: Yeah, but for some reason, I don't think it's to distribute holiday gift baskets!
SpongeBob: Aw, ya don't? [Both run away as the town turns into chaos]
Mr. Krabs: [back in the Chum Bucket] Uh. You know, Plankton? Let's just talk about this later. I think I'm just gonna run for me life.[runs out the door, closing it behind him]
Plankton: [horrified] Wait! I'm coming with you! [before Plankton can escape, the jellyfish grab him] Nooooo! [jellyfish sting him] Not the eye! Not the eye!
Ben: Chaos runs rampid in Bikini Bottom. [ducks down from jellyfish] That's right folks, this is news reporter, Ben Blenny standing in for Perch Perkins who's out today with a terrible case of indigestion, and we are coming to you live during day 3 of what appears to be Bikini Bottom's worst-
Bill: Am I on television?
Ben: Yes sir, you are, would you care to say a few words about the-
Bill: [grabs the mike] Hi, Mom, hi, Dad. Hey, Dr. Slieen. [SpongeBob is seen running away from jellyfish in the background] Hey, Jennifer, hey, Sally, hey, Francis, hey, Mable, [Ben's face turns into an annoyed look] hey, Julie, hey, Abigail.
SpongeBob: [panting still running then notices the News] Ah! Now they'll have to listen! [runs to Ben and Bill]
Bill: And there's my pals in El Tuna, and the gang at the Pudgy Flipper... [Ben pushes him away]
Ben: Uh, thank you. [SpongeBob skids in] Hello, little boy, how about saying a few words into the camera about the current crisis?
SpongeBob: Well, okay, I guess. Sorry I am a little nervous.
Ben: That's understandable, just speak loud and clear.
SpongeBob: Well, all I have to say is that, um, well, [yells] Stop the madness! We need to get Jellyfish Fields back to the jellyfish, which will restore their natural habitat, so they will be in peace. And balance will once again restore to their natural land. So what do you say everybody, will you help me?
Everybody: No!
SpongeBob: [confused] You're kidding, right?
Everybody: Yes!
SpongeBob: Well all right! Everybody, follow me.
[Everybody runs over the cameraman to Jellyfish Fields.. The scene cuts to SpongeBob in the tractor ready to tear down the Shelly Superhighway]
SpongeBob: Okay everyone, say goodbye to the worst thing that's happened to this town since 97 cent stores.
Everyone: Yeah! [SpongeBob tries to break the highway with the tractor, but it just stopped!]
Plankton: Good effort, Spongedope, but you can't tear up my highway, it's indestructible!
Larry Lobster: Not if we have anything to do with it!
SpongeBob: Larry Lobster!
Larry: That's right pal, but that's not all. [Sandy walks out from the crowd, waving]
SpongeBob: Sandy Squirrel! [Mrs. Puff walks out of the crowd]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff! [Mermaid Man &amp; Barnacle Boy both walk out from the crowd]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man &amp; Barnacle Boy! [Patrick walks walk out from the crowd]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Su-Su-Su-Su!
SpongeBob: And Squidward! [Squidward doesn't walk out from the crowd]
Fish 3: Nope, that's everybody!
Larry: Push!
Larry: Harder!
SpongeBob: Harder still!
Fish 3: You heard the little square guy, yeah! [Everybody lines up behind the tractor and pushes it]
Plankton: Wait! I didn't count on all of you working together! [Everybody pushes hard enough that the highway breaks!]
Plankton: My highway! Stop, you can't! [Plankton gets crushed by the tractor!]
Everyone: Yeah! [The arch over the Krusty Krab breaks down in a pile of dust and the smog clears]
Mr. Krabs: Praise Neptune.
SpongeBob: Jelly lelly lelly leely, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jelly fishing song!
Jellyfish: Clap!
SpongeBob: Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, everyone sing along!
Jellyfish: Clap!
Everyone: Jelly lelly lelly leely, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jelly fishing song!
Jellyfish: Clap!
Everyone: Jelly lelly lelly leely, jelly lelly lelly jelly everyone siiiiinnnnggggg! [The camera zooms out and we cut to the Jellyfish Fields ranger]
Ranger: [bored voice] Everyone sing along. [He switches the "closed" sign to "open," and then walks away]

 
[A shadow that looks like Plankton walks up to the Krusty Krab and gets inside using the code. He goes back into Mr. Krabs' office and opens up the safe and gets out the formula. SpongeBob turns on the lights to reveal the shadow is Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: What are you doing, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Just making sure the Krabby Patty formula is safe. [he points to a calendar] Plankton hasn't tried stealing the formula in over a month. He must be planning something big.
Squidward: [walks in] Hello.
Mr. Krabs: One of you will have to volunteer for some extra work.
Squidward: [walks out] Goodbye.
Mr. Krabs: I was just gonna ask if someone can spy on Plankton.
SpongeBob: Spy?! Whoo-ooh-ooh! [acts like James Bond]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, I can see you through this straw.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm going to be a spy.
Patrick: You're a spy?! [cuts to outside of the Krusty Krab as it rocks back and forth] I wanna be a spy, too!
Mr. Krabs: [back inside] Shh! Okay, okay! You can be a spy. Just be quiet.
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Hooray! We're spy buddies!! [Mr. Krabs stammers]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: [whispering] Spy buddies.
Mr. Krabs: Your instructions are on this Krabby Patty. But remember, the fate of the Krusty Krab rests in your hands, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: In my hands? [he looks at his hands] Ooh...
Patrick: [he grabs SpongeBob's hand and looks at it] Ooh. [cut to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob pushes the button on the patty]
Mr. Krabs: Your mission - if you choose to accept it - is to discover what Plankton's up to. Don't let him out of your sight. You'll need to rustle up some spy gadgets. If you don't accept it, you're fired! This patty will self-destruct in 10 seconds. [while the patty is beeping, both scream and run in circles]
SpongeBob: Get rid of it! Get rid of it, Patrick! [Patrick puts the patty in his pants. They both cover their ears. The patty explodes and leaves the bottom half of Patrick's body without any skin. The walls in SpongeBob's pineapple get fried, and they turn into a greenish color]
Patrick: That's gonna leave a mark. [Patrick pulls up his pants. Cuts to Sandy's treedome]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy.
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob, Patrick. What y'all doing?
SpongeBob: Do you know anything about spying, Sandy?
Sandy: Well, I know you need a lot of crazy gadgets, like jet-packs, and laser-equipped Bermuda shorts with walkie-talkies...
Man on Walkie Talkie: 10-4, good buddy. [static]
Sandy: Cameras that fit up your nose, high-powered magnifying glasses. [a gross close-up of SpongeBob and Patrick's gory faces on the magnifying glass' POV] And my favorite, the knockout ray. [blasts SpongeBob and Patrick with it causes them to knockout. Then blasts them again making them wake up]
SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy, with these gadgets, Patrick and I will be great spies!
Sandy: [laughs] I wouldn't trust you two with any of this stuff! [continues laughing]
SpongeBob: What do we do now, Patrick? [Patrick picks up the knockout ray and knocks Sandy out. Both laugh. Cut to the city where SpongeBob and Patrick are spying from the side of a building]
Patrick: What's he doing now?
SpongeBob: Nothing yet. Wait! Wait!! He's... [Plankton walks into "Guppies R Us"] ...buying baby clothes? We gotta get closer.
Plankton: [walking up to an employee] Excuse me?! [holds up a small pink outfit] Do you have anything in a size negative five?
Employee: [laughs] Sorry, bud, that's as small as they come. [He takes the outfit. Plankton sighs and walks away. SpongeBob enlarges himself in the clothes on the wall]
SpongeBob: Wow, Plankton has to buy baby clothes? [Patrick enlarges himself in the outfit next to SpongeBob]
Patrick: How embarrassing? [Plankton walks out of "Guppies R Us". SpongeBob walks out a couple seconds later]
SpongeBob: SpongeBob to Krabs. Come in Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Krabs here. Go ahead.
SpongeBob: Plankton just bought some baby clothes.
Mr. Krabs: Baby clothes? [writes 'baby clothes' on the chalkboard] Hmm... What's he doing now?
SpongeBob: Hold on. [looks through store window] He's buying...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah? Yeah?
SpongeBob: A... stamp.
Mr. Krabs: A stamp. [writes 'stamp' on the chalkboard] This is the most elaborate scheme ever. Keep on him, SpongeBob. [cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are tip-toeing behind Plankton]
SpongeBob: We're right behind him, and he has no idea! [from Plankton's POV, the tip-toes are thunderous steps. He turns around]
Plankton: Grrrr, would you stop making all that racket!? [from SpongeBob and Patrick's POV, Plankton is squeaking as he talks so they can't understand him]
Patrick: What's he doing now?
SpongeBob: I can't tell. [they walk again but SpongeBob is shining a light on Plankton from the magnifying glass]
Plankton: Whew! Gosh, it's hot. [catches on fire and runs off] Yahhhh!!!
SpongeBob: He's getting away! Quick, Patrick, use the jet-pack!
Patrick: Can do! [pushes a button and Patrick grabs SpongeBob as they fly toward Plankton. Plankton jumps into a soda drink and puts himself out]
Plankton: Whew... huh? [SpongeBob and Patrick fly over Plankton, screaming, setting him and the cup on fire, while they fly through buildings, causing damage. The jet-pack detaches itself from Patrick and they both skid on the sidewalk. When they stand up, their faces and bodies are deformed]
SpongeBob: Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke our fall. But we've lost Plankton!
Patrick: To the spy mobile!! [both hop into the car]
SpongeBob: Hmmm... mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield...
Patrick: Self destruct! [stupidly pushes the "SELF DESTRUCT" button and the car explodes. Both laugh. Patrick's pants phone is ringing] There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone.
Mr. Krabs: Krabs to Agent SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.
Patrick: It's for you.
SpongeBob: Agent SpongeBob here.
Mr. Krabs: You found out what Plankton's up to?
SpongeBob: I'm afraid we've lost him, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, find him, lad; I'm not paying you to goof off with Patrick!
SpongeBob: You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Exactly. So get to work. [hangs up]
Recording: If you'd like to make a call, please deposit 25 cents. [SpongeBob gets out a quarter. Cut to the Chum Bucket at night. SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, we're in position. Now how do we get inside?
Patrick: I think the front door's open.
SpongeBob: Spies don't use the front door, Patrick. We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside.
Patrick: This looks like a job for Patrick Star Laser Pants! [shoots a laser out of his behind and cuts out a square on the roof]
SpongeBob: Good work, Patrick! Now it's my turn! [drops down inside, with the rope tied around him. He lowers himself but hits the floor] I thought you were holding the rope -- [Patrick lands on top of him]
Patrick: I am! You need to be quiet. We're on a secret mission!
Plankton: [turns on the lights] Secret mission, eh?! [they both scream and hold each other] Don't you think I know what you're up to? You want to eat at the Chum Bucket without your boss knowing. Karen, we've got a customer! [SpongeBob and Patrick are now seated at a table] I'll let you two look over the menu. [jumps off the table and walks off]
Patrick: [nervously] SpongeBob, I have to go.
SpongeBob: Ohhh, can't you go later?
Patrick: [groans] My laser pants aren't working right. [shoots a laser at the salt shaker on the other table. It vanishes. Patrick sighs]
Plankton: [shows up] Could I interest you in a raspberry iced tea?
Patrick: Uh, no thanks...
Plankton: Or perhaps a bran muffin?
Patrick: SpongeBob! I have to go now!!
Plankton: Prune Danish? [sees Patrick's behind wiggle] What the--?! [pan out to the Chum Bucket building where Patrick's laser pants makes holes everywhere as they all scream and destroys the Chum Bucket. Later, the floor opens up and a blimp emerges with Plankton controlling it from the inside] Destroy my lab, will ya, Krabs? Well, if it's war you want, it's war you'll get! [flies his blimp over to the Krusty Krab. The inside of the Krusty Krab gets darker]
Mr. Krabs: Why's it dark? I think I put off my cataract surgery too long.
Squidward: No, Mr. Krabs, it's that time of the month.
Mr. Krabs: [sees the blimp] Merciful Neptune! [red light flashes] Man your battle stations!
Squidward: I'm on it! [runs into the bathroom and flushes a toilet]
Mr. Krabs: [raises himself in the crow's nest] Bring it on, Plankton!
Plankton: Oh, I will! We'll see if you have any customers left after I pump up the volume! [loud music starts playing. All the customers cover their ears]
Nat: Oh, brother, I hated the real version of this song. [the Krusty Krab customers start to leave]
Mr. Krabs: He's driving me customers away! All right, Plankton, you want my customers so badly? [he presses a button, a vacuum comes out and sucks up all the customers] You can have 'em! [he launches the customers through a cannon aimed at the blimp]
Plankton: [as customers hit the blimp] Do your worst, Krabs!
Squidward: [hits the blimp] I hate my job. [he slides down]
SpongeBob: [watching from the top of the blimp] It's up to you and me, buddy!
Patrick: Abandon ship! [Patrick jumps off the blimp] NOOO! AAHHH! [he lands in the cannon and is blasted back toward the blimp]
Plankton: Pointy-headed projectile on the port side! [Patrick makes a hole in the blimp, causing it to fly around]
Mr. Krabs: Heh-heh-heh! Huh? [gasps as the blimp, now on fire, is falling down to the Krusty Krab] NOO!!! [the blimp destroys the Krusty Krab]
Plankton: [standing on the Krusty Krab sign with a piece of paper in his hand] I win! I ALWAYS WIN! [evil laugh]
SpongeBob: Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose.
Plankton: No, SpongeBob, I always... [he grabs his head and rips it off, turning into Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: ...win!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs?!
Mr. Krabs: [jumps off the sign] That's right! [he rips the body of Plankton's disguise off] I stole me own formuler!
SpongeBob: But if you're Mr. Krabs, then who's... [the other Mr. Krabs rips off his suit to show the Robot Krabs from "Imitation Krabs"] Mr. Krabs is a robot! [Robot Krabs opens its head up to reveal Plankton]
Plankton: No, you idiot.
SpongeBob: Plankton?! What the barnacles is going on here!?
Mr. Krabs: You see, we had a bet. Plankton's been trying for twenty years to steal me formula, and he's never done it.
Plankton: I almost had it thirty-seven times, and you know it!
Mr. Krabs: [shows his claw at Plankton] Tell it to the claw, sister. Last time he failed, we made a bet. [flashback to Mr. Krabs laughing while Plankton is crying on the ground] You can't beat me, Plankton. I always win!
Plankton: [he stops crying] You've got the easy part. I'd like to see you do my job.
Mr. Krabs: [he picks Plankton up] Oh, yeah, right. If I was you, I could steal me formula on me first try.
Plankton: Ha! The usual wager?
Mr. Krabs: You're on. [flashback ends] So, through a series of events far too elaborate to go into right now, we flawlessly assumed each other's lives; and I beat Plankton at his own game... [points at the destroyed Chum Bucket] and destroyed his place of business! [laughs] Now pay up.
Plankton: Here you go, Eugene. [takes out a dollar] One a-dollar.
Patrick: Not so fast! [rips his bodysuit off to reveal Squidward]
SpongeBob: Squidward! [to the other Squidward] Then-then who are you!?
Squidward: I'm not... [SpongeBob tears off his face, revealing facial muscles] wearing a disguise! [he puts his face back on and walks away]
SpongeBob: Hmmm, if he's Squidward, then you must be... [fake Squidward rips off his suit to reveal Sandy] Sandy?!
Sandy: Whoops, wrong outfit! [rips off bodysuit to reveal another SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're me! Then I must be... [rips off his suit to reveal Patrick]
Patrick: Patrick!
SpongeBob: Nah, I'm just kidding. [rips off the SpongeBob suit and reveals another Patrick]
Patrick: I really am Patrick! [laughs. The other Patrick rips off his bodysuit to reveal SpongeBob again]
SpongeBob: Good one, Patrick! [both laugh] There's just one thing I don't understand...
Mr. Krabs: What's that, laddie?
SpongeBob: That. [points to two Patrick's laughing beside each other.]


[episode starts in a field with the clams flying. Squidward is shown to have two clouds with a rainbow over his head, bordered by many jellyfish]
Squidward: My, what a beautiful day it is outside. [scene switches to Krusty Krab] Too bad I'm cooped up here in the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Who are you talking to, Squidward?
Squidward: Just like I always seem to be on a nice sunny day.
SpongeBob: Look at it this way, Squidward: Things could always be worse.
Squidward: Worse? How?
SpongeBob: Well, uh...
[fish walks by and sneezes all over a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Uh...you could be sick.
Squidward: Sick? Is that really any worse?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Being sick is awful! The aches, the running nose, and the fever are bad enough. But that's not even the worst part.
Squidward: Oh, really.
SpongeBob: No. The worst part is missing a glorious shift here at the Krusty Krab.
[the words "Krusty Krab" echo in Squidward's head]
SpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward? Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? Oh, SpongeBob. I'm suddenly not feeling very well. [inadequately coughs]
SpongeBob: What's the matter?
Squidward: Well, Uh. Let's see. Uh. I got a scratchy throat and, uh, [sticks out tongue] dry mouth, and my, um, uh, my eyes are itchy. [scratches left eye vigorously]
SpongeBob: Squidward, what could it be?
Squidward: I'm not sure. But I fear I might be coming down with a dreaded illness.
SpongeBob: Ah! What is the name of this horrible illness?
Squidward: Name? Oh, uh. Per, swees, swer, squeer, uh, squid's disease.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Squid's disease.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Squid's disease!
SpongeBob: [he gasps] Squidward. I think the disease is affecting your temper.
Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob. [camera pans to find SpongeBob hiding behind three pillows] What are you doing back there?
SpongeBob: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Squidward, but I think the best thing for somebody in your condition would be to [gulps] go home and not come back until you're fully recovered.
Squidward: Well, SpongeBob, [stutters] I think you're probably right.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] I'm so sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: Well, I, I better go break the news to Mr. Krabs. [inadequately coughs again]
Mr. Krabs: You're sick?!
Squidward: [inadequately coughs]
Mr. Krabs: Well, you don't look any sicker than you usually do. [Squidward frowns] You know what. I better give you the old navy onceover just to be sure.
Squidward: The what?
[Mr. Krabs lifts Squidward's nose]
Mr. Krabs: Now open wide.
[Squidward opens his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls out tongue] Tongue looks fine. [lets it go, opens left eyelid] Eyes, check. [knocks on Squidward's forehead]
Squidward: Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Forehead feels normal. [lifts two of Squidward's legs] Now let's see those kneecaps. [hits kneecaps, causing Squidward's legs to slowly bend upward and then back downward] Reflexes are a little slow. But I'd expect that from you.
Squidward: Wonderful.
Mr. Krabs: Well, Mr. Squidward, in my expert opinion, you look fit as a fiddle.
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: [slams fist on desk] Mr. Krabs nothing.
Squidward: But I...
Mr. Krabs: [slams fist on desk again] Mr. Krabs nothing!
Squidward: But...
Mr. Krabs: [slams fist on desk again] Mr. Krabs nothing! Just go ahead. I'm gonna keep sayin' it.
Squidward: And what about the customers? You don't want them to get sick, do you?
Mr. Krabs: No. And I don't want them to get hungry either. [pushes Squidward out of office] So step to it, Mr. Squidward. Oh yeah, and get well soon. [laughs and shuts door]
Squidward: [sighs. fish speak among each other in cash register line]
Squidward: [takes bill from fish] SpongeBob, would you bring that order to table 3, puh-lease?
SpongeBob: [muffled] Right away, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob. [SpongeBob halts] Turn around, please.
SpongeBob: [turns around and appears to be wearing a gas mask] Yes. [heavy breathing]
Squidward: And just what is that supposed to be?
SpongeBob: Oh, this. It's a number 2: Krabby Patty with cheese, medium drink...
Squidward: Not that. Not that. The thing on your face.
SpongeBob: [points to his gas mask] Oh, this.
Squidward: Yes.
SpongeBob: Oh, this is a precautionary measure in case should anyone in the workplace happens to fall ill, which in this case you have. Then I wear it to protect my body from spreading germs and bacterias.
Squidward: [appears in front of SpongeBob, and lets out a breath, stretching his words] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hello, Squidward.
Squidward: Could I see that?
SpongeBob: Um, actually no.
Squidward: Because I find this all so very inte... [sneezes into nose of mask] ...resting.
[SpongeBob takes off mask, screams, and runs into Mr. Krabs' office]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Neptune's Knee-highs, lad! How many times do I have to remind you to knock?!
SpongeBob: [knocks on door while speaking] Mis...ter...Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: That's better. Now what can I do you for?
SpongeBob: It's Squidward. He's sick.
Mr. Krabs: That's funny. You're the second person today whose told me that.
SpongeBob: Who was the first?
Mr. Krabs: Squidward. But I checked out that slimy green cashier personally, and if he's sick, then I'm the next mayor of Marmalade Mountain. [lowers his voice and ponders] Doesn't sound like a bad gig actually.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, you have to believe me. Squidward's got a horrible disease called Squid's Disease! Scratchy throat, itchy eyes, dry mouth, fevers, and boils, and missed workdays! [panics and falls to the floor]
Fish: One Krabby Patty, please.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, got a minute?
Squidward: Oh, of course. It's not like I'm busy working or anything.
Mr. Krabs: [leans in] We've got a situation with the kid. Something's got him spooked.
[SpongeBob is shown holding his nose and mouth tightly]
Mr. Krabs: He can't cook in this condition. No cookin, no patties. No patties, no money.
Squidward: And you're telling me this, why?
Mr. Krabs: I need you to make yourself scarce for a while.
Squidward: So, you're telling me to go home?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't care where you go, just as long as you get outta here!
Squidward: Yippee! Thanks, Mr. Krabs! I mean [inadequately coughs]
SpongeBob: Poor Squidward.
[in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is... [scratches right eye] My favorite thing about Krabby Patties is... [scratches eye once again] That's funny. My eyes feel itchy. [pauses, coughs] And my throat feels scratchy, too. [laughs, drops spatula worriedly] Itchy eyes, scratchy throat... [rubs tongue only for smoke to come off and gasps, hoarsely] Even my mouth feels dry! [normal] I've contracted... Squid's Disease! [yells]
Mr. Krabs: [barges into kitchen] SpongeBob, everything all right in here?
SpongeBob: Everything's fine, captain. Just a little, uh, howl for pleasure.
Mr. Krabs: Well, how about a little less pleasure and a little more work? [shuts the door]
SpongeBob: [to himself] If Mr. Krabs finds out I have the Squid's Disease, he'll send me home, just like Squidward. Wait a second! That's it! Why go home when I have Grandma's down home folk remedies right here? [fills pot with water] Grandma always said: 'If you might be coming down with an illness, just stick your feet in hot water.' [places feet into water] Or was it cold water? [places feet into ice. Shivers] Something tells me it wasn't that either. Of course! It wasn't hot water or cold water! It was boiling oil! [places feet into fryer] Uh-huh. I can definitely feel the medicinal qualities. [takes feet out, fried to a crisp] Oh no!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You sure everything's alright?
SpongeBob: [places feet and legs back into boiling oil] Yes, everything's fine in here. [Mr. Krabs shuts door] Just dandy. [takes feet and legs back out] I better conceal these unslightly blemishes or Mr. Krabs will get suspicious. [smears liquid onto right leg] This super hot spicy yellow mustard will do the trick. Well no, actually that burns real bad. [worriedly] Stay calm. Just need to cool it off. Cucumber! Cucumber will cool it off! We'll just need to find some— [holds up pickle jar] pickles! Pickles are like cucumbers. Sweet relief, here I come. [pours all the juice and the pickles onto legs, sigh of relief turns into loud screams of pain] Sweet vinegar, it burns! It burns! It burns! [crashes into trash bin and mop. Rolls into more trash bins. Customers listen to racket]
Frankie Billy: Do you guys hear what's going on?
Harold: Yes, and I'm very puzzled.
Nat Peterson: So am I, in fact, I might even be a little concerned.
Harold: Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.
[SpongeBob comes out of kitchen with trash covering him; crawls in front of Frankie Billy, Harold, and Nat Peterson and then lies on side]
SpongeBob: Sorry, I think I might be coming down with something.
Harold: Coming down with something?
Nat: I refuse to be served by a sick fry cook.
Harold: Me too. Let's get outta here!
Frankie Billy: Good idea!
[fish banter while two other fish march out of restaurant]
Mr. Krabs:  [gasps] Me customers! [looks at SpongeBob lying on back now and gasps] You look terrible.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Krabs. [coughs]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't just stand by while me restaurant becomes a breeding ground for infection. SpongeBob, go home. That's an order!
SpongeBob: But who's going to run the restaurant?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Who's gonna run it? I could run this place blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back. I'll show ya.
[scene cuts to Squidward's house]
Squidward: [appears to be resting on a chair with the radio on. sighs] Who thought that having an illness could feel so good? [drinks beverage]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. [Squidward spits out drinks]
Squidward: Oh, no! What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I... fell ill. Mr. Krabs won't let me work again until I'm better. Well, at least we can spend the day recovering together. After all, misery loves company. Right, Squidward? [coughs. Squidward appears to have disappeared] Squidward?
[inside Squidward's house]
Squidward: Well, so much for enjoying the great outdoors. But at least I can relax and enjoy [sighs] some afternoon tea.
SpongeBob: That sounds like a great idea, Squidward!
Squidward: [drops tea and screams] SpongeBob, what have I told you about coming into my house?
SpongeBob: I figured I can't make you well, Squidward, but I can at least make you comfortable. I brought hot compresses, tissues, the good kind with snail butter, and even a romantic comedy for us to watch. I know they're supposed to be funny, but they always make me cry.
[in the Krusty Krab, the customers are in a riot]
Mr. Krabs: 25 Krabby Patties! [leaps into kitchen and sprints out with Krabby Patties. Throws food randomly] Order up! Order up! Order up!
Henry: Hey, I didn't order a table patty! [Krabby Patty appears to be splattered on table]
Shubie: Yeah, or a window patty!
Fish 3: Or a face patty! I want a refund!
[fish start riot yelling refund. In Squidward's house]
Television: Female: I love you Ted. Male: Ditto. [both engage in laughing]
SpongeBob: [seen crying and blows into tissue] Wasn't that great, Squidward?
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, yeah, howdy. That's too bad it had to end. Finally.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry. We have all 99 sequels to watch next.
Squidward: Oh, would you look at that. I'm suddenly feeling much, much better. I think I'm going back to work now, bye. [rushes out house back to work being followed by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward, wait! Squidward! You're not well enough to return to work! I can't let you!
Squidward: Please just stop! Stop following me!
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
SpongeBob and Squidward: [both gasp] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [appears to be lying on ground with mustard and buns covering him] I told you. I could run this place all by myself. Blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here lying on the floor?
Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, funny you should ask. Because in me expert medical opinion, I think I may be coming down with a nasty case of Squid's Disease.
SpongeBob: Squid's Disease? I know just the cure! [holds up romantic comedy tape]
Mr. Krabs: Romantic Comedy?! No! [crawls away] Ahh! Get that thing away from me!


[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office with an adding machine, singing.]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profit will make me wallet fat!♪
[His eyes bug out at the ticker tape]
Mr. Krabs: What?! Profits down three dollars from last month! I got to start running a tighter ship around here!
[Meanwhile, Squidward is helping Martha in his ordering boat at the dining area of the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab. Here's your change.
[Gives Martha a dollar, and she walks off. Mr. Krabs approaches him.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: What's with all this "change" nonsense?
[SpongeBob walks over, knotting his tie.]
SpongeBob: Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up! [Squidward becomes exasperated, and sighs deeply] Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe.
Squidward: You hardly pay us at all.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you.
[He hands his employees envelopes.]
Squidward: Ah, yes! Our meager restitution. [He takes the envelope and smells it] Ah, the sweet smell of payday. [He opens it and finds a pair of underwear] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning. [Trades envelopes with him] Here's your check.
[He gives SpongeBob an envelope as well.]
Mr. Krabs: And here's yours, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs. [Holds up his spatula] Grilling is my passion.
[Mr. Krabs greedily takes the envelope back]
Squidward: What is this!?! [He sees that there is a bill instead of a check. It charges Squidward for breathing, talking, standing, existing, lollygagging, and chewing] You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?
Mr. Krabs: There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it.
[SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, preparing money for him]
SpongeBob: 18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe. [Mr. Krabs is drooling over SpongeBob's cash, and Squidward pulls SpongeBob towards him]
Squidward: Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob: I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him.
Squidward: Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same.
SpongeBob: Why?
Squidward: We've got to unite as workers and demand the respect we deserve from the boss! In fact, you and I should go on strike!
SpongeBob: Wow! You and me go on strike?
Squidward: Sure! After all, you like your job, right?
SpongeBob: Right!
Squidward: And you want to keep working here, right?
SpongeBob: Right!
Squidward: And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?
SpongeBob: Right!
Squidward: Then let's go on strike!
SpongeBob: Yay! A strike! [He starts to sing excitedly] ♪Goin' on a strike! We’re goin' on a strike!♪ I still don't know what a strike means. ♪But we're goin' on a strike!♪ [He inadvertently kicks Mr. Krabs in the butt as Krabs sweeps the floor] Hey, guess what, Mr. Krabs? Me and Squidward are going to go on strike!
Mr. Krabs: A strike?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: You mean you're going to make picket signs?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And you're going to make protest speeches?
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah!
Mr. Krabs: And you're going to demand me respect?
SpongeBob: Yeah! [Cut to SpongeBob sobbing outside of the Krusty Krab] Noo... [Squidward is with him] No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was gonna get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I... [He cries more] Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm gonna be sick.
Squidward: SpongeBob! [He grabs SpongeBob and pulls him off the door, but his arms and legs stick] News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too! [SpongeBob is suctioned to the door. Squidward pulls him off again, and this time his face remains pressed against the door] This is exactly why we need to go on strike. [SpongeBob flies back to the door. Squidward pulls him off once more, and this time SpongeBob's front sticks to the door, and we can see his skeleton and internal organs on his other side] He can't treat us like this anymore! [SpongeBob goes back to the door and Squidward's eyes become bloodshot] He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap. [SpongeBob and Squidward look through the door to see Mr. Krabs blowing dust off his old "Help Wanted" sign] Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united! [SpongeBob holds Squidward's hand] Ahem.
SpongeBob: [withdraws his hand] Sorry.
Squidward: Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time, you'll have your job back and more.
SpongeBob: And more?
[He imagines himself in his Krusty Krew uniform hat, except his hat is much bigger]
Squidward: Alright, SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms, [He takes off his hat] they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so. [Squidward throws it into the ground and stomps on it] Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob hesitantly takes his hat off] That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground.
[SpongeBob attempts to do so, but the hat sticks to his hand like gum.]
SpongeBob: [wails] I can't do it, Squidward! This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me.
Squidward: SpongeBob, you're pathetic! Look, I threw my hat to the ground.
[A police fish walks up to Squidward with a ticket]
Officer John: Aha! A confession! Next time, think before you litter.
[He sticks the ticket to Squidward's forehead and leaves. Later, Squidward and SpongeBob are painting signs]
Squidward: Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking.
[SpongeBob holds up a picket fence on a stick]
SpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?
Squidward: Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!
[SpongeBob holds up a sign that has a finger picking his nose]
SpongeBob: How's this?
Squidward: ...No. [Picks up his] This is a picket sign: Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point. [SpongeBob holds up his similar one that reads "Krusty Krab Funfair"]
SpongeBob: How about this, Squidward?
Squidward: SpongeBob, it's "unfair," not "funfair"!
[A fish walks by]
Sandals: A funfair? Where? I could go for some fun.
SpongeBob: At the Krusty Krab.
Sandals: Hey, everybody! Let's go to the fun fair! [A crowd of fish trample Squidward to get the restaurant. Later, SpongeBob is holding a sign that says "No Fair!" on it]
SpongeBob: Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!
[A teenager fish with a cap and braces walks up]
Teenage Fry Cook: What the heck does that mean?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.
Teenage Fry Cook: Then you must be SpongeBob SquarePants!
SpongeBob: Yep!
Teenage Fry Cook: Dude, you are like a fry cook legend! Will you sign my spatula?
[He pulls out a pen]
SpongeBob: Anything for an aspiring fry cook. [SpongeBob signs the spatula] So, did you come down to help out the cause?
Teenage Fry Cook: No, I came to take your job.
[SpongeBob is shocked. The fish grabs his spatula and pen and runs into the Krusty Krab to apply for a job]
Teenage Fry Cook: Hey, thanks, dude!
[Squidward walks up and bellows at SpongeBob through the megaphone so loudly that his facial features fall off, and he flies away.]
Squidward: Attention, SpongeBob! You are a terrible striker! [SpongeBob inserts his eyes into their sockets] You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward. [He holds up a sign reading, "I Heart the Krusty Krab"] How about I try the signs again?
Squidward: [into megaphone] Forget the signs! I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.
[SpongeBob stands next to a telephone pole.]
SpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?
Squidward: Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect. [We see that SpongeBob is now hidden behind the telephone pole. As Squidward begins to speaks, a crowd gathers] Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!
Miss Shell: I knew it!
[She slaps Dennis]
Squidward: The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr. Krabs!
[The crowd cheers]
Archie: Hey, what's that guy talking about?
Francis: I don't know, but he's got a megaphone.
Squidward: We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity!
[The crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: [From behind pole] Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing.
Squidward: With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!
[He speaks into Fred's face, and his eyes shoot into the back of his head. Then, they return to their sockets. Everyone cheers.]
Billy (lime fish): Wow, all this supporting is making me hungry.
Sandals: Hey, everybody! Let's go get a Krabby Patty.
[Everyone cheers and run into the Krusty Krab, once again trampling Squidward.]
Squidward: Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification.
[SpongeBob walks up to him.]
SpongeBob: That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands.
Mr. Krabs: But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!
SpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... um... Squidward, what was that other part?
Squidward: Dismantle your oppressive establishment?
SpongeBob: Yeah, that, too!
[Mr. Krabs pretends to yawn and leaves]
SpongeBob: And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!
[Squidward's eyes become bloodshot. SpongeBob's voice echoes "forever" in Squidward's mind as he opens the door to his house, takes a bath, looks in the mirror, and sits in bed, wide-eyed. He seems to have a case of insomnia as the word haunts him.]
Squidward: On strike with SpongeBob... forever?! [He imagines himself as an old man with a white beard holding a sign reading, "Krusty Still Unfair." Cobwebs branch from him to the ground. An old SpongeBob approaches him, supported by a cane]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day. [tugs Squidward's beard] Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward? [bonks Squidward on the head with his cane] Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward? [floats around Squidward] Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?
[Back to reality as Squidward lies in bed screaming.]
Squidward: I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!
[He runs to the door and opens it, and Krabs is there in his nightclothes, about to knock on it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy. [He grovels at Squidward's feet] The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone! [The teenagers appear right outside the door]
Teenagers: Alright, Mr. Krabs! [They give him the thumbs up]
Mr. Krabs: See what I mean? [sobbing] Squidward, please! You gotta come back!
Squidward: You'll give us anything we want?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms?
Mr. Krabs: I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.
[Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's pineapple house, where he sits on his bed listening to a country record]
SpongeBob: Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action! [He kicks open his front door, hammer and saw in hand. He runs to the Krusty Krab and into the dining room] I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board! [He pulls up a loose floorboard. He then saws a table in half] I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business! [He takes a bite out of a wooden column. Mouth full] Squidward will be so proud!
[Cut to Squidward and Krabs, now fully dressed, walking to the Krusty Krab at dawn.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations.
Squidward: I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!
[Squidward sees a disassembled Krusty Krab and screams. Krabs seems not to notice and hums as he puts his key where the door used to be, unlocking nothing. SpongeBob peeks out from the mangled sign pole. He runs out, trying to hold in his laughter.]
Squidward: S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?
SpongeBob: I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure.
[Krabs walks through the rubble of the Krusty Krab, oblivious, and sits in his chair. Only then, does he see the debris. Only the floor and base of the walls remain, so when he looks straight ahead from his chair, he can see Squidward and SpongeBob at the dilapidated door frame. Krabs' arms pop off followed by his eyes. His head slides off his torso and onto the floor where his nose falls out of it. Then his pelvis and legs fall out of his chair.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob is excited, but Squidward is nervous.]
Both: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: Here it comes!
Mr. Krabs: In order to pay off these damages, you two are gonna work for me forever!
SpongeBob: Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward! We got our jobs back! Forever!
["Forever" once again echoes inside Squidward's mind, and the camera zooms in on his bloodshot eyes.]
Narrator: One eternity later...
[The Krusty Krab is shown to have full of dust, but without any customers. Cobwebs are everywhere. A skeleton Squidward brushes off the floor, and a skeleton SpongeBob waits in the ordering boat.]


[The episode starts at the Bikini Bottom Zoo.]
Narrator: Ah... the Bikini Bottom Zoo is having its annual Free Day. Free balloons...
[Jimmy gives Monroe a balloon but Mr. Krabs, disguised in a mustache, steals all the balloons from him.]
Narrator: Free drinks...
[Mr. Krabs comes by and fills up a huge barrel.]
Narrator: Free light bulbs?
[Mr. Krabs unscrews a light bulb from a path light and puts it into his pants just as the police arrive and become suspicious of him.]
Mr. Krabs: Aha! Top of the mornin', boys! [Laughs nervously] Whew! Next stop: gift shop.
[Mr. Krabs runs into the gift shop, then SpongeBob and Patrick walk by wearing zoo hats.]
SpongeBob: There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!
SpongeBob: [Like an announcer] He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball!
[SpongeBob crumples up his hat and spits it into the air and into a little fish's ice cream.]
Patrick: Why are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!
[The two run into the stadium]
SpongeBob and Patrick: This is the greatest day of our lives!
[Clamu is snoring and gurgling]
Patrick: This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring.
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. We came to see [Announcer voice] pearls 100 feet in the air! [normal voice] Right? I'll try my oyster call.
[SpongeBob makes a strange noise, but he gives up, because the oyster is asleep.]
Patrick: Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob.
[Patrick walks away.]
SpongeBob: Come on, come on, wake up already! [He pulls out his bag of sea peanuts. He looks left and right and then throws one at the oyster. The oyster stirs.] I think it's working!
[The oyster frantically looks around]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, it's waking up!
Patrick: Oh, boy, did I miss it?
SpongeBob: No, the show's about to begin!
[The oyster suddenly cries at the top of her lungs. SpongeBob and Patrick get blown away to the seats. The oyster hops around while bawling. Two zoo employees come running into the arena.]
Zoo Worker #1: What's wrong with Clamu?
Joe: Easy, girl! It's me, Joe! Remember?
[Clamu snarls as if it sounds like a belch and uses her tongue to throw Joe out of Oyster Stadium. Patrick and a nervous SpongeBob wait at the stands]
Patrick: Now, this is a show!
[Outside...]
Announcer: Attention, zoo patrons! Clamu, the giant oyster is on an emotional rampage! Please scream and run around in circles. [everybody runs for their lives and screams] Thanks for coming.
[In the stadium, Clamu is still smashing things and making snarling belch noises. The zoo worker goes up to SpongeBob and Patrick]
Zoo Worker #1: You boys better get out of this area, pronto! There's nothing more dangerous than an emotionally disturbed oyster. [The worker points menacingly at SpongeBob] You didn't do anything that might have caused this horrible tragedy, did you?
SpongeBob: Uh...
Patrick: No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob hides the peanut bag]
SpongeBob: Right. [SpongeBob lets out a nervous shriek]
[Clamu chomps on a piece of metal. Cut to Patrick and SpongeBob leaving the zoo]
Patrick: Man, if I ever see the guy who upset Clamu, I'd have a few choice words for him, like "you"... and... "are" ... and... "a jerk!" [SpongeBob and Patrick have now gotten to Conch Street, where their houses are] Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?
SpongeBob: I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh!
[Walks up his cobblestone path into his pineapple]
Patrick: Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!
SpongeBob: Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate! Now go home! [SpongeBob stomps into his pineapple, slamming the door behind him.] Stupid Patrick... I didn't do anything wrong! Aw, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory.
[He chuckles and turns on the TV]
Johnny: Our top story tonight: giant oyster has its feelings hurt! The only clue that could be found was this lone peanut! And as you can hear, the oyster continues to emit its horrible cry. A cry so powerful, it can be heard around the world. [TV is shown with real people covering their ears in Egypt, Holland, and India] A cry that not only breaks the sound barrier, it breaks the hearts of our citizens! [SpongeBob stares a the TV with a look of guilt and horror] What kind of cruel, careless, evil person would deliberately upset one of Neptune's most gentle creatures? [Hans uses a tissue to wipe a tear off Johnny's face. SpongeBob turns off the TV]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: [screams] No, Gary! How would I know anything about the oyster?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something? [He peers out the window at Oyster Stadium, where we still hear Clamu's wailing] This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now. Who could never hate me no matter what I do? [Cut to SpongeBob knocking on Squidward's door] Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Do you have to knock so loudly?!
SpongeBob: Sorry, neighbor.
Squidward: Oh... that overgrown clam is giving me a headache! I can't even take my afternoon beauty nap!
SpongeBob: [chuckles nervously] Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I... uh... was kind of wondering, um... Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster.
Squidward: You mean you know the guy who did it?!
SpongeBob: [gulps]
Squidward: Oh, this is great! You and I can go turn him in! And then I'll get so much sleep, I'll be gorgeous!
SpongeBob: Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically.
Squidward: You mean you don't know who did it?
SpongeBob: Well, um... I... uh... no. [Squidward slams the door in SpongeBob's face] Squidward? 
[SpongeBob walks away. On his way home, he encounters Patrick in a Sherlock Holmes outfit]
Patrick: Gotcha! [SpongeBob screams and jumps out of his pants]
Patrick: Where were you on the day of today? Don't play games with me, mister!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: Oh, hi, SpongeBob. I'm just continuing my investigation of the Great Clamu Caper!
SpongeBob: Um... have you found out anything?
Patrick: Yes! No, wait, uh... no. [Holds up sand] But this grain of sand looks pretty suspicious, [holds up a rock] and so does this rock! [Holds up magnifying glass to look at a piece of grass] And I've got a few questions for this little piece of grass! Don't worry, SpongeBob! Patrick's on the case! The truth will be revealed!
[SpongeBob runs away]
SpongeBob: I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do!
[We see Sandy and SpongeBob in the treedome, and Clamu is still shrieking]
Sandy: Oh, I can't stand it anymore! That poor, poor critter! What kind of inconsiderate person would upset such a gentle creature?
SpongeBob: Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy.
Sandy: Why, when I find out who caused that oyster so much pain, no more jiggery pokery!
[Holds up the Bikini Bottom Phone Book and rips it in half in front of SpongeBob]
Sandy: Now, what was it you wanted to talk about, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob tries to speak, but can't]
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob, how come you're all twitchy like that?
SpongeBob: Twitchy? Twitchy? Who's twitchy? I'm not twitchy! Sorry, Sandy, I have to, um... um... go get my hair cut. [He runs home]
Sandy: SpongeBob doesn't have hair... or does he?
[SpongeBob runs down the block panting. He runs to the house and tries to open the door. Patrick approaches him to talk]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is startled and he falls apart. His limbs and facial features all reattach in different places] This is it! All of the clues are coming together. I followed these footprints right to this exact spot, and then, right where you're standing, I found this bag of peanuts! Ha! Oh, I'm so close to solving this crime, I can almost taste it! [Zoom in on Patrick's mouth licking what appears to be SpongeBob's head. It is revealed to be instead licking a yellow ice cream pop that appears to be shaped like SpongeBob's head] Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow Popsicle hits the spot!
SpongeBob: Okay, uh, good luck with all that, Patrick, and, uh, I guess I'll see you later!
[He shuts the door, and inside]
Police Fish #1: Open up! This is the police!
[SpongeBob's eyes pop out of his head]
SpongeBob: Uh, uh, just a second!
[Two policefish bust in and one flashes his I.D]
Policefish #1: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
SpongeBob: Y-y-yes?
Policefish #1: Put those eyeballs back in your head, son. We've got a few questions for you.
[SpongeBob puts them in and twists them like a dial until they are positioned. Policefish #2 taps the baton on his hand while Policefish #1 talks.]
Policefish #1: Were you at the zoo on the day of the oyster incident?
SpongeBob: [stutters] Y-yes! [hides in his pants]
Policefish #1: Did you, or did you not take part in various activities of zoo-time merriment?
SpongeBob: Yes... [he sinks even lower into his pants]
Policefish #1: [holds up a peanut inside a ziploc bag with "Exhibit A" written on it] And are you familiar with... this peanut?
SpongeBob: Yes!
[His eyes peer out over the top of his pants. The bottom of his pants rip, and his body falls through.]
Policefish #1: Just one more question... Is it true that you were at the oyster's lair with a Mr. Patrick Star?
SpongeBob: [Sobbing] Yes! Yes! It's true! It's true! It's all true! The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick!
Policefish #1: That's all we need to know, son. Let's book 'im! [clink. The police put the cuffs on Patrick]
Patrick: Wow, you guys are good! I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time! It's the perfect crime!
Policefish #1: Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge, pinky!
[Police Man and Police Man 2 escort Patrick out]
SpongeBob: Oh, no! Patrick's too sensitive for the big house! [SpongeBob follows the police boat to the zoo] Wait! Stop! I'm the one you want! I am the criminal!
[crowd booing and yelling]
Sandals: [Cockney accent] Hey, everybody, let's throw peanuts at him and see how he likes it!
[The crowd is throwing the peanuts at Patrick..]
Patrick: I get what I deserve! [Crowd yelling. Patrick attempts to catch all the peanuts with his mouth.] Ouch.
SpongeBob: Wait! Hold your peanuts! Patrick Star is innocent! I have come here to reveal the truth! They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness!
Patrick: [humming while SpongeBob talks] Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum...
SpongeBob: I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I...
Sandals: Hey! Just get on with it!
SpongeBob: I am the one who threw the peanut! I know now that what I have done is wrong. And so I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster. I am sorry, Patrick. I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom. [Patrick stops humming]
Sandals:  Hey! Let's throw peanuts at both of them!
[crowd yelling]
Zoo Worker #1: [objecting] Wait! Here's the real criminal! [pulls Mr. Krabs out for the crowd to see]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, top of the mornin'! [his fake mustache falls off]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
[All gasping]
Patrick: I knew it!
Zoo Worker #1: Mr. Krabs has stolen a very important item from the oyster. [rips off Mr. Krabs' clothes by accident] Behold! [the crowd gets disgusted] Wait a minute... [reveals Clamu's pearl] Behold! The oyster's pearl! [The crowd gasps in shock; the zoo worker then gives the pearl to Clamu] Here you go, girl.
[Clamu sniffs her pearl and the crowd cheers. But suddenly, the pearl starts to crack. And to everyone's amazement, it hatches into a baby oyster.]
Baby Oyster: Mama! Mama!
SpongeBob: Mother of pearl! The oyster's a mother! And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg!
Baby Oyster: Mama!
Clamu: Aww!
[The baby oyster and Clamu embrace each other.]
All: Awww... [They glare at Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] But it's... Free Day!
[The crowd boos as they throw peanuts at Mr. Krabs, burying him.]


[Scene opens up in front of Nickelodeon Studios, where a security guard is standing by the gate]
French narrator: Last week, a never-before-seen episode of SpongeBob SquarePants was discovered under a desk at Nickelodeon Studios. [a large old-time crowd of excited people is shown] Now all the world is waiting in fevered anticipation to watch... [the title appears on screen] the SpongeBob SquarePants Lost Episode! [an aerial shot of the town of Encino appears] Now, to present the Lost Episode, from Encino, California, the president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate! [inside his house, Patchy is inside the shower, humming; Potty flies up]
Potty: Patchy! Patchy! The kids're here. [flushes the toilet]
Patchy: Wagh! [opens the curtain in panic] Hot! Hot! Hot! Potty, don't you know this is Patchy's private time? [looks at the camera] Oh, hello! Dahh! [covers himself with the curtain] What are you all doing here?
Potty: They're here to see the lost episode. Brawk!
Patchy: But I haven't got the lost episode because I... well, I lost it! [starts to cry]
Children: [off-screen] No, Patchy! Please! Don't say that, Patchy! Please!
Patchy: But it is! It's lost and I have no idea where it is, so it's best if you forget all about old SpongeBob. [shuts the curtain and cries loudly. cuts to a montage of SpongeBob's greatest moments]
French narrator: Remembering SpongeBob. [SpongeBob walks into the kitchen of the Krusty Krab, from "As Seen on TV"; brings it around town, from "Bubblestand"; puts a mustard checkmark on a Krabby Patty then puts it down on a bun, from "The Chaperone"; struggles with his long legs, also from "The Chaperone"; separates into two pieces then joins back together, also from "Pizza Delivery"; stands motionless in awe, also from "As Seen on TV"; struggles lifting up a bar with two teddy bears attached, from "Help Wanted"; skips outside tossing hearts in the air, from "Valentine's Day"; goes for a blue jellyfish but winds up catching himself in his net, from "Tea at the Treedome"; surfs backwards with his pants ripped then wipes out, from "Ripped Pants"; dodges a karate chop from Sandy, from "Karate Choppers"; smokes a bubble pipe, from "Grandma's Kisses"; sheds a layer of his skin, from "F.U.N."; floats around a boat completely inflated, from "Pizza Delivery"; sends a message in a bubble, from "Naughty Nautical Neighbors"; a muscular version of him chases a jellyfish, from "MuscleBob BuffPants"; lies in bed next to Squidward, from "Home Sweet Pineapple"; scrubs the inside of his head, also from "The Chaperone"; clenches onto Mrs. Puff, from "Boating School"; rocks out, from "Band Geeks"; plucks his eyebrows, yet again from "The Chaperone"; sucks on a table, from "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy"; shrinks on the stove, from "Nature Pants"; does a karate dance, also from "Karate Choppers"; blows the sand of Squidward, from "Reef Blower"; wiggles around, also from "F.U.N."; and lastly, gets shut out by Squidward, from "The Paper"; an audience applauds; cuts back to Patchy, who is sitting on the couch]
Patchy: I don't believe I lost the Lost Episode. [screws in his peg leg] I never lose anything.
Potty: What about your leg?
Patchy: Well, yeah, but...
Potty: And your eye.
Patchy: Well, the eye, I...
Potty: And your hand.
Patchy: And the h... oh, get out of here you blasted bird! [shoos Potty away] Hmm... if only I had a map to tell me where the Lost Episode is. [a screeching car sounds and a brick flies through the window and hits Patchy, who mutters gibberish and then falls over]
Potty: What is it? Brawk!
Patchy: Hey... it's a map! It's a map to the Lost Episode of SpongeBob I lost!
Potty: It's a dream come true!
Patchy: [giggles] We gotta go find it, Potty! [shouts excitedly and runs over to the door; snaps] Oh, first I'll need me treasure hunting leg. [grabs a black boot out of a bin of umbrellas and screws it on his wooden leg while limping out the door; it now functions like a normal leg] Come on, Potty! Ah! Times a-wastin'! [runs down the steps, along with Potty]
Potty: Brawk!
Patchy: [an elderly woman sits on her porch, knitting] Ten paces past Mrs. Johnson's house. [walks past the woman's house]
Mrs. Johnson: Would you boys like some cookies?
Patchy: Put 'em in a doggie bag, Mrs. Johnson. Can't right now, we're on a treasure hunt. [continues walking]
Mrs. Johnson: Okay, don't catch a cold.
Patchy: Walk five fathoms past Don's Import Store and Delicatessen. [looks up at a store by that name; walks next to a tree] Half a league to the forked tree. [looks up at a tree with plastic forks growing on it] Oh! [stands somewhere else, looking at the map] Now all that's left is... Huh?! The seven trials of Monkey Lagoon?! [lowers the map and sees a playground full of children] Merciful Neptune. Only for SpongeBob. Only for SpongeBob! [runs into the playground; rides back and forth on a small green horse and screams] Whoa! [goes up and down on a see-saw] Whoa! Whoa! [slides down a slide with his hands up; screams and hits the ground] Ow! [gets spun around on a merry-go-round and screams; he then slowly climbs on the monkey bars while a little kid punches him in the back] Ahh... Ahh... Ah! [inside a giant eye-shaped climbing frame while a group of kids laugh at him, and finally he screams while he gets pushed on the swing by a little girl, and then screams as the swing he was on returns with only a hook attached to it; the little girl stares at it, confused and then cuts to Patchy digging in the sand] We made it. We survived the trials. Oh, I'm really gonna dig this lost episode. [laughs] Dig it, get it? [laughs some more]
Potty: [covered in sand] You stink.
Patchy: And I just got out of the shower. [laughs again; sticks his shovel in the ground and hits something] Hey, Potty, I think I hit something. [camera zooms out; a large treasure chest sits in the sand] Clever, bury your treasure above the surface.
Potty: Brawk!
Patchy: [opens the chest; a golden glow shines from it] This is it! [a man in a construction hat sits in the chest, holding a VHS tape; Patchy takes it; the man cups his hands] I don't know what it means either... [slams the top of the chest on the man] ...but I got what I came for. Come on, Potty, time's a-wastin'. [runs off, jumping around and shouting excitedly again; runs into his house, still excited, and holds the VHS tape up] Yeah! Popcorn. [slams a bag of popcorn down on the table] Soda. [puts a cup of soda on the table] Pickled garlic. [puts a jar of pickled garlic down on the table, next to the other things; runs and sits down] Hurry Potty, hit the remote!
Potty: [drops an egg that hits the remote] Brawk! [the VCR turns on]
Patchy: [grabs the popcorn] This is gonna be great. [a countdown, starting at ten, appears on the screen] I can't believe it. More SpongeBob. [starts eating the popcorn; the countdown makes it's way down to five] This is so exciting! [laughs, shaking the popcorn, which flies everywhere; the countdown ends] Here it comes!
Potty: Brawk. Pipe down.
["Walk Cycles" begins on the TV screen; SpongeBob is walking down the road while techno music plays in the background; his body squishes up, then returns to normal; then, his body extends and his arms flail around; he returns to normal, then squishes up three times, shrinking smaller and smaller, in synchronization with the music; extends his body again; once again, squishes up smaller and smaller in synchronization with the music; extends his body again; starts running frantically while sweating and looking left to right; extends his body, this time with his tongue sticking out and flailing around; begins frantically running again; his limbs and body separate and his eyes pop out of his head; begins walking normally again; "Walk Cycles" ends; color bars appear on the TV, along with a beeping noise; Patchy stares blankly for a moment]
Patchy: That's it? That's the Lost Episode? That was just a bunch of cheap walk cycles!
Potty: What a rip.
Patchy: Grrrrr... [his face turns red and smoke steams out of his ears] SpongeBob betrayed us! [runs over to a wall of framed SpongeBob pictures; begins tearing them off the wall] I'm sorry I ever started this stupid fan club in the first place! [enters his SpongeBob merchandise filled room and starts throwing things everywhere] I'm gonna get rid of all my SpongeBob stuff! All of it! All of it! [rips his SpongeBob boxers out of his pants] All of it! [runs to the door] I'm gonna run away; that's what I'll do, run away! [runs out the door crying]
Potty: Sheesh, what a hothead.
Announcer: [on TV, another countdown has started at twenty-three seconds with the words "SpongeBob SquarePants Episode 118 The Real Lost Episode"] And now, the real Lost Episode.
Potty: Brawk! Patchy, come back, there's more!
Patchy: [opens the door] Really? [shuts the door, then re-enters again, quickly reversing the VHS tape what he did earlier to get his SpongeBob stuff back; sits back down] Hooray, let's watch!
["The Sponge Who Could Fly" title card appears. Opening credits also appear soon after.]
["The Sponge Who Could Fly" opens up in Jellyfish Fields]
French narrator: Here we see the proud jellyfish hunter. [SpongeBob stands completely still at the top of a hill, holding his net] He stands motionless to lure the jellyfish into a false sense of security. [a jellyfish swims right be him] And when his prey ventures to close, he springs into action.
SpongeBob: [puts on his safety glasses; turns into a spring and bounces after the jellyfish; stops in midair and looks down] Huh? [stretches out and starts falling downward, now in normal form] [screams and hits the ground] Ooh! [separates into seven smaller SpongeBob's, who all run away and then join back together, except for one, which SpongeBob catches and places in an open space on his backside; wipes the sweat off his forehead] Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish. [salutes a jellyfish that buzzes over his head] Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty. [a jellyfish floats up and down above SpongeBob's palm; music begins to play as a microphone lowers in front of him; he clears his throat] ♪If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.♪ [SpongeBob's two eyes combine into one big eye; the camera zooms into it and his pupil becomes him flying through the sky] ♪I would fly so very high and touch the sky.♪ [flies through a cloud] ♪And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly♪ [the blue sky backdrop turns back into Jellyfish Fields, and SpongeBob falls to the ground; he gets up] Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants. [a thought cloud appears above SpongeBob's head; SpongeBob's grandfather is inside of it]
Grandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly, we'd have propellers on our heads or jet engines on our backs. [the cloud disappears]
SpongeBob: [snaps] I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine! [cuts to SpongeBob working on building a plane outside of a barn; Patrick walks up to him]
Patrick: What's that contraption, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That, Patrick, is a flying machine.
Patrick: [laughs]
SpongeBob: What's so funny?
Patrick: Well, it's like my grandpa used to say. [a thought cloud appears over his head; Grandpa SquarePants is inside it again]
Grandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly... [notices Patrick] Hey, I'm not your grandfather! [pokes Patrick in the head with his cane; the thought cloud disappears]
SpongeBob: Well, here I go, Patrick! [runs to the front] I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check! [spins the propeller around] Landing gear... [kicks the tire] check! Complimentary peanuts... [holds up a bag of peanuts] check-a-roo. [hops into the cockpit, now with a hat and glasses on] Ready for takeoff! [pushes a handle forward; the plane starts up, then comes to pieces; the propeller spins through the air and slices through a grain silo next to the farm; sand pours out of it and covers him and Patrick]
Patrick: You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!
SpongeBob: Don't remind me.
Jenkins: [runs up] I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines! Now git! [Patrick and SpongeBob run away]
Patrick: We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food! [cuts to Patrick standing in front of his rock, looking dumb; SpongeBob runs up with blueprints in his hand]
SpongeBob: Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders... [blows raspberries; cuts to him standing on the top of a cliff in a rubbery bat costume] This one's gonna fly! [stretches out the wings; the camera focuses on SpongeBob's butt, which is sticking out more than ever] I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?
Patrick: [at the bottom of the cliff] Ready!
SpongeBob: [jumps and starts flapping his wings; starts gasping] It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm... [ceases to fly] falling! [hits the ground] Ooh! [Patrick runs over and sprays him with a fire extinguisher; cuts to SpongeBob, holding a clipboard, and Patrick, walking]
SpongeBob: This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly! Behold. [walks up to a lawn chair with two balloons attached to it and a brick sitting on it]
Patrick: Oh boy, a birthday party!
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three. [goes over and picks up the brick] All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and... [turns around and realizes that his invention is no longer there] Huh? [looks up and sees it flying away] Well, back to the drawing board.
Patrick: Can we have the cake now? [singing] Happy, happy birthday to you! [cuts to SpongeBob, attached to a red kite, which is attached to a bicycle that Patrick is on]
SpongeBob: Patrick, get ready to say "Eureka!"
Patrick: Okay!
SpongeBob: Go! [Patrick starts pedaling; SpongeBob lifts up off the bucket he is standing on and flies through the air] It's working! I'm flying! [flies past three fish on the side of the road]
Cap Fish: Hey! Look at that guy tied to a kite!
Fred: Why's he doing that?
Nancy: Oh my goodness...
Fred: Why's he doing that?
Cap Fish: He'll fall and break his...
Nancy: Can you see from up there?
SpongeBob: Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you. [suddenly, the kite snaps on him and falls out of the sky] D'oh! [Patrick keeps pedaling as SpongeBob repeatedly hits the ground behind him] Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! [the three fish crack up; cuts to the Barg'n-Mart; SpongeBob is standing at the cash register in front of Vendor; he puts the shredded kite on the counter] Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite.
Lou: Hey... I know you. Yeah, from today's paper! [holds up a newspaper with a picture of SpongeBob on the front page and the headline "Local Nutcase Tries to Fly"]
SpongeBob: "Local nutcase tries to fly"?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs, too!
Lou: No they didn't.
SpongeBob: [raises his fist] You'll see. [walks outside, and past Monroe and his mother]
Monroe: Look mom, it's the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom.
Mable: Wow! I wonder why he's still using his legs.
Monroe: Come on, Bird Man. Flap your wings and fly! [makes flapping motions; he and his mother laugh cruelly; SpongeBob walks away, only to encounter many other fish]
Cap Fish: Hey, Bird Man, going to check on your eggs?
Nancy: Maybe he's looking for a statue to poop on.
Fred: [steps in front of SpongeBob and starts flapping his arms and making chicken noises; a crowd of fish around him laughs]
SpongeBob: Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams! [two fish holding babies stand to the side of him]
Mother #2: You think you're the only one with unfulfilled dreams?
Stubble Fish: I was supposed to be a concert pianist... until I realized I didn't have any fingers. [looks at his hands]
Nat: We all had dreams.
Nancy: What makes you so special? [the crowd of fish turns into an angry mob, along with pitchfork and torches]
Mob: Let's get him!
SpongeBob: [the mob chases him; he starts panting, then stops] Huh? [camera zooms out to reveal SpongeBob just stepped off the edge of a cliff and he screams]
Nat: Good riddance, dreamer!
SpongeBob: [screams as he lands in a Mud Removal truck] Ooh! [the truck makes a sharp turn and SpongeBob falls out, covered in mud; while falling] Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh! [lands in a Feather Delivery truck; sticks his head up, which is now covered with feathers] I guess I spoke too soon.
French narrator: [Note: television version only] [the scene freezes] Will SpongeBob learn to fly? Stay tuned.
[fade to black.]
[Cut to SpongeBob, with a towel wrapped around his body and the top of his head, looking out the window at the jellyfish flying by]
SpongeBob: There they go again, Gary. [sighs] I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life. [takes off his towel, under which is his underwear, and tosses it away] Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true. [grabs his pants and puts them on] Back to reality. [walks over to the sink; Gary follows]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, my dreams are silly. [takes the towel off of his head; grabs a comb and blow-dryer and starts brushing and drying his spongy hair; the phone rings; he sticks the blow-dryer partially in his pants and answers the phone] Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What? [the blow-dryer starts to inflate his pants] No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Mama? Well, listen up, Joe. [Gary retreats inside his shell] I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible. [floats upward and hits the ceiling] I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary! [pulls the blow-dryer out of his pants] I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come! [the top half of his pineapple opens up and he flies out of it]
Monroe: [points] Mom, look! It's the flying guy!
Mable: Wow, I guess he wasn't a lunatic after all.
SpongeBob: [flying over the town] ♪I'm flying. I'm flying!♪
Citizens: [Cap Fish pops up] ♪He's flying!♪ [Nat pops out the window] ♪He's flying!♪ [Miss Shell pops up] ♪He's really, really flying!♪ [Nancy opens her door; Tom pops out of the sewer, moving his fingers in rhythm]
SpongeBob: ♪They laughed, they scoffed, before I had liftoff.♪
Citizens: [Miss Shell stands next to Martha holding balloons; an aqua fish stands next to another older fish; Lenny and Vendor pass by] ♪But now he's flying.♪ [SpongeBob passes over them] ♪He's flying high in the sky.♪ [Nat drives by in a boat; another fish drives behind them; a couple other fish enter the scene]
SpongeBob: ♪I'd love to hang around to say I told you so.♪ [takes off] ♪But it's off to Jellyfish Fields I go!♪ [passes by a sign pointing in the direction of the Fields, making it bobble] ♪Roads and streets are not for me.♪ [passes over an intersection with a stoplight]
Mrs. Puff: ♪Help! Please help! My snail is up a tree. I've had her since I was a little girl.♪ [takes a deep breath] ♪But now it looks like the end of her world.♪ [the tree branch holding the snail snaps off] No!
SpongeBob: [catches the snail] Gotcha! [laughs; hands the snail to Mrs. Puff] Next time, try the elevator. [flies off]
Mrs. Puff: Thank you, Bird Man!
SpongeBob: [flies upward in a circle, leaving a swirling rainbow path behind him; flies up to a plane, in which Billy is sitting, among others] ♪I have never felt so free!♪ [Billy looks out the window at SpongeBob in bewilderment] ♪High in the sky is the place for me.♪ [flies away; Billy pulls down an oxygen mask and starts breathing heavily] ♪Helping friends from up above.♪ [SpongeBob flies onward some more, still leaving a rainbow path behind him; sprinkles drop down over a group of children; Monroe sticks his tongue out and catches one, then makes a face in disgust] ♪These are the things that I love!♪ [picks up a dime off the ceiling of a building and drops it in Mr. Krabs's hand] ♪I'll help Mr. Krabs reclaim his dime.♪
Mr. Krabs: I'm rich!
[cuts to Patrick who stares in awe at a mime doing his shtick; SpongeBob swoops down and lifts him into the air]
SpongeBob: ♪And I'll save Patrick from this mime!♪
Patrick: Thanks, buddy!
SpongeBob: [flies over to a kelp bush] ♪Even Plankton needs some help, when he gets tangled in the ke-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-elllllllp!♪ [inside the bush, Plankton is struggling to untangle himself from a piece of kelp; SpongeBob lifts him up]
Plankton: Please put me down!
[cuts to the Bikini Bottom News, where Johnny is reporting]
Johnny: All of Bikini Bottom is abuzz over the identity of a mysterious flying man who helps people. [cuts to Tom, wearing a bad hairpiece]
Tom: He found my hair piece! [cuts to Tyler]
Tyler: He helps people... and he flies... and he helps people.
Fish Head: [back at the desk] Who knows what superhero act of courage he'll astound us with next?
[cuts to a foggy night at Goo Lagoon; the lighthouse is shining its light around, when suddenly, it goes out; Johnson and an old fish run up]
Nat: Oh no! The light in the Goo Lagoon lighthouse went out, and Sailor Jenkins is headed for the coastline!
Jenkins: [drives through the fog in a boat on the lagoon] I'm glad I gave up farming!
SpongeBob: [flies down] I'm coming! [takes out the old light bulb and reaches behind his back to get a new one; screws it in and flips the switch; it turns on and Sailor Jenkins turns back around; a crowd of people run up, cheering]
Nat: Thanks, mysterious flying man!
Jenkins: [slams into a large rock in the middle of the lagoon; starts to sink] I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines!
SpongeBob: [walking away, with his pants deflated, brushing his hands off] That's enough good deeds for one day. I've got a date with a flock of jellyfish.
Mr. Krabs: [runs up] SpongeBob! Son! I need you and your magical pants!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I invented these pants so I could fly with the jellyfish! If I keep doing favors for people I'll never make my dreams a reality. [starts to walk away]
Mr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, it's an emergency!
SpongeBob: [stops; inflates his pants] Let's roll! [flying through the sky with Mr. Krabs in his arms] Where to, Mr. K?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... my garage.
SpongeBob: You've got it! [lands next to Mr. Krabs' garage] What's the emergency, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure you're up for it, boy?
SpongeBob: I think my pants can handle it.
Mr. Krabs: I need you...
SpongeBob: [anxiously] Yes?
Mr. Krabs: To clean...
SpongeBob: Clean up crime?
Mr. Krabs: My garage.
SpongeBob: [his pants deflate] That's your emergency?
Mr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, everyone knows it's easier to clean a garage when you can fly!
SpongeBob: [crosses his arms] All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors! [inflates his pants again; later, he flies out of the garage, finished with the job] All done, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [sunbathing] And the recyclables?
SpongeBob: Aw, shrimp. [turns around and re-enters the garage; even later, he flies away] Finally! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!
Patrick: [off-screen] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick's in trouble.
Patrick: [lying on his back in the street] SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [flies down to him] What is it, buddy?
Patrick: Will you scratch my tummy? [SpongeBob gets annoyed but does it anyway] Ah...
[a montage begins]
Larry: Help me pick out a tie? [holds out three different colored ties; SpongeBob picks one]
Squidward: Clean my bathtub? [SpongeBob unwillingly obeys]
Mrs. Puff: Balance my checkbook? [SpongeBob scribbles in her checkbook]
Plankton: Help spread the word of evil? [SpongeBob hands out newspapers with the headline "EVIL" on them]
Hat Fish: Untangle my phone chords?
Cap Fish: Do my geometry?
Nancy: Talk to my plants.
Gray Fish: Rub my scalp? [SpongeBob rubs the man's scalp] Mmm... oh yeah!
SpongeBob: [stops and starts flailing his arms] Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm supposed to be at Jellyfish Fields right now. But instead, I'm rubbing your scalp. And I don't even know who you are.
Gray Fish: But, we went to elementary school together.
SpongeBob: Dennis? [starts rubbing his scalp again]
Dennis: Mmm... oh yeah!
[cuts to a crowd of fish searching for SpongeBob]
Cap Fish: SpongeBob!
Monroe: Hey SpongeBob!
Fred: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [hiding behind a rock] If I don't give these feverish favor-seekers the slip, I'll never get to fly with the jellyfish. [quietly flies away]
Monroe: Hey! There he is!
SpongeBob: [flies faster]
Monroe: He's getting away!
Light Purple Fish: No! He owes us favors!
Monroe: Get him! [the angry crowd chases after him, into Downtown Bikini Bottom; while SpongeBob flies past the buildings in a straight line, the crowd runs up and down each building; they stop at a cliff, before Jellyfish Fields; SpongeBob keeps flying]
SpongeBob: I'm almost at Jellyfish Fields. I'm gonna make it!
Nat: He's headed for Jellyfish Fields! We'll never catch him now!
Jenkins: [off-screen] I'll take care of this!
Crowd: It's Cannonball Jenkins!
Jenkins: [inside a lit cannon, wearing a red helmet and suit; launches out of the cannon and toward SpongeBob; he collides with him, and SpongeBob's inflatable pants explode; the two hurtle toward the ground; SpongeBob falls even further as Cannonball Jenkins opens up a red parachute] I told you nothing good would come from city folk and their flying machines! [the crowd watches as SpongeBob crashes to the ground; they walk over]
Fred: What have we done? [starts to cry] Come on, everybody! I think a proper burial is in order. [picks up the pants] A pair of pants like these come around... once in a lifetime. [the crowd leaves; SpongeBob, now in his underwear, regains consciousness]
SpongeBob: Well, it was fun while it lasted. [walks up to Jellyfish Fields, then walks away] I guess I'm not meant to fly after all. [sighs; starts to raise up in the air; a group of jellyfish are below him, carrying him up] Huh? Hey! My jellyfish friends are helping me fly! Without pants! I guess it just goes to show... [the jellyfish carry him back to Bikini Bottom] ♪You don't need a plane to fly♪ [Johnson looks out the window at him] ♪Plastic wings may make you cry♪ [a flock of scallops fly by] ♪Kites are made for windy days. Lawn chair with balloons... fly away♪ [the crowd of fish bury SpongeBob's pants as the mourn over them] ♪Inflatable pants... you may as well skip!♪ [arrives at his home; the jellyfish put him back on the ground] ♪If you want to fly, all you need... is friendship. Yeah.♪ [the jellyfish buzz away; waves] Goodbye, jellies! You taught me a valuable lesson. Although I'm not quite sure what it was.
Patrick: [walks up] Hey! Let's fly down to the pizza house for a slice.
SpongeBob: No more flying for me, Patrick. I'll leave that to the jellyfish. [opens his door]
Patrick: Suit yourself. [lifts up his arm and flies away]
SpongeBob: [turns back around] Did Patrick just...? [laughs] Nah! [enters his house again, but opens the door one last time, just to make sure.]
Patchy: Wow! Wasn't that great, kids?
Potty: Let's watch it again.
Patchy: [chuckles] That's a great idea, Potty. [looks on the table] Where's the remote? [continues searching] Where's the remote? [stands up] Oh, I lost the remote! They should make those things... [a brick flies through the window and hits Patchy on the head] Eh... [falls to the floor]
Potty: Brawk!
Patchy: [stands back up and drops the brick on his foot; he is now holding his remote] My remote! [goes to the window] Thanks, stranger!
Mrs. Johnson: [outside, in a wheelchair] Don't mention it, Patchy! [flames shoot of the back of her wheelchair and she peels off, leaving a skid mark behind]
Patchy: Now, which one of these cockamamie buttons is rewind? [presses a button; a juggling clown appears on TV] No, that's not it. [presses another button; a weatherman appears on TV] D'oh! Wrong again. [keeps flipping through the channels and grunting; a black and white horse movie comes on, then a blob movie, then a football game, then the giraffe from "Krusty Krab Training Video," then the anemone from "Your Shoe's Untied" then a Tyrannosaurus Rex battling a Triceratops; Potty flies over]
Potty: Brawk! Let me do it!
Patchy: No, get away! [the lights go out] That's the light switch! Give me that! [the lights turns back on; Patchy and Potty fight over the remote, until a mariachi band pops up from behind the couch]
Potty: Brawk! That's the mariachi band button.
Patchy: Grrrrr... I hate technology!! [continues pressing buttons on the remote] Rewind, darn you. [suddenly, the VCR starts spitting out the VHS tape]
Potty: Brawk. Failure ahoy.
Patchy: No! [tries to stop the VHS tape from spewing out] Stop! Stop! Go back, infernal machine! [gets tangled up and falls over, still struggling] Oh no! I've ruined the lost episode! Now it's lost forever!
Potty: Brawk! Lost forever!
French narrator: Oh boy, what a loser. Well, I guess the lost episode will remain lost. But, tape or no tape, as long as there are stars in the sky, SpongeBob will live on in our hearts and in our minds. [a SpongeBob constellation appears over Patchy's house] Now get lost. I mean, bye. No, really, get lost.


SpongeBob: ♪Someday, I'm going to make you sweetie. Not overtly, but sur-rep-titious-ly.♪ Drum solo! [uses spatula as drum sticks] ♪Dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga—doo. Doo, doo, doo, Doo. Doo!♪ Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done. [flips all the patties into the air then uses one of his special helmet gadgets to squirt ketchup and mustard on the patties. When the patties fall, they land on a bun that SpongeBob is holding. He then deals out the lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes as if they were cards to the six patties] In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen such a perfect group of patties. Especially— you. [points to a patty with lettuce for hair, tomatoes for eyes, a pickle for a nose, ketchup for rosy cheeks and mustard for a smile] Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you— Patty?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need that order of six.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six. [only gives Squidward five patties] That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything. [laughs]
Squidward: Uh— yeah.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: "That which is fried, must be eaten."
Squidward: SpongeBob, where is that other— oh, there it is. [takes the patty to the table. SpongeBob looks out the kitchen door to see three muscular guys sitting at the table, in which two of them are eating patties while the other one doesn't have one]
Muscular Guy #1: [being impatient for the patty] Where's my Krabby Patty?
Squidward: Right here, muscleboy.
Muscular Guy #1: It's about time. [before he takes a bite, the patty sheds a tear]
SpongeBob: [screams and grabs the patty] No, I won't let you do this to Patty.
Squidward: SpongeBob, hand over the Krabby—
SpongeBob: [sitting under the grill] Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved. [opens up the patty] Amazing.
Squidward: [snickering] What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it? [continues snickering]
SpongeBob: Great idea. [runs off]
Squidward: [sighs] I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist.
SpongeBob: [gives a Krabby Patty to Muscular Guy #1] Enjoy, sir.
Muscular Guy #1: Can I eat this one? [lifts the top bun up off to reveal a familiar black leather shoe in the Patty] What....? Hey, how'd they know? I loved grilled shoe. [cut to SpongeBob's house where Patty is cooking with SpongeBob on the grill]
SpongeBob: What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us. [small explosion] Fire! [alarm bell rings. SpongeBob pants] Fire! Fire!
Gary: [by a fire extinguisher] Meow. [puts out the fire. SpongeBob stops panting]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now. [doorbell rings] Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell. [opens the door]
Patrick: [lifts SpongeBob up] SpongeBob, how about another game of— [ties SpongeBob in a knot] tie your best buddy in knots. [lies down] My turn.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick. [unties himself] I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out.
Sandy: Hi-yah! [karate chops door open] Hey, SpongeBob, you didn't forget about our plan to go a-choppin', did you?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready.
Sandy: Well, that makes as much sense as a snake with no slither. Patties are put in the water for eating, SpongeBob. Not for beboppin' all over Timbuktu.
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that. [walks away] Patty and I have to be on our way.
Patrick: I've been replaced by a sandwich! [sobs] Maybe I could meet a lovely sandwich of my own. Yeah, that'll show SpongeBob. [walks away. cut to SpongeBob dancing with his patty and singing]
SpongeBob: ♪Oh, baby, They may call me a fool, But I can't help our gravitational pull. When I stuff you with cotton candy, it reminds me you're so sweet. When we go riding, it's dandy. The way you hang onto that seat, Ba-ay-ay-by!♪ [they feed the scallops some bread] ♪When I'm with you, Our love is stronger than glue.♪ Whoo! ♪Oh, baby! There isn't anything. There's nothing in the world, I wouldn't do for you—♪ [SpongeBob sees Patty gone and is being surrounded by scallops] Hey, let go of her, you Patty-eaters! No! Get away! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! [he is using karate to break the scallops] Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Yah! Yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hiiiiyah! Patty, you okay, sweetoms? ♪I'm so— sorry! I'll never let you out of my sight again, And I'll always keep you out of harm's waaa-aaaa-aayyyy!♪ [SpongeBob is rowing a boat] ♪Oh, baby. Our love is so strong. That's why I'm singing this song. Ba-ay-ay-by! Your looks are sweeter than honey. From your pickles to your buns, It ain't even funny—!♪ [they fall off of a waterfall and into the river. Races for the patty] I'm coming for you! [he lifts her sunhat in which floats in the water and all her ingredients are spilled everywhere] Oh, no! Look at you! Don't worry, Patty! I'll take care of this! [he puts her back together but the patty is soggy] There you go! ♪All better. Oh, baby.♪ [cut to SpongeBob and Patty on a picnic. Patty has become rotten] Oh, Patty. Do you realize what this signifies? Mm-hmm. That's right. It's our six-hour anniversary. And do you know what that means? Are you all right, Patty? You don't seem so hot. Don't worry, I know what'll make you feel better. A dinner at the finest restaurant in Bikini Bottom. [cut to the Krusty Krab at an early evening with a vibrant pink sunset]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Where the barnacles is our fry cook? He's been gone all day. That boy's never been a work shirker. We got a crowd of hungry customers waiting.
Squidward: How should I know? Do I look like my idiot's keeper?
Mr. Krabs: Well— actually— [doors open to SpongeBob in a tux]
SpongeBob: Good day, sir.
Squidward: As if on cue.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's with the fancy getup?
SpongeBob: Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date.
Mr. Krabs: A dinner date? Well, blow me down, boy. I didn't know you had it in you. so when do we get to meet the little lady? [quietly] By the way, is she rich?
SpongeBob: She's rich in taste.
Squidward: How could you possibly date anyone? I mean, look at you. She must be blind. [limousine arrives]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, a limousine.
SpongeBob: There she is.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can smell the money already.
SpongeBob: [carrying in Patty] Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town. [walks by a couple eating and they sniff the odor in the air]
Martha Smith: Harold, again?
Harold Smith: Martha, I know what you're thinking. It's not me this time.
Martha Smith: Well, whatever it is, it's disgusting.
Harold Smith: Let's get out of here. [they walk away]
Martha Smith: Yuck.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Squidward— allow me to introduce my date— Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Your date's a...Krabby Patty? [to Squidward] Methinks the boy's really lost it.
Squidward: [sniffs the odor and wafts the air] What's that putrid odor?
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] Oh, it's that Krabby Patty. [the patty is messy as a foghorn blows] What are you doing with that rotten piece of meat, boy?
SpongeBob: This isn't a “piece-o-meat”, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty. [quietly] And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the "manager's treatment," do you?
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, boy. no can do.
SpongeBob: Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different. [shows a $5 bill]
Mr. Krabs: What was that? I couldn't hear you.
SpongeBob: [gets out more money] How about now?
Mr. Krabs: All right, take a seat. [takes the money]
SpongeBob: Grrrrrazie! [gets out a tiny throne seat for Patty] Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen. [Squidward shows up. Speaks with a French accent] Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?
Squidward: Well, you should know considering the fact you work here, sod for brains. Speaking of sods— why don't you get rid of this garbage? It's starting to stink up the joint.
SpongeBob: Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie.
Squidward: I'll show you sick. [grabs the patty]
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?
Squidward: Beautiful, huh? How beautiful do you think this is? [patty has maggots in it and is gross]
SpongeBob: [takes patty from Squidward] Stop it, Squidward! Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea.
Squidward: Well, I definitely see I can't help the mentally atrophied. Goodbye, Creature.
SpongeBob: Patty, you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you— [sniffs] Yeah, what is that smell? [gasps] Patty? [the patty looks the same way it was before when SpongeBob showed Mr. Krabs and Squidward. Screams as he drops the Krabby Patty on the table] What happened to you?
Mr. Krabs: I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does. [rotten tomatoes fall out of the patty] Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So— I did. do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?
SpongeBob: Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten. That's what they're put in the ocean for. And it looks like yours is way past due.
SpongeBob: I see now. I see what I must do. [jumps up on the table] Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love. [the sickness rumbles. Eats it]
Mr. Krabs: Well done, boy. As a reward for your valiant effort, I'll only charge you 25¢ for the patty. Employee discount.
SpongeBob: [starts to puke] Can I get a doggie bag with that?


The Greek Chorus: Behold! We are the Greek Chorus! We narrate this epic tale of stupidity!
[Title card music plays, and soon the opening credits appear. The episode starts afterwards.]
The Greek Chorus: [all clear throats together] Behold Neptune, god of the sea, [Neptune arrives] with his mighty trident, a weapon so powerful, [King Neptune picks his teeth, then flicks off the food gunk.] nothing is beyond its user's reach! Behold the Kraken! [The Kraken appears from the ground. It roars and sprays saliva over The Greek Chorus] Gross monster.
[The Kraken continues roaring. King Neptune fights against the monster with his trident. He creates a lightning fist and punches the Kraken to make it go very far away.]
The Greek Chorus: Behold Neptune triumphant! [King Neptune combs his hair with his trident] What an awesome dude! [King Neptune goes on his golden smartphone. SpongeBob walking with his spatula in his pocket and reading a comic book as he walks] Behold this idiot and beware, for trident trouble comes!
[SpongeBob accidentally knocks into King Neptune, who happens to be still on his smartphone, knocking their spatula and trident respectively to the ground.]
SpongeBob: Sorry. [unknowingly picks up King Neptune's trident while King Neptune unknowingly picks up his spatula. Both walk off]
The Greek Chorus: See?
[SpongeBob walks to the Krusty Krab, still reading his comic book as he walks. Inside the Krusty Krab, all the customers are acting wild and savage.]
Customers: [repetitively chanting] Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!
Fred: Food! Food! Ah. [takes SpongeBob's comic book and eats it.]
SpongeBob: Hey, I was still reading that! [force-opens Fred's mouth and reads the last few pages of the comic]
Squidward: Forget the stupid comic! We've got a situation here! We don't have any Krabby Patties, and these animals are trying to eat us instead! [a customer eats Squidward's arm. Squidward is stunned, then looks at his eaten arm.] Hey, who's responsible for this? [his arm is in an old lady's mouth, then she slurps it up, and then picks her teeth with a toothpick.]
Mr. Krabs: [sounding scared] Get to flipping those patties fast, boy-o! Before we all become the lunch special!
SpongeBob: I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!
[Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen through the kitchen window hole, smacking through the "bowling pins" of ketchup and mustard bottles. "Order here" sign changes to "Strike!." Fred chomps off a piece of the sign.]
[SpongeBob takes some patties from his Krusty Krab employee hat, pushes them into him, then blows them out through the top of his head, onto the grill. SpongeBob swings Neptune's trident like a baton.]
SpongeBob: [suddenly notices masses of unchopped tomatoes and lettuces] Oh, the toppings haven't been prepped! I wish this lettuce and tomato would just cut themselves up! [trident magically turns the tomatoes and lettuce alive.]
Tomato #1: [with a knife and a cleaver] Let's do this!
Lettuce: Yeah! Cut me up good, girlfriend! [clicks fingers]
[Tomatoes and lettuce chop each other up]
SpongeBob: [sees that the tomatoes and the lettuces are chopped] Huh. I guess I did chop the toppings up after all.
Squidward: 37 Krabby Patties! Fast! [Customers grab Squidward and Tom eats his hat]
SpongeBob: 37 patties? How am I gonna flip 37 patties? [pauses] Huh, has my spatula always had three heads? [attempts to use trident as a spatula]
The Greek Chorus: [comes out of the cupboard] No! And it is not a spatula.
Mr. Krabs: Get them patties out here fast SpongeBob! [customers grab Mr. Krabs by the eye, leaving his clothes] Arrgh!
SpongeBob: Oh, I wish these Krabby Patties would just serve themselves so I could keep cooking. [trident magically assembles Krabby Patties into friendly living characters]
Krabby Patty #1: Hey! [starts clapping his hands above his head]
Krabby Patty #2: Yay! [also starts clapping his hands above his head]
Krabby Patty #3: Yeah! [once again also starts clapping his hands above his head]
Krabby Patties: [all start clapping his hands above their heads. Happily walking out of the kitchen] Woo! Woo! Woo!
SpongeBob: Whoa, my spatula never did that before.
Krabby Patties: [all start calling out in high-pitched voices] Krabby Patty! Krabby Patty!
[Squidward is hiding in his boat station, looking at the live Krabby Patties. Sandals is about to eat Mr. Krabs but stops when he notices the Krabby Patty walking up his table; he throws Mr. Krabs away.]
Mr. Krabs: [notices the Krabby Patties feeding themselves to the customers] Huh? [his pupils turn to the Krabby Patties then he flies like a rocket, where the smokes are coins.] I don't know how you're doing this, boy-o, but keep it up! Folks will pay every cent they have to watch Krabby Patties dance! Look at how cute they are!
[Shows Krabby Patties jumping into a fish's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: [surprised] We're running out of them dancing patties! Faster, boy-o! [pushes SpongeBob to the kitchen] Faster!
[SpongeBob races to the kitchen in attempt to make more of the dancing patties with his trident.]
SpongeBob: [keeps making prodding motions with the trident] Dance! Come on, dance! I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! [taps against a trident prong] I'm trying! [shakes trident] Come on, you, work!
Neptune's Trident: [grunts and moans]
The Greek Chorus: [opens the kitchen cupboard again. Gasps] The sponge has angered the trident. [covers their faces] Trouble comes. [instantly closes the cupboard doors]
[SpongeBob finally gets the trident to work. However, instead of making dancing Krabby Patties like before, the patties become wild and carnivorous. The monstrous Krabby Patties jump out of the kitchen and attack the customers. The customers run out of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: No! This is gonna cost me money!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I wish you wouldn't worry about money at a time like this!
[The trident zaps Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Right you are, boy-o! [give SpongeBob money and then gives everyone else money with his wheelbarrow] Here, take this! Here you go! I can't stop! [the two fish scream and run off while Mr. Krabs keeps giving away money] There you go! What's happening to me?!
SpongeBob: What is going on around here?
Neptune's Trident: Ahem. [points to switch]
SpongeBob: Hey, what's this? [flips switch and makes the trident bigger] Whoa! My spatula is magic!
The Greek Chorus: Magic, magic, magic.
SpongeBob: This is awesome! I will use this magic spatula to help everyone. [lifts trident but falls over on one side. He stands up and runs off to test the trident]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking down the street with the trident.]
Ivy: [at the Kelp Dogs stand with his wife] I'll have two, please.
[The baby drops his pacifier and cries. SpongeBob takes notice of the baby's dilemma.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I'll help you, baby! Boing!
[He shoots some of the trident's power and walks off. The trident's magic transforms the pacifier into a monster. The monster pacifier grabs and sucks the baby like a pacifier. SpongeBob takes notice of a man trying to grow his grass.]
Harold: What's wrong, grass? Why won't you grow? Talk to me. [hovers the ground]
[SpongeBob shoots some of the trident's power at the ground and grows grass. SpongeBob turns and leaves. However, unbeknownst to him, the grass grows larger and comes to life.]
Grass: We'll do more than just talk to yous! Let's see how you like getting mowed!
[The magic grass chase Harold with the lawn mower. SpongeBob jumps onto a rock.]
SpongeBob: There is no problem I cannot solve, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea! [trident magically turns SpongeBob into a God] Hey, get outta here, you pesky jellyfish! [jellyfish swims away]
The Greek Chorus: Whoa, slow your roll! Only Neptune, true ruler of the sea, can control the trident.
Neptune's Trident: [chuckles evilly]
[Meanwhile, King Neptune is having a chat with his wife, Queen Amphitrite.]
King Neptune: So I say, "Look, Zeus, either you come up with more money or Neptune walks."
[Queen Amphitrite laughs. However, she becomes scared and hides in the sand.]
Baby Kraken: [points to Neptune] There he is, ma! That's the man who hit me! [sobs]
Mother Kraken: Don't cry, baby. Mother will handle this. [snarls]
King Neptune: Let us battle! [takes out SpongeBob's  spatula] Take that! [splatters grease on the mother Kraken's dress]
Mother Kraken: Huh? [looks at the grease] This is dry-clean only, you monster!
King Neptune: [looks at spatula] "Property of SpongeBob?"
[The mother Kraken roars.]
King Neptune: Uh-oh.
[The mother Kraken punches King Neptune far out into the distance. The scene changes to Patrick eating an ice cream cone just as SpongeBob arrives.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. You look so sparkly today.
SpongeBob: Of course I do, for I am SpongeBob, Emperor of the Sea. [light shines down on SpongeBob]
Patrick: Oh. [the light melts his ice cream] No! My ice cream! Ooh, why is the world so full of pain? [sobs and eats the cone]
SpongeBob: Fear not, bestest of friends. You shall have all the ice cream you could ever eat!
The Greek Chorus: No, you'll only make it worse!
[SpongeBob uses the trident's power to bring an ice cream truck to Patrick. However, the trident drops the truck and makes it flat, making dozens of ice cream fall out.]
Patrick: Ahhh! Best day ever! [grabs some ice cream]
Ice Cream Man: No, worse day ever. [slips] Oh, my back.
The Greek Chorus: See?
SpongeBob: I can fix this!
[SpongeBob uses the trident's power to repair the truck and put all of the ice cream back.]
Ice Cream Man: Hooray! [drives away]
Patrick: Boo!
SpongeBob: I think I know a way to make you both happy.
The Greek Chorus: You really don't. How do you not get that by now?
[SpongeBob climbs on top of Patrick's head and uses the trident's power form a geyser that spews ice cream from the ground.]
Patrick: An ice cream geyser!
[Patrick plugs his mouth through the opening of the geyser and eats a vast amount of ice cream. In doing so, he ends up getting stuck at the very top of the geyser and gets brain-freeze.]
Patrick: Brain freeze! I can't eat it all! Ah, I've never been more disappointed in myself.
[The geyser sends a torrent of ice cream and floods most of Bikini Bottom. People are running for their lives to escape the flood.]
Medley Fishbowl: Ooh, I like choc... [gets caught in the torrent]
Fred: [floats on a cherry] Oh, the creamy delicious horror.
Patrick: Save us, SpongeBob! Save us! No wait. [eats some more ice cream] Okay, now save us!
SpongeBob: Stop, ice cream! Stop! Stop!
[SpongeBob uses the trident's power to stop the geyser. Patrick lands safely on the ground. However, the geyser erupts ice cream again.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I just made it worse! Patrick, I've ruined everything.
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, I wouldn't say that.
[SpongeBob and Patrick then see Shubie and her husband chasing the monster pacifier with their baby in its mouth.]
Shubie: Our baby!
Harold: I'll never mow you again!
[SpongeBob and Patrick see Harold being chased by the living grass with his mower and Mr. Krabs appears while running after four fish while throwing money.]
Mr. Krabs: Take me money!
Patrick: [gets hit by a coin thrown at him] Ow! Okay, SpongeBob, you ruined everything.
SpongeBob: No sponge should have this much power.
The Greek Chorus: We told you so.
SpongeBob: [irritated] Not helping!
King Neptune: [injured] Well, maybe I can help. I believe I have something of yours. [holds up spatula]
SpongeBob: My spatula! T-Then what's this?
King Neptune: That is my trident!
SpongeBob: Well, take your trident. I don't want it anymore.
[SpongeBob gives the trident back to King Neptune but it zaps him.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Stop! That wasn't me.
The Greek Chorus: Too long away from its true master, the trident has run wild.
Male Greek Singer: What a jerk.
Neptune's Trident: [snickers sinisterly and shoots bolts]
SpongeBob: Sorry! Pardon me! It's stuck!
[King Neptune fights off the trident's power with SpongeBob's spatula.]
SpongeBob: Ahh! Make it stop!
[King Neptune continues to fight until he manages to snatch the trident from SpongeBob's hands and reclaims it while healing himself.]
King Neptune: You have been one naughty trident!
Neptune's Trident: [whimpers and cries]
King Neptune: Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
[The trident affectionately licks King Neptune and it pants like a dog.]
King Neptune: Now let's see if we can fix all of this.
[King Neptune uses the trident's power to stop the geyser and reverse the damages SpongeBob did with it.]
Mr. Krabs: [holding a bat and threatening two fish holding his money] Give me back me money!
[Shubie carries her baby with its regular pacifer. Harold mows the lawn.]
Grass: Mow us good! [gets mowed]
King Neptune: You know, SpongeBob, your spatula is just as powerful as my trident.
SpongeBob: Really?
King Neptune: Ha! Not even close! [laughs] But it's still pretty great.
SpongeBob: Thanks for bailing me out, Neptune. If there's any way I can ever help you, just let me know.
King Neptune: Well, there is one way.
[The scene changes to King Neptune and SpongeBob confronting the two Kraken.]
King Neptune: There they are!
[The two Krakens growl then they gasp.]
SpongeBob: Let's get 'em!
[SpongeBob and King Neptune chase the two Kraken with the monstrous Krabby Patty.]


[In Bikini Bottom, an eerie fog appears, and mysterious singing occurs overnight. SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hey, where's my alarm clock?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Your shell is gone, too?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I think we've been robbed!
Gary: Meow!
[Cuts to Squidward's house]
Squidward: [screams] She's gone! My clarinet is missing!
SpongeBob: Hmm, strange indeed...
[Cuts to Patrick's rock]
Patrick: [screams] My cuff links! They're missing! Oh, why? Why?! [sobbing]
SpongeBob: I hope this doesn't mean that we're missing the one thing that's nearest and dearest to our heart.
Squidward: Nope, I'm right here.
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab! [cuts to Krusty Krab] Phew.
Squidward: [moans]
SpongeBob: Reporting to duty, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Pearl? what are you doing here?
Pearl: Oh, nothing, SpongeBob. Just trying to juggle schoolwork, having a social life, and running a family business, that's all.
Squidward: Drama queen.
SpongeBob: Where's your dad?
Pearl: I don't know. When I went to get my allowance this morning, he was gone.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is missing?
Squidward: I'm missing my clarinet.
SpongeBob: ...and Gary's shell.
Patrick: Has anyone seen my cuff links?!
Charles: [laughing] So, you lost your cuff links, eh? They're probably in the Bikini Bottom Triangle.
SpongeBob: Bikini Bottom Triangle?
Charles: That's right. First, an eerie fog rolls in, [makes noises with tongue] then, you can hear the hypnotic song of the mermaids. [makes the noise again] And then, poof, your cuff links are gone. Never to return... [he leaves and laughs]
SpongeBob: The triangle must've taken Mr. Krabs! We gotta find him!
Squidward: Maybe Mr. Krabs is doing his morning dumpster dive for loose change.
[Behind the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you out here?
[An eerie fog appears and the mermaids begin singing]
Squidward: Oh, no, is that a mermaid song?
SpongeBob: No, just a thick eerie fog.
[A spotlight appears on SpongeBob and Squidward]
Squidward: Uh-oh!
[SpongeBob and Squidward scream and get pulled into the Bikini Bottom Triangle]
SpongeBob: Squidward.
[Squidward shows up in a gumball machine]
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward, quit messing around. We've gotta find Mr. Kra- [sees gumballs] Hey, gumballs! [He chews one and blows a bubble].
Squidward: Oh! This is the Bikini Bottom Triangle? Looks more like a dump.
SpongeBob: Come on, we've gotta find Mr. Krabs. The Krusty Krab needs him. Mr. Krabs? [Squidward trips and bumps into SpongeBob] Squidward, this is no time for seahorseplay!
Squidward: Oh, my neck.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! [very drawn out] Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Would you shut it already?!
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, Mr. Krabs is gone. Oh, it hurts so bad! I can't take it much longer! I hope he's not in any pain...wherever he is.
Squidward: I think he's doing just fine.
[Shows Mr. Krabs getting a massage]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! You've gotta get up! We gotta get out of here!
Mr. Krabs: Ohh, okay, Tibor, I think I'm good.
Tibor: Remember to drink plenty of fluids.
Mr. Krabs: Look, SpongeBob, you see all this stuff, including you and me, are brought here when the mermaids sing their beautiful song. The mermaids' song triggers this here contrapteron, to suck the sky like a vacuum, dumpin' all the contents here on this island. That is how we ended up surrounded by all this valuable and resellable stuff! [Mermaids begin singing, again] Ooh. Yippee! A new shipment! Free stuff, here I- come? [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs scream as they are chased by a pile of items] Pretty neat, eh, boy? [Mr. Krabs pulls out Patrick]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Have you found my cuff links?
SpongeBob: No. [Patrick begins eating a Krabby Patty] Patrick, is that a Krabby Patty?
Patrick: Yep. Pearl doesn't make them as good as you do, though.
Mr. Krabs: Pearl? [begins crying] Oh, me sweet little girl, all alone, with me cash register!
Pearl: [off-screen]Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Pearl!
Pearl: Get me out of this trash heap! [Removes her leg before falling to the ground]
Mr. Krabs: [hugs Pearl] Oh, me little angel. Thanks, mysterious singing mermaids!
Pearl: Enough with the hugging!
SpongeBob: That's it, Mr. Krabs! I'll just find the mysterious singing mermaids and ask them how to get out of here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are climbing a large hill]
Patrick: Wow, riding by piggy-back is exhausting.
SpongeBob: You're telling me. [falls]
Patrick: [hits the ground]Whoa!
[Shows five mermaids sitting on top of a hill]
Mermaid #1: I love this mirror, girls, but it is sooo ten minutes ago.
Mermaid #2: Like, I couldn't agree with you more.
Mermaid #3: Yeah, like, all this stuff is old news.
Mermaid Leader: Shall we ladies?
All mermaids: [clear throats. begin singing]
Patrick: Ah, excuse me, hi.
Mermaid Leader: Umm, can I help you?
Patrick: [laughs and waves]
SpongeBob: Yes, mermaid ladies, you actually can help us.
Patrick: [laughs] Yeah...
SpongeBob: Yeah, we'd like to know how to get out of here, please.
Mermaid Leader: Like, this is the Bikini Bottom Triangle. Nothing ever leaves. Duh.
SpongeBob: Uhh, are you sure?
Mermaid Leader: Look, little freakazoid, we only know one thing, and that's how to surround ourself with cool new stuff whenever we feel like it, anything beyond that is T.N.O.P.
SpongeBob: T-nop?
Mermaid Leader: Uh, yeah. You know, Totally Not Our Problem.
SpongeBob: Oh, T.N.O.P! Okay, well, thanks anyway. Come on, Patrick, let's go. Patrick?
Patrick: [laughs] You go ahead, SpongeBob. I think I'm gonna hang with the ladies for a bit. [laughs. Cuts to Mr. Krabs using a metal detector]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, come on, I know you're in there! [finds a quarter] Ah-ha! Playing hard to get, weren't you, little one?
Quarter: Little one? How dare you, sir!
SpongeBob: Sir, I'm back. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the information from the- [passes out]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? SpongeBob, boy-o! SpongeBob, can you hear me?
Pearl: Should we help?
Squidward: He looks fine to me.
Mr. Krabs: What's the matter, boy-o? [gasps] Your Krabby Patty meter's on empty! We've got to get a Krabby Patty into you quick or- [the mermaids sing again] Please great vacuum cleaner, please just give us just one- [notices a Krabby Patty at the top of the pile. gasps] ...Krabby Patty. [puts the patty into SpongeBob's mouth]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah!! Wow, sir, that was the single best Krabby Patty I've ever eaten.
Mr. Krabs: Why, thank you, boy-o. I'm glad you- Wait a minute, I didn't make that Krabby Patty, and you didn't make that Krabby Patty, and those two couldn't have made it, so it must have been that rotten pipsqueak Plankton! I've gotta stop that poor excuse for a life form from- So, how do we get out of here?
SpongeBob: Well, sir, based on what the mermaids told me, there er... there is no way out.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, really? Well, I think you don't know who to talk to the ladies.
SpongeBob: Oh, sir, I-
Mr. Krabs: Look, boy, I've got a way with the ladies, and I guarantee the old Krabs charm will have 'em telling us exactly how to get out of this place. [cuts to the Mermaids] So there's really no way out of this place? 'Cause I really need to get back to the Krusty Krab to stop my arch-nemesis from ruining me business.
Mermaid Leader: T.N.O.P, Grandpa.
Mr. Krabs: T-nop?
SpongeBob: [to Mr. Krabs] Totally Not Our Problem.
Mermaid Leader: Oh, and P.S, here's your creepy pink friend back.
[They throw Patrick and he lands on Mr. Krabs]
Pearl: Daddy! Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Pearl, daddy's okay. [Mr. Krabs tosses Patrick off]
Pearl: Can I go to the mall now?
Mr. Krabs: The mall? But, Pearl-
Pearl: [throws a tantrum] I wanna go to the mall! [starts crying while the mermaids are confused by this.]
Mermaid Leader: Like, what's a mall?
Pearl: Wait what? You seriously don't know what a mall is?
Mermaid Leader: I am seriously serious.
Pearl: Well, the mall is, like, only the most awesome place to get all the best, super-coolest, glittershly fabulous new stuff you want!
Mermaid Leader: Really?
Mermaid #3: No way!
Mermaids #1, #2, and #4: We want to go to the mall!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, do you?
All Mermaids: Uh-huh!
Mr. Krabs: Now, how do you propose we do that, huh? Wait, I know we just hit the magic reverse button on the giant vacuum cleaner.
SpongeBob: That's it, sir! It's the mermaids!
Mr. Krabs: It sure is- what?
SpongeBob: The reverse switch is the mermaids! They just need to sing their song backwards.
Mermaid Leader: Yeah! Backwards!
[All Mermaids clear throats and sing backwards]
Mr. Krabs: "Yeah, backwards." What a stupid idea that-
[everbody yells in surprise. The ground starts shaking and the vacuum cleaner sucks in everything on the island and transports them back to Bikini Bottom]
Pearl: You ready for the mall, girls?
All Mermaids: Yeah! Mall! Mall! Mall! Mall!
Squidward: Hello, miserable life, I'm back.
[Some Bikini Bottomites come to the pile]
Old Fish: And so are my dentures!
Gray fish: Tibor! You're alive!
SpongeBob: Isn't that great, Mr. Krabs? Everyone is reclaiming their stuff.
[Mr. Krabs walks away]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Speaking of reclaiming... alright Plankton, I know what you're up to, but the jigs up you little conniving pipsqueak! Huh?
[Charles from the beginning is cooking at the grill.]
Charles: Actually, the name's Charles. Figured I'd hold down the fort for ya while you were gone.
Mr. Krabs: So, you've been the one making me Krabby Patties?
Charles: Yep. All me. Oh, and by the way, you've got a little vermin problem.
Plankton: [in glass jar] Vermin? You take that back!
Charles: He's a feisty one...
Patrick: Hey! I found my cuff links! [puts them in and is shown in a suit] That's better. Good day, gentlemen.
[Patrick gets into a limo and drives away]
Patrick: Home, Reginald.
SpongeBob: Patrick! You dropped your cummerbund!


[The episode begins at Mr. Krabs' house. A boat drives up to the curb where a handsome narwhal named Dylan is dropping Pearl off.]
Pearl: Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan. [blinks her eyelids]
Dylan: No problem, Pearl. You still going for that party tonight? [waves his hair]
Pearl: [gasps] Oh-ho! You bet! [melts herself out of the boat]
Dylan: Nautical. [clicks his tongue] I'll pick ya up at eight. [drives away]
[Pearl is incredibly head of heels with her new boyfriend. She sighs and gently floats to the door, leaving a trail of dust that forms the word, "Swoon". Pearl's floating crashes through the front door and floats over to Mr. Krabs. She stops floating when she wakes up from her daydreaming.]
Mr. Krabs: Again? Come on, Pearly-girl, we're running low on doors here! [picks out a door from the closet and pastes it to the front door]
Pearl: Oh, I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm just so excited about going to the big party tonight!  I—I—I just had to...
Mr. Krabs: [cuts Pearl off] Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Sorry, sweetie. [puts on his hat] Daddy's going out to play cards with the boys tonight. [his teeth is full of cards, his spits them out, and puts them in his sleeve]
Pearl: But, but Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: No buts! I can't be worrying about you all night, honey.
Pearl: [begins to tear up] But, Daddy, I just want to go to the party! [her eyes fill up with tears]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, shrimp.
[Mr. Krabs takes cover and Pearl cries a huge fountain of tears.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa!
[Pearl's tears destroyed everything it touched. The tears destroy a plant and a picture on the shelf. The tears destroy the picture of Grandpa Redbeard, a grandfather clock and Mr. Krabs' first dollar. The grandfather clock coo-coos three times. Mr. Krabs hiding under a footrest. But Pearl's tears destroy it. Mr. Krabs cowers himself from the tears.]
Mr. Krabs: Whew. [his pants rip off] Hmm? [sees his butt showing] Ahh! [covers his ripped pants with tape] There, there, me little beluga. It'll be okay. I hired Mr. Squidward to babysit just like when you were little.
[Pictures of Squidward babysitting Pearl are shown. The first one shows Squidward pushing baby Pearl in her cradle. The second one shows baby Pearl crying while flooding the house and Squidward swimming for his life. And the third one shows Squidward holding baby Pearl in his lap.]
Pearl: Ew, Dad! Squidward is so lame.
Mr. Krabs: Lame, schmame. You and Squidward will have so much fun, you won't want to go anywhere. But just in case. [pushes the button and barricades the doors and windows with prison bars] You won't be able to go anywhere! [cackles until he hears a knock at the door] Oh, just in time.
[Squidward is knocking on the door with a confident smile. He looks at the door and wonders why it's barricaded. Just then, Mr. Krabs answers the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Thanks for keeping an eye on me little Pearl tonight.
Squidward: No problem.
Mr. Krabs: Remember our deal, Squidward. Keep Pearl out of trouble and I'll give you one shift a week without SpongeBob. But if anything happens to my little angel, I won’t give any shifts without SpongeBob...
[Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob out from his pocket. SpongeBob laughs and makes crazy, but creepy faces at Squidward.]
Squidward: No! Please! Anything but that! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs puts SpongeBob back in his pocket] You can count on me.
Mr. Krabs: I knew I could. [gets into his boat and drives away]
Squidward: Whew!
Pearl: Oh, thanks for watching the house tonight, Squidward. I'll be back late. So, you know, don't wait up for [gets snagged by a fishing hook] me!
Squidward: [grunts as he struggles to reel Pearl back] Your dad said we have to stay in tonight! [grunts] But that doesn't mean we can't have [grunts] fun!
[Pearl flops around like a fish and Squidward drags her back in the house. The scene changes to Squidward and Pearl sitting at a table together.]
Squidward: [digs through his backpack] Look. [takes out a whale-shaped doll] We can play with this setaceous Sally doll. [takes out crayons and a coloring book] Or we could color this princess coloring book. [holds up a tape cassette] Or we could sing along with—Ahh!
[Squidward notices that Pearl is gone and sees the ripped up doll on the floor.]
Squidward: Uh, Sally!
[Squidward goes to look for Pearl and sees the coloring book and crayons on the floor.]
Squidward: [picks up the book, looks in it, and screams] Outside the lines! [drops the book]
[Squidward rushes upstairs and goes to Pearl's bedroom door.]
Squidward: [knocks on the door] Pearl? [peaks in] Hello? [goes in her room and sees Pearl ripped wall paper and posters as if she is secretly making piñatas] Hmm, hey, uh, Pearl. Um, whatcha' up to?
Pearl: Arts and crafts!
Squidward: Hey, I dabble in the arts myself. Maybe I can help.
[Pearl turns one of her crafts around and reveals the words "R.I.P Squidward" with skull and cross bones.]
Squidward: [freaks out] Uh, never mind. Uh, you seem to have that under control. I'll just, um, be out here if you need me. Or not. Definitely not. [leaves Pearl's room and sits on a chair] That is one morbid teen.
Pearl: That outta keep him out of my hair.
[Pearl hears a horn honking outside the house. She opens the curtains and sees Dylan parked outside waiting for her. Dylan picks his teeth with a toothpick and looks at his watch. Dylan honks the horn again.]
Pearl: It's go-time!
[Pearl takes out her little mirror and takes a look from outside her room. She sees Squidward sound asleep near the door. She goes to put her craft-shaped head on the bed to fool Squidward. She lifts her Boys Who Cry poster, drills a hole through the wall with her tears and sneaks into the wall. She climbs down through the wall and comes out from below the house. She accidentally slams the house really hard and wakes up Squidward.]
Squidward: [screams] Oh. [gets up] What's happening? [opens her bedroom door] Pearl? Oh. You asleep? Aw, she must've tuckered herself out.
[Squidward taps on the Pearl's head-shaped craft and it slides off the bed.]
Squidward: [screams] Oh, no! Maybe if we get it on ice, then can reattach it—[backs into the wall where Pearl made the home to escape] Ahh!
[Squidward falls through the wall of the house and landed near the bottom of the front door. He digs himself underneath and comes out of the ground with the craft on his head. He pokes his eyes and mouth through the craft when he sees Pearl about to drive away with Dylan.]
Squidward: Huh?
Pearl: Oh, thanks for the ride, Dylan.
Dylan: No prob.
[Dylan drives away with Pearl. Squidward breaks free from the ground and clutches his head.]
Squidward: She's gone! Krabs is gonna kill me!
[Squidward rushes to his recumbent bicycle. He pumps air in the back tire, puts on elbow pads and a helmet. He checks the tire and adds more air in it. He puts the air pump in the basket and hastily hops on the bike. He looks both ways and goes after Pearl. Meanwhile, Dylan is driving past a sign that says, "surface."]
Pearl: Um, that sign said "surface." Are you sure this is the way? [giggles]
Dylan: For sure, babe. We're going to a breach party.
Pearl: Oh, I've never been to one of those before. Sounds exciting.
[Dylan hits the accelerator and quickly drives the boat up a high cliff.]
Dylan: Whoo!
[Meanwhile, Squidward is riding his bike trying to look for Pearl.]
Squidward: Hmm. Mm-hmm. [stops and picks up some dirt] Hmm. Still warm. [sees the sign that says "surface"] The surface, eh? That SpongeBob-free shift will be mine! [He starts to go up the high cliff, but only gets a few hundred yards before his legs start to buckle. He slips back down but he doesn't dare let his bike reach the bottom. Groaning, he keeps biking up that vertical stretch of road] SpongeBob-shift—[grunts] mine!
[At the breach party near the surface, the party goers are having a great time. Some are watching television, eating pizza and drinking soda. Pearl, Dylan and other teenagers are roasting marshmallows over a hydrothermal vent. Pearl munches on the marshmallow on Dylan's narwhal tooth.]
Pearl: Mmm! Oh-ho, Dylan.
[Several teens are having a breaching contest by chugging down soda and jumping to the surface. One teen chugs down some of the soda.]
Teens: [chanting] Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
[The teen stops chugging and a bigger teen shakes him up to have him breach the surface.]
Teens: [chanting] Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach! Breach!
[The small teen floats to the surface and burps. Then he falls back down in the water.]
Teens: Whoo-hoo!
[Pearl, Dylan and the other teens dance to the music on the radio. Moments later, Squidward makes it up the cliff and his completely exhausted.]
Squidward: Pearl!
Teens: [stop dancing and gasp] Huh? What? [A goth girl raises an eyebrow and gives a withering look that would make Squidward look like an amateur]
Squidward: You have to come home right away! We can do whatever you want if we go back now! I'll even play us some jazz! [pulls out his clarinet] Kids love jazz!
[Squidward attempts to play music on his clarinet, but his lousy music makes Pearl, Dylan, and the party goers cringe.]
Squidward: ♪Come on, Pearl. Let's go home. I can't be here all alone.  Let's get back, before we're dead. [one teen covers his face with his hood and another hides in the beach umbrella] Skiddle-bobba-doo-diddle-bop-bop, yeah!♪
[Squidward's "jazzy" music creates agony to the teens.]
Teen #1: No! Jazz making me nerdier! [his face grows pimples, his arms grow smaller and his shirt changes from "cool" to "school"]
[One teen grows braces and his clothing turns into band clothes. Another teen's sunglasses becomes reading glasses. Pearl and Dylan cover their ears from Squidward's music.]
Pearl: Oh, this is so embarrassing!
Dylan: Forget him, Pearl. Let's breach.
[Dylan leads Pearl away from Squidward and goes to the breaching competition of the party. One teen breaches upward over the surface and comes back down into the water.]
Teens: Yeah! [gives high-fives to each other] Yeah! Yes! Yeah!
Pearl: Uh, I don't know. Is it dangerous?
Dylan: Uh-uh, babe. It's nautical. [waves his hair]
[Pearl gasps and giggles.]
Squidward: Pearl! What about yo-yos? Kids love yo-yos! [gets tangled up in the yo-yos]
Pearl: Okay, let's do it! One, two, three, [breaches up really high over the surface] yahoo! This is so coral! [falls and ends up beached on Bikini Atoll's shore; she gasps and flops around] Dylan, help! This isn't nautical!
[The teens see Pearl's feet dangling at the surface.]
Teen #2: Oh, man! She's beached!
Dylan: We're gonna be in so much trouble!
Teen #3: Leave her! Let's cheese it!
Teen #4: Let's get out of here!
[Dylan and the teens ditch Pearl and leave.]
Pearl: [continues to flop around] Oh, no!
Squidward: Pearl, are you alright?
Pearl: Oh, Squidward, I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you.
Squidward: It's okay! Let's just get you outta' here.
[Squidward grabs Pearl's feet and struggles to pull her back down. But he ends up pulling her shoes off and he goes flying backwards. He tries pulling her again, but ends up tearing his own arms off.]
Squidward: Okay, okay, just hold on a second! [runs off]
Pearl: Hold on? What are you—Ahh!
[Squidward plugs her blowhole with the air pump. He pumps air through Pearl's blowhole, making her inflate like a balloon. Pearl floats up high in the air. Squidward pulls the air pump out of Pearl's blowhole.]
Pearl: Huh?
[Pearl flies around all over the sky until she runs out of air. She falls back down into the water and lands gently into Squidward's bike. The party is completely trashed and all of the party goers including Dylan are gone.]
Pearl: [tears up and cries] I can't believe Dylan ditched me! My life is over!
Squidward: Oh, I don't think it's that bad.
[Pearl violently cries a fountain of tears. The tears rip of some of the leave of Bikini Atolls palm trees, scaring several seagulls in the process. Squidward cowers himself in fear.]
Squidward: I'll, um, just get you home.
[Squidward struggles to paddle his bike to bring Pearl home.]
French Narrator: Many, many minutes later...
[Squidward manages to bring Pearl home after a really long and exhausting ride. The bike's tires break into pieces and Pearl gets off to go in the house.]
Pearl: [sighs] Guess I'll just wait for my dad to get home.
Squidward: You know, there is a way we can still have a little fun tonight.
Pearl: Really?
[The scene changes to Pearl and Squidward running up to Dylan's house with a bag. Pearl rings the doorbell and she and Squidward hide behind Dylan's boat.]
Dylan: [answers the door] Like, hello?
[Dylan sees the bag and picks it up. He goes to look in the bag. When suddenly, the bag explodes, revealing SpongeBob inside. SpongeBob laughs and makes the same crazy and creepy faces from before. Dylan screams in horror and runs away. SpongeBob then chases after Dylan. Squidward and Pearl both laugh now that their revenge against Dylan is final, thus ending the episode.]


[A bus is driving down the road with three band members sitting inside.]
Band Member #1: Man, this is gonna be our most rocking tour, ever.
Band Member #2: [singing] Yeah.
Ned: Hey, dudes, check out the debut of my new look. [band members laugh]
Band Member #1: Whoa, what's that on your head?
Band Member #3: Yeah, is that a wig or a pile of toilet paper?
Ned: C'mon, guys, give it a chance.
Band Member #2: Let me try it on. [grabs the wig]
Ned: Hey, you've revealed my shiny dome!
Band Member #2: Hot potato. Catch! [band members throw it back and forth between each other]
Ned: Give it back, man!
Band Member #2: If you want it, you gotta catch it, dude. [throws it to band member, but it goes through the window]
Band Member #1: Oops.
Ned: Ah! Oh, man, my beautiful wig! [the wig flies through the air, in and out of the dump then through the wig cemetery]
SpongeBob: [opens his front door] I'm ready! I'm rea... [the wig crashes into him and he falls over. He sits up and it's on top of his head] Ah, what is this? Curly tresses, poofy texture, [scratches inside wig] itchy scalp... [gasps] it's a wig! [walks over to Patrick's rock] Hi, Patrick. How do you like my new wig?
Patrick: [screams, then jumps on SpongeBob, pinning him to the ground] I'll save you. [jumps on SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Pa... trick... what are... you doing?
Patrick: I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your... [slams SpongeBob's head on to a rock] ...head!
SpongeBob: Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!
Patrick: [stops] Oh, sorry.
SpongeBob: It's okay. [Patrick takes a bite out of the wig] Why did you do that?
Patrick: [swallows and burps] Well, I thought it was a new type of cotton candy you wear on your head.
SpongeBob: Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea.
Patrick: Then what is it?
SpongeBob: It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig.
Patrick: A wig? [laughs uncontrollably] Oh, boy. Don't you think that's a little silly? [in his pocket, an alarm starts to ring so he takes it out] Oh, man, it's time for my weekly condiment soak. [climbs into a tub and pours a giant jar of mustard on himself. Looks at SpongeBob] Do you mind? [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street with his wig on]
Fish #1: Nice wig. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Thanks. I am very fashionable today.
Tina: Hey, SquareFashion, nice couture.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you.
Pilar: So then... [notices SpongeBob] Huh...?
Peterson: Nice do, SpongeBob. [tries to contain his laughter]
Pilar: Yeah, where can I get one? [Peterson and Pilar laugh]
Sally: Whoa. That wig really suits you. [laughing]
SpongeBob: [walks up to Squidward, who is sleeping on the job] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [screams] Who? What? Where? What? How?
SpongeBob: Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?
Squidward: Nope.
SpongeBob: I'm wearing a wig.
Squidward: Oh yeah, how could I have missed it?
SpongeBob: Can you believe I found it lying around in the street?
Squidward: Umm...maybe.
SpongeBob: If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you.
Squidward: I can't wait.
SpongeBob: Wig away! [floats into the kitchen. While grilling some patties, he scratches his wig with the spatula and many hairs float down onto the patties. He puts one of the hairy patties on the bun] Order up, Squidward. [Squidward notices the hair on the Krabby Patty]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs walks up to Squidward] I've served a lot of junk here, but a hair patty?
Mr. Krabs: [walks into the kitchen] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs? [a lot of hairs come off the wig and onto Mr. Krabs eyes]
Mr. Krabs: What in Davy Jones' locker is on your head, son?
SpongeBob: Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, take it off. The hair's getting into the patties.
SpongeBob: Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy.
Mr. Krabs: Happy?
SpongeBob: Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face.
Mr. Krabs: I can imagine.
SpongeBob: Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet. [takes one out] And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster.
SpongeBob: [puts the hairnet over his wig then walks out with an order]
Sandy: There you are, SpongeBob. Are you ready for karate prac...tice? [notices SpongeBob's wig]
SpongeBob: I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?
Sandy: Wig's... uh great...SpongeBob. [laughs uncontrollably]
SpongeBob: Glad you like it. [chuckles] I'll see you later, Sandy. [walks up to a table and sets the tray on it] Two krabby patties and a side order of looking good.
Frank: Nice wig.
Abigail: Like to keep in style, huh?
SpongeBob: You know it.
Francis: Off to meet the queen, Sir Nerdlaroy?
SpongeBob: Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance. [gets off balance with the wig and stumbles into the corner. Everyone crowds around him and laughs] Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs.
Jimmy: How 'bout a little off the top?
Tom: Yeah, your wig is big enough to go around.
SpongeBob: This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous. [walks backwards towards the kitchen] Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me.
Squidward: Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame. [scene cuts to Bigshot Records]
Record Producer: Well, well, well, Ned and the Needlefish. You're fired.
Band: Fired?!
Band Member #2: But why?
Record Producer: Ask Baldy McBalderson over here.
Band: Ned!
Band Member #2: Good going, dude.
Ned: I can't help not having hair!
Band Member #3: When we formed this band, it was for one reason and one reason only: to make a lot of money. And you not having hair is getting in the way of that!
Record Producer: We are selling records, not denture cream! [talking to Ned] Either you come back with hair, or don't come back at all! [scene cuts to Krusty Krab at closing time]
Mr. Krabs: [flips OPEN sign to CLOSED] Time to go home, boys.
SpongeBob: [mopping with his wig] Almost finished. [puts the wet wig on his head. Shakes it dry and it goes back to its original shape] See, Squidward, it's functional, too.
Squidward: It's about as functional as your brain.
SpongeBob: [giggles] Thank you, Squidward.
Squidward: That wasn't a compliment! The entire town is laughing at you!
SpongeBob: I don't understand.
Squidward: [holds a mirror up to SpongeBob] Just look at yourself.
SpongeBob: Hello, handsome. [licks finger and puts it on the mirror] Sss.
Squidward: SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before!
SpongeBob: Hmmm, I've never been tall before.
Squidward: That wig is infested with parasites! [spiders crawl out of the wig and SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: That tickles!
Squidward: Can't you see how ridiculous you look?
SpongeBob: I think that it looks cool.
Mr. Krabs: Hahahaha! You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer! [laughs]
SpongeBob: For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is.
Mr. Krabs: Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: No buts!
SpongeBob: So I can't have a wig or a butt?
Mr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig, get your butt outta here! [scene cuts to Sandy walking up to SpongeBob's house]
Sandy: I never got a chance to talk to SpongeBob yesterday. I was laughing too hard. [knocks on door] SpongeBob? Huh?
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy. What do you think?
Sandy: We need to talk. [scene cuts to The Reef]
SpongeBob: Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody. [everyone is laughing]
Sandy: Well, it does attract a lot of attention.
SpongeBob: I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me.
Sandy: Neither can I, SpongeBob. [they walk in to the theater. Scooter closes the door and laughs. Scene cuts to inside theater, where the movie is playing]
Martha: It's true, John, this isn't my real hair! I stole it! [takes her wig off. SpongeBob walks into the row with his wig blocking the screen]
SpongeBob: Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. [Peterson sticks out his leg [along with an angry Nazz] and SpongeBob trips over it. SpongeBob gets his wig stuck in some cheese on the floor. Get sunstuck but a soda is still in the wig] Hey, the wig broke my fall! [some popcorn falls from the top of his wig] Mmm, popcorn. [eats some then takes the soda in his wig and takes a sip of it] Ah, you always come through for me.
Dale: [With a voice similar to Mr. Krabs's] Hey buddy, do you mind?
SpongeBob: Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie! [Dale behind SpongeBob starts to growl, the camera pans to the right to get a picture of Sandy.]
Sandy: Well, they can't. Look, your stupid wig is blocking the whole screen.
All: [everyone are talking at once. We can hear some of them] Fish #1: Take it off, Jerk!; Fish #2: Hey!; Fish #3: Hey! Down in front!; Fish #4: Take the wig off!
SpongeBob: People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot.
Scooter: That's a great idea! Let's start a riot. [everyone gets a pitchfork or torch ready]
SpongeBob: [screams as he and Sandy run out as the riot follows.]
Frank: [talking to Peterson] I told you that movie was terrible.
[Cut to a grassland, SpongeBob and Sandy are seen walking and talking]
Sandy: Now do you see what I'm saying, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too.
Sandy: It's time to be strong.
SpongeBob: I know. [walks over to the edge of the cliff and takes his wig off] I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!
Sandy: Hurry up, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me. [wig flies off, SpongeBob starts crying] I'll never accessorize again.
Sandy: You did the right thing, SpongeBob. [scene cuts to Ned walking down the street]
Ned: Where am I gonna get some hair? My career is ruined. Ruined! [sobbing] Can it be? It is! My wig. Yes! Victory is mine.
SpongeBob: Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere.
Debbie: Oh, he's got your hair.
Shubie: Thank you.
Patrick: [without a wig on his head] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig.
Patrick: Look at my new wig. [raises his arm and the wig is attached to his armpit]
SpongeBob: Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool.
Fish #1: Yeah, they were. But look... [points to a billboard with Ned and the Needlefish wearing the same wigs]
SpongeBob: Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?
Fish #1: Yes, you were. But not anymore. See ya! [walks off]
SpongeBob: I wish I had a wig. [Patrick walks up to him]
Patrick: Don't be sad, SpongeBob. You can borrow one of mine. [rips his wig off his armpit and pits it on SpongeBob's head] Just wash it before you return it.


[The Krusty Krab is shown and pans to the inside. Squidward is reading a magazine and hears a whale song. He looks in the kitchen and found out it was Patrick]
Patrick: [calls the whale song again]
SpongeBob: [chatters in dolphin. Patrick and SpongeBob then make the noises several more times]
Squidward: Can you two be quiet?!
[SpongeBob and Patrick struggle not to make the noises again, but end up doing so again, knocking Squidward off his feet]
Squidward: Didn't think so. What are you barnacle heads doing, anyway?
SpongeBob: Patrick and I are practicing our favorite noises. Mine is a dolphin, laughing. [chatters again]
Patrick: And my favorite is the plaintiff song of the blue whale. Ahem. [He makes a whale sound which caused an earthquake. Two businessmen are walking down a street and one is a blue whale, who hears the song]
Whale Businessman: Huh? Did you hear that?
Fish Businessman: What's wrong, Frank?
Frank: [The Whale Businessman] That song. It sounds just like Martha!
Fish Businessman: Frank, how many times do I have to tell you? Martha's no good for you! She's just no good!
[cuts back to Krusty Krab and Patrick finally stops. The shaking stops as well]
Squidward: Why would you want to practice such horrible sounds?
SpongeBob: It's one of the activities in our favorite magazine. [Holds up a magazine] Simple-Ton: A ton of simple things to do!
Squidward: It must very challenging for you!
SpongeBob: Oh, it is.
Patrick: Yeah, and it made me look more smart-like. [Goes cross-eyed] What does the magazine say we should do next?
SpongeBob: Well, let's take a look. [Opens book] I think we've done everything in this issue. Oh, except for this one! The Best Friend Quiz! Do you really know your best friend? Oh, this should be easy. Patrick and I know everything about each other!
Squidward: Well, you two have fun with your mutual ignominious society. [Walks away from window]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Bye, Squidward!
Squidward: [Comes back to window] Morons. [Goes away again]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Bye, again!
SpongeBob: You go first, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, no. After you, old buddy.
SpongeBob: Au contraire. After you, mon amie.
Patrick: Please. After you, pal.
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. After you, bestest friend- [a boot is thrown at his head] -Oof!
Squidward: [off-screen] Just pick one! And there's another three where that came from!
SpongeBob: I'll go first. [puts on glasses] Question 1: What is your best friend's favorite color? Hmmm.... I'm thinking........Aquamarine!
Patrick: I hate to burst your bubble, but my favorite color is........ it is aquamarine. Sorry I doubted you.
SpongeBob: No problem. Is your best friend right, or left-handed? The answer is right-handed.
Patrick: [draws "Patrick is awesome" on the Wall] How did you know?
SpongeBob: Simple, Patrick! It's because you're my best friend!
Patrick: Aww!
SpongeBob: Is your best friend's belly button have an innie or an outie?
Patrick: [gasps and grabs boat with Squidward in it] No peeking!
SpongeBob: [Laughs] No need to peek, Patrick. I can do this with my eyes closed! [closes eyes and thinks] You haaaaaaaaaave...
Patrick: Oh! What will his answer be?
Squidward: [sarcastically] The suspense is killing me!
SpongeBob: ...an innie!
Patrick: Well, let's just check that theory! [Looks down at his belly button and sees he's an innie] Innie! [Echoes] Wow! How does he do it?
Squidward: [monotonously] Magic. [takes boat and walks away]
Patrick: My turn! But, give me some hard questions. Not like those softballs you answered.
SpongeBob: Okay! First question: What is your best friend's favorite color?
Patrick: Aw, man! Pulling out the big guns. Color. Color.
SpongeBob: [gasps to give Patrick a hint]
Patrick: No, no! No hints! [Struggles] Blue! No, clear! No! [slaps himself in the face] That's not it. Hold on, hold on. 14.
SpongeBob: The answer is...beige.
Patrick: Oh, barnacles! Oh, I was so close.
SpongeBob: Question 2: Is your best friend left-handed or right-handed?
Patrick: [paces back and forth] Oh, tricky, tricky. Hmm, right, or, left? Right-handed!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I'm ambidextrous! [grows another pair of arms]
Patrick: Oh, fish paste!
SpongeBob: Next question: Does your best friend have an innie, or an outie belly button?
Patrick: Belly button, huh? Hmm. An innie!
[there is a loud buzzer that comes when there is a wrong answer to a question]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick. I have an outie. [Shows SpongeBob's outie belly button]
Patrick: Tartar sauce!
SpongeBob: Well, I'm sure you'll get the next one right! What is your best friend's favorite food?
Patrick: Uh...
SpongeBob: [holds up a sign that says "Krabby Patty" in one hand, and an actual Krabby Patty in the other]
Patrick: Oh! Oh! I remember! Your favorite food is a chum burger!
SpongeBob: [Frowns and puts down sign and Krabby Patty] No.
Patrick: I thought for sure I had that one.
SpongeBob: Okay, let's try an easy one. Is your best friend a boy or a girl?
Patrick: Ooh. That's a toughie. [Eyes SpongeBob's muscles] Hmm. Rugged biceps. [inspects SpongeBob's eyes] Yet, delicate eyelashes. Pass!
SpongeBob: [his work hat deflates. He clears his throat] Uh, last question!
Patrick: [claps hands] Ooh! This is for the win!
SpongeBob: What shape is your best friend?
Patrick: Oh! I got this one! Um, uh, can you repeat the question?
SpongeBob: What shape is your best friend, SpongeBob SQUAREPANTS?
Patrick: Round, flat, uh, hexagon.
SpongeBob: SQUARE-pants.
Patrick: Ooh! It's right on the tip of my tongue!
SpongeBob: [Holds up a timer] Five seconds.
Patrick: [shouts] Um, um, oh, jeez, trapezoid, pentagon, mormorphis...
SpongeBob: Time's up! [timer rings]
Patrick: Triangle!
SpongeBob: Uh, no.
[Cuts to Squidward adjusting his boat outside the kitchen, in the dining area]
Squidward: Idiots, wrecking my boat.
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the dining area]
Squidward: So, who won your stupid quiz?
Patrick: It was a tie.
SpongeBob:  Well it wasn’t a tie, but we had lots of fun.
Squidward: [takes the Simple-Ton magazine] Let me see that. [Starts laughing] a triangle?! Patrick didn't know anything about you! [continues laughing] And he's supposed to be your best friend?
Patrick: I know, it's like we're not friends at all!
SpongeBob: Now, now. Patrick may not have passed the quiz, but like a true best friend, he's always here for me. Right, Patrick? [turns to Patrick, but he's nowhere in sight] Patrick?
[Scene shows Patrick outside, buying ice cream from the ice cream truck]
Patrick: Ice cream!
Squidward: Looks like your best friend isn't a friend at all! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [walks outside to Patrick]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! I got you an ice cream. [holds out an ice cream cone to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [takes the cone] Thank you, best friend, Patrick.
Patrick: It's your favorite! Dill Pickle Swirl with mustard and extra bacon bits!
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is your favorite ice cream. My favorite is, plain vanilla.
Patrick: Oh, oh right. [takes the ice cream out of SpongeBob's hand] Well, more ice cream for me!
[SpongeBob's eyes start watering]
Patrick: Oh, can I borrow five bucks?
[SpongeBob miserably takes the money out of his pocket]
SpongeBob: Here! Take your dirty, rotten money! [throws the money onto the ground] Ahhah! I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE! [runs off, crying]
Ice Cream Man: Hey, what's with him?
Patrick: I guess he didn't want any ice cream.
[Cut to SpongeBob in his room, on his bed, sobbing. Gary comes by toward his food bowl, but he sees it's holding SpongeBob's tears as they land right in the bowl]
Gary: Meow-row. [gets splashed by SpongeBob's tears as he sobs even harder. Gary slithers away crossly] Meow-row-row...
SpongeBob: It just isn't fair! [tries to calm himself down] Oh, who needs Patrick anyway? [leaves his house] Rest of my life, here I come! [walks by Patrick, who's sunning himself on his rock]
Patrick: Oh, hey there, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [to himself] Be strong, be strong, be strong, be strong! Good afternoon, Mr. Star. [Walks off]
Patrick: See you later!
[Cuts to Sandy's Treedome, where Sandy is trying to comfort a sobbing SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy! It was awful! Truly awful! We were like complete strangers!
Sandy: You don't need to know everything about your best friend. That's what keeps the friendship interesting!
SpongeBob: Really?
Sandy: Maybe you and Patrick just need some time apart.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Yeah! I'll have lots of fun without Patrick! [walks off to Sandy's door, and on his way out, he breaks down in tears again]
Sandy: [To herself] What a crybaby.
[Cuts to SpongeBob walking]
SpongeBob: I don't need Patrick! I can have a good time all by myself! [takes out jellyfishing net] I can go jellyfishing! [sobers up] Patrick and I used to go jellyfishing...I can play leapfrog! [jumps over a rock, then pulls it up on him and tries to toss it over his head, but winds up under it and tries to slide out from under it] I can blow bubbles! [blows a bubble, but it looks just like Patrick,] Uh, maybe not. [bubble pops, SpongeBob sighs]
Patrick: [walking by] Leedle leedle leedle lee!
SpongeBob: Oh, it's Patrick! I can't let him see me! [Drills a hole in the sand and hides in it. Patrick skips over the hole. SpongeBob checks to make sure he's gone, then exits the hole]
Patrick: Leedle leedle lee!
SpongeBob: Well, he doesn't seem to be missing me at all. [Patrick walks off, still singing]
Patrick: Leedle leedle lee!
SpongeBob: Nice that he's gotten over our friendship so quickly! [SpongeBob then returns to the whole, and digs a tunnel that's following Patrick.. Patrick is seen entering the Gym while SpongeBob watches him from afar]
SpongeBob: Patrick works out at the gym? [Takes out binocular and watches Patrick exiting the Gym the Larry the Lobster] And he's hanging out with Larry the Lobster? Maybe I don't know much about Patrick, either.
[cuts to Larry and Patrick entering a cooking supply shop while SpongeBob spies on them]
SpongeBob: [watches Patrick from the inside of a blender] Patrick's shopping for cookery? Very suspicious. Oh! He's coming back! [Hides back in the blender. Patrick comes to the blender and presses a button, activating the blender. Patrick then leaves. SpongeBob hand comes out of the blender and turns it off. And SpongeBob, now liquefied, exits the blender.. Cuts to Larry and Patrick purchasing something from the magic shop. As the exit, one of the top hats from the top hat display follows them]
SpongeBob: [From inside the hat] Hold it right there, Patrick! [jumps out of the hat]
Larry the Lobster: Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick: We were just coming to see you.
SpongeBob: [angrily] Oh, I'll bet you were... to tell me about your new best friend, Larry, I suppose?!
Larry: Whoa, settle down, little dude. I don't want to get in the middle of, whatever this is. [Walks off]
Patrick: Well Larry is a great guy, loads of talent, and good looks.
SpongeBob: I know, he is pretty amazing...
Patrick: He's not my best friend. He was just helping me buy a present.
SpongeBob: [angrily] Who for? Sandy?
Patrick: No. For my REAL best friend, SpongeBob SquarePants. [holds out the bag he's holding]
SpongeBob: Really? [Takes the bag and opens it up] For me? What is it? [Takes out a rubber nose, mustache, and glasses disguise] Oh! I love it! You DO know me, best friend!
Patrick: [wearing the same disguise] I got a pair for me too! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, you're the bestest, best friend Patrick! [puts on his disguise] How do I look?
Patrick: [Screams] How should I know, mysterious stranger?! [runs away, screaming. SpongeBob sighs. And the episode comes to a close]
